"The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games, #1)",0439023483,4.7,theReader278,I loved reading this wonderful book! It is a story that keeps you entertained for hours.,Anonymous,"There's really not much to say other than I just read a book that was equal part disturbing and completely compelling. 
I can't even say how much this book effected me, both emotionally and physically. (I bought a bow and arrow set. No kidding.)
I think this is a book that will stick with me for a very long time. 
Caution: It's violent and a lot of parts are very unsettling, but if you can get through it, it's really an amazing read. Opens your mind, for sure.
I can't wait for the sequel.",Sarah_R,"When I got my copy of the Hunger Games as an advanced, I devoured it in less than a day. It's one of those ""can't put down even if it's 3 in the morning"" type of books. I knew, quickly, it would be a recommendation I'd offer to ANYone looking for a great, new teen read. What I liked most about the book is its premise: in a maybe-distant-not-distinguishable future, Katniss, our heroine, finds herself participating in the ultimate reality TV show--a fight to the death. For teenagers in Katniss's world, a lottery could send them to the Capitol to fight in these Hunger Games, where the victor is the last teen standing. With a little romance, humor among the carnage, and an interesting new future set up, Collins' first book of the Hunger Games series is unforgettable."
"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Harry Potter, #1)",0439554934,4.6,Guest,"So I refused to read Harry Potter for years. I saw the first two movies, and lost my interest. I could never understand the hype surrounding this children's book. Then the book Seven came out, and all my seemingly mature, professional friends stormed the bookstores, locking themselves in their apartments for four days, emerging with a glow unparalleled to any I have seen.        A sheep that I am, I decided to not stand out and bought the first Harry Potter book. A day later I emerged from my dwelling, smile on my face and a need to read more about Harry. Whoever said that Harry was for kids only? For shame!      J.K. Rowling is one of those rare novelists who write flawlessly, capturing imagination, hopes and dreams, addressing children and adults alike. Great story line, clear messages and a whole new world to explore are just some of the attributes of the first Harry Potter. Harry, a wizard by birth and unaware of it, is 11 and living with his mother's sister and her family. An orphan, Harry is treated as such in a very Dickensonian way by his adopted family, who detests Harry for being different. That all changes when Harry starts attending Hogwarts, a school for wizards and witches, where a whole new world unfolds before him. The new school is not without dangers, and Harry learns the truth about his parents' deaths, as well as about the lightning shaped scar on his own forehead that made Harry a celebrity in the world of witchcraft.       A fantastic novel that kept me yearning for more. And thankfully, there IS more. Highly recommeded.",Balina,The book is definitely a must read. I have enjoyed reading all the H.P. books from start to finish.,Anonymous,"This book pulled me in from the beginning, when Harry was placed on the doorstep. I barely put it down. J.K. Rowling creates a magical world and you feel like you are Harry because you are experiencing Hogwarts for the first time, like him. Even though they are not normal experiences, you feel kind of like him, just thrust in. Thoroughly well written and very enjoyable."
"Twilight (Twilight, #1)",0316015849,4.5,Anonymous,Still reading Twilight. Also love HYPNOTIC by Maria E. another great CRAZE! LOVE LOVE LOVE,FairyDust90,"I had heard about this book from one of my sister's friends and I never thought anything of it. Then two of my closest friends started RAVING about this book so I decided to look it up. I read the first chapter online and was hooked. I quickly bought the first one and I could not put it down. You really grow to love and care for Bella, Edward, and the whole Cullen family. They each have their own personalities which you also grow to love. Twilight is exactly my type of heroine!",theReader278,I loved reading this book! It was unique and the story was fantastic.
To Kill a Mockingbird,0061120081,4.5,Anonymous,"When I first looked at the book ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" I thought that it looked like a boring old book that I was going to be forced to read. I was one hundred percent positive that I would not like it one bit. But by the time I was on the 6th chapter I could not put it down. This book was amazing. Although it was written through the eyes of a six-year-old girl it is a very deep book. The concept of racism and prejudice in this book was shown perfectly through the eyes of Scout. The innocence that the victims, Tom Robinson and Boo Radley, showed was clear throughout the whole book. I enjoyed this book for several reasons. One is the fact that even though Harper Lee wrote this book in 1960 the book opened my eyes to the fact that the concept of racism and prejudice is still happening today. This was an interesting glimpse into this subject for me because I live in a very diverse community and all of my friends and peers are pretty tolerant of each others' differences. Reading this book taught me that racism could affect everyone.  Using interesting characters and getting me involved in their personal stories made the issues of civil rights and racism more real to me. Usually when you have to read about racism it involves dates in a history book and people you can't relate to, but ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" was written in a way that was easy to read and more people can relate to Scout and her family. I also liked this book because it showed how growing up is an important and inevitable part of life. At some point you can't shelter children from every bad thing in the world that comes along. In the story, Atticus eventually had to sit down with Jem and Scout and explain to them about bigotry and what was going on in their community.  He understood that they were growing up and, in turn, he set an example of what a good person was like. I liked how even though the book was written through Scout's eyes, Harper Lee still was able to catch how Jem was affected by having Scout observe the changes in her brother and talk to her Dad about it.  Even though the book touches on more mature ideas and concepts, I feel that this book is a sure hit for all ages. This book is a true classic and unquestionably deserved the Pulitzer Prize.",Renelche,"This is such a moving book.  It is rich with southern texture.  A coming of age tale in the Depression Era south, the book speaks to people today as much as it did when it was written.  Every time I read it, I find that it tells me more about children, adults, feelings, and how we deal with one another as people.  I also find that, each time I read it, I am uplifted.",theReader278,I loved reading this wonderful book! It is a story that keeps you entertained for hours.

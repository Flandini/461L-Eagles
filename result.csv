"The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games, #1)",0439023483,Suzanne Collins,Barnes and Noble,4.7,theReader278,I loved reading this wonderful book! It is a story that keeps you entertained for hours.
"The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games, #1)",0439023483,Suzanne Collins,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Anonymous,"There's really not much to say other than I just read a book that was equal part disturbing and completely compelling. 
I can't even say how much this book effected me, both emotionally and physically. (I bought a bow and arrow set. No kidding.)
I think this is a book that will stick with me for a very long time. 
Caution: It's violent and a lot of parts are very unsettling, but if you can get through it, it's really an amazing read. Opens your mind, for sure.
I can't wait for the sequel."
"The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games, #1)",0439023483,Suzanne Collins,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Sarah_R,"When I got my copy of the Hunger Games as an advanced, I devoured it in less than a day. It's one of those ""can't put down even if it's 3 in the morning"" type of books. I knew, quickly, it would be a recommendation I'd offer to ANYone looking for a great, new teen read. What I liked most about the book is its premise: in a maybe-distant-not-distinguishable future, Katniss, our heroine, finds herself participating in the ultimate reality TV show--a fight to the death. For teenagers in Katniss's world, a lottery could send them to the Capitol to fight in these Hunger Games, where the victor is the last teen standing. With a little romance, humor among the carnage, and an interesting new future set up, Collins' first book of the Hunger Games series is unforgettable."
"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Harry Potter, #1)",0439554934,"J.K. Rowling, Mary GrandPré",Barnes and Noble,4.6,Guest,"So I refused to read Harry Potter for years. I saw the first two movies, and lost my interest. I could never understand the hype surrounding this children's book. Then the book Seven came out, and all my seemingly mature, professional friends stormed the bookstores, locking themselves in their apartments for four days, emerging with a glow unparalleled to any I have seen.        A sheep that I am, I decided to not stand out and bought the first Harry Potter book. A day later I emerged from my dwelling, smile on my face and a need to read more about Harry. Whoever said that Harry was for kids only? For shame!      J.K. Rowling is one of those rare novelists who write flawlessly, capturing imagination, hopes and dreams, addressing children and adults alike. Great story line, clear messages and a whole new world to explore are just some of the attributes of the first Harry Potter. Harry, a wizard by birth and unaware of it, is 11 and living with his mother's sister and her family. An orphan, Harry is treated as such in a very Dickensonian way by his adopted family, who detests Harry for being different. That all changes when Harry starts attending Hogwarts, a school for wizards and witches, where a whole new world unfolds before him. The new school is not without dangers, and Harry learns the truth about his parents' deaths, as well as about the lightning shaped scar on his own forehead that made Harry a celebrity in the world of witchcraft.       A fantastic novel that kept me yearning for more. And thankfully, there IS more. Highly recommeded."
"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Harry Potter, #1)",0439554934,"J.K. Rowling, Mary GrandPré",Barnes and Noble,4.6,Balina,The book is definitely a must read. I have enjoyed reading all the H.P. books from start to finish.
"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Harry Potter, #1)",0439554934,"J.K. Rowling, Mary GrandPré",Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"This book pulled me in from the beginning, when Harry was placed on the doorstep. I barely put it down. J.K. Rowling creates a magical world and you feel like you are Harry because you are experiencing Hogwarts for the first time, like him. Even though they are not normal experiences, you feel kind of like him, just thrust in. Thoroughly well written and very enjoyable."
"Twilight (Twilight, #1)",0316015849,Stephenie Meyer,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,Still reading Twilight. Also love HYPNOTIC by Maria E. another great CRAZE! LOVE LOVE LOVE
"Twilight (Twilight, #1)",0316015849,Stephenie Meyer,Barnes and Noble,4.5,FairyDust90,"I had heard about this book from one of my sister's friends and I never thought anything of it. Then two of my closest friends started RAVING about this book so I decided to look it up. I read the first chapter online and was hooked. I quickly bought the first one and I could not put it down. You really grow to love and care for Bella, Edward, and the whole Cullen family. They each have their own personalities which you also grow to love. Twilight is exactly my type of heroine!"

To Kill a Mockingbird,0061120081,Harper Lee,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"When I first looked at the book ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" I thought that it looked like a boring old book that I was going to be forced to read. I was one hundred percent positive that I would not like it one bit. But by the time I was on the 6th chapter I could not put it down. This book was amazing. Although it was written through the eyes of a six-year-old girl it is a very deep book. The concept of racism and prejudice in this book was shown perfectly through the eyes of Scout. The innocence that the victims, Tom Robinson and Boo Radley, showed was clear throughout the whole book. I enjoyed this book for several reasons. One is the fact that even though Harper Lee wrote this book in 1960 the book opened my eyes to the fact that the concept of racism and prejudice is still happening today. This was an interesting glimpse into this subject for me because I live in a very diverse community and all of my friends and peers are pretty tolerant of each others' differences. Reading this book taught me that racism could affect everyone.  Using interesting characters and getting me involved in their personal stories made the issues of civil rights and racism more real to me. Usually when you have to read about racism it involves dates in a history book and people you can't relate to, but ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" was written in a way that was easy to read and more people can relate to Scout and her family. I also liked this book because it showed how growing up is an important and inevitable part of life. At some point you can't shelter children from every bad thing in the world that comes along. In the story, Atticus eventually had to sit down with Jem and Scout and explain to them about bigotry and what was going on in their community.  He understood that they were growing up and, in turn, he set an example of what a good person was like. I liked how even though the book was written through Scout's eyes, Harper Lee still was able to catch how Jem was affected by having Scout observe the changes in her brother and talk to her Dad about it.  Even though the book touches on more mature ideas and concepts, I feel that this book is a sure hit for all ages. This book is a true classic and unquestionably deserved the Pulitzer Prize."
To Kill a Mockingbird,0061120081,Harper Lee,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Renelche,"This is such a moving book.  It is rich with southern texture.  A coming of age tale in the Depression Era south, the book speaks to people today as much as it did when it was written.  Every time I read it, I find that it tells me more about children, adults, feelings, and how we deal with one another as people.  I also find that, each time I read it, I am uplifted."

The Great Gatsby,0743273567,F. Scott Fitzgerald,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Artazen,"Want to buy. Will not. YOU CAN NOT JUSTIFY CHARGING THIS PRICE FOR THIS BOOK. CAN NOT. I HATE having to complain but this trend of jacking up prices for our computer file nooks is becoming common practice and is an insult to the intelligence of every nook/nookcolor owner. And we can't use our discount card for what reason. We want to be loyal customers. Please inspire us to do so. If you did not know, we want quality nookbooks and apps at fair prices. If you are a fellow nook owner and see an example of nookbook price abuse, add a comment to your review. Or not."
The Great Gatsby,0743273567,F. Scott Fitzgerald,Barnes and Noble,4.1,leehoove,"Though the ending isn't Disney-worthy (my usual preference), Fitzgerald did a marvelous job.  The book centers around the mysterious character of Gatsby, and, as you turn the pages, his history unravels before your eyes, as well as the narrator's--Nick.  Nick is an ""average"" guy whom we feel we can trust--because he follows his father's advice and does not immediately judge (or so he says).  The book will make you yearn for a love you know is impossible, cringe with embarrassment at a shameful past, blush at the awkwardness encountered on nearly every page, laugh and cry at the dramatic irony, and have you researching the Charleston (the dance, not the city--this is set in the 1920s, after all!). It may not be considered a typical love story, but the electricity between Daisy and Gatsby is too strong to deny and it always has me wondering what will happen (though I know).  Read for irony, read for lessons, read to be taken back to another time--no, another dimension in which the music never dies and the party is perpetual."
The Great Gatsby,0743273567,F. Scott Fitzgerald,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"Too expensive! I was planning to buy, but I will look for a hard copy. If you want happy nook owners, dont overcharge for classics!"
The Fault in Our Stars,0525478817,John Green,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Shaun_Rice,"Let's face it: Cancer is a popular topic among the literary world, both in fiction and non-fiction. For years, authors have penned the tumultuous lives of those affected by cancer, as well as the lives of those who know people with cancer. I have been following Green's work for several years now, and I have been consistently impressed with the work he has done. However, his previous novels have always fallen short of excellence, something that has changed with the Young Adult author's newest outing. The Fault in Our Stars is wonderful. Plain and simple. Too often ""cancer books"" are downtrodden with overemotional drama that saturates the reading experience with misery. Fortunately, this book changes that. The tone of the book is primarily humorous, as is Green's specialty, and does not dwell excessively on drama. That does not mean, however, that the severity of the characters' situation is ignored. Rather, the cancer is more of a supporting character, always hovering around our narrator, but never entirely interfering with the flow of the story. The cancer simply exists, and while it makes itself known, it does not do so loudly. This offers a nice change of pace for those accustomed to the achingly detailed books about cancer and hospice they might have read in the past. Most importantly, the characters are not the wise and all-knowing cancer kids that is common in many stories of young people suffering with the disease. They offer their perspective, but they are scarcely blatant about it. Hazel, our narrator, offers often amusing observations about the world she lives in as well as the situation she has found herself in, but she is not and does not claim to be an all-knowing book of infinite knowledge. The same is to be said about Gus, our heroic best friend. While the story lacks extravagance, that doesn't stop it from becoming one of the best novels I've read in recent memory. It is a stubborn little book, and will not be easily forgotten like so many other books lining the bookshelves of the present. The prose is quiet and minimal, while still retaining a sort of muted beauty. The dialogue is sharp and witty. The characters are well-drawn out, and you might even find yourself wanting to hug the venerable (and fictional) author Peter Van Houten by the end of the book. In conclusion: Whether you have enjoyed Green's previous works or are familiar with his on-going YouTube phenomenon, you will certainly enjoy The Fault in Our Stars. It's a fantastic book filled with fantastic characters, and is written by a fantastic author. This is destined to be one of the best books of the year, and should not be missed."
The Fault in Our Stars,0525478817,John Green,Barnes and Noble,4.6,-Hagen-,"This book is not only for the young set. There is great benefit to all who read this. It&rsquo;s not only about two teens battling cancer; it&rsquo;s about a lesson to all of us to live our lives every day, every minute. We should be thankful for this time especially if we are lucky enough to find love and be capable of giving. This story is beautiful, funny, heartbreaking and poignant. Gus and Hazel made me laugh, cry, laugh all over again, and cry yet again. I&rsquo;m still crying!"
The Fault in Our Stars,0525478817,John Green,Barnes and Noble,4.6,elschneider,"I prolonged reading this one. I knew it was going to be good - not only because of the rave reviews I'd been hearing, but also because the subject matter was a tough one to tackle. And yet, I let it sit in my TBR pile for three months, while I stalled and read other books.

cancer touches many lives, and everyone deals with it differently. cancer touched my life in June of 2006, when my mom was diagnosed with late-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (cancer of the liver). It was predicted she'd have anywhere between four to six months, and that was with all the surgeries, chemo, and whatever else they could throw her way. Proving the doctors wrong and opting out of all Western medicines and treatments, she gave us four wonderful years.

In exactly two weeks from today, it will have been two years since my mom passed away. And maybe it's the timing, that caused me to finally pick up THE FAULT IN OUR STARS and start reading the first page of a book, I secretly think I'd been dreading to read all-together.

But what I found amongst those pages, was an exceptional story - and while beautifully written, it was tremendously bittersweet. Anyone who has had even a glimpse into this devastating disease, can completely relate to how raw and heartbreaking this journey truly was.

The relationship between Hazel and Augustus from start to finish, was nothing short of believable - full of emotion, yet flavored throughout with well-timed humor, as the two made their way through such unfortunate circumstances. Neither of them gave credit to their cancer - it simply was what it was, and they both dealt with the hand they were given, in the best way they knew how.

You may have noticed (or not?) that I didn't capitalize the c in the word cancer, anywhere above - and that's because I don't believe it deserves that kind of credit or attention. One day we'll figure out how this horrible disease takes over the human body, metastasizes throughout, and ultimately, takes the ones we love. And we'll stop it. Until then, it's exceptional books like THE FAULT IN OUR STARS that makes you realize, it doesn't matter who you are or what your age is, in the end, cancer affects us all.

John Green is a master at story-telling; a true artist in the way he delivered a journey that could have gone in a non-favorable direction, all too easily. A FAULT IN OUR STARS was an excellent read and a favorite YA contemporary for me - this is one I highly recommend to everyone."
The Hobbit,0618260307,J.R.R. Tolkien,Barnes and Noble,4.5,ExtraBitterStoat,"I've loved the Hobbit for a long time, and was excited to see an eBook version come out.  ""Finally, I can read it on my Nook"", I thought.  I was extremely disappointed in some of the choices of the formatters.  Tolkien's illustrations are included, but are reduced to a postage stamp size, for some reason.  The Nook screen has a very high resolution, and the illustrations should take advantage of it!  The illustrations even look terrible on the tiny iPhone screen.  Also, for some reason, the lines of verse are irregularly spaced.  Sometimes you'll get 5 stanzas on the screen, sometimes two or three with bizarre spacing.  If I'm paying for a product, I expect a professional look and consistent formatting!"
The Hobbit,0618260307,J.R.R. Tolkien,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,This is a fabulous edition of the Hobbit.  We purchased it for our family library.  My children loved the illustrations.  It is a bit pricy - but a wonderful addition to any collection.
The Hobbit,0618260307,J.R.R. Tolkien,Barnes and Noble,4.5,GVSreading,"The Hobbit (the prelude to the Lord of the Rings) starts out great and never goes downhill from there. When it starts out with a three foot tall person being thrown out of his home with nothing, and coming back the richest person in his country, it will almost always be a great book.
  In the beginning a hobbit named Bilbo gets thrown out of his home and goes on an adventure.  The following exert is Gandalf the wizard getting Bilbo out the door. ""But. """"No time for that!"" ""But.""""No time for that either!""   He then goes on a fantastic journey with talking spiders, goblins, greedy elves, and..riddles.  That last part may not make sense, but it will when you read it and decide it is an incredible book.
  I think it is an occasionally funny, exciting, fantasy genre adventure story.  It sprinkles in humor sparingly at good points in the story.  It is not a book I would recommend for those below eleven or twelve years of age.
 The Hobbit is, in my opinion, an incredible read that should be worth a look from everyone.
 The Hobbit is the greatest book I have ever read, and a true classic.  If you like The Lord of the Rings movies, you will love this book.  When I set it down, I was captivated by its story, and its incredible quality."
The Catcher in the Rye,0316769177,J.D. Salinger,Barnes and Noble,4.2,CC19,"J.D. Salinger's coming of age novel The Catcher in the Rye has delightfully captured the attention of readers for decades.  Its popularity is primarily, but not exclusively, due to the realism behind the plot, characters, and themes.  Although the story takes place during the late 1940s, teenagers everywhere can still relate to the sixteen year old protagonist, Holden Caulfield.  The combination of his criticism, bitterness, and pessimism towards society was carefully crafted to create Holden as a unique narrator with many conflicting thoughts.  In fact, Holden feels so torn between becoming an adult and staying a child that he essentially alienates himself from those who have conformed to one or the other.  The distress and confusion of growing up is the underlying theme that follows Holden throughout the entire novel.
From just the first chapter of the novel readers come to learn that Holden is not your typical adolescent boy.  He does not hold back when criticizing his ""phony"" schoolmates, whose obsessions include girls, sex, smoking, and drinking.  Although Holden feels compelled to engage in the latter two activities himself, he does not necessarily agree with it.  He is merely trying to find a medium between childhood and adulthood.  Feeling alone and isolated, Holden carries out the extreme by leaving his prep school to escape those around him already engrossed in maturing into adults.  The story follows with a number of events that all contribute to Holden's intriguing journey to understanding himself; a journey many young people in the world today go on themselves.  
Because Salinger's themes are so universal yet realistic, The Catcher in the Rye is found to be satisfying and relatable to all types of readers.  Holden and his struggles bring each reader back to a time in their own lives when they were going through a drastic change.  For that reason The Catcher in the Rye can easily be considered timeless.  The thought of keeping this novel off libraries' shelves because of its vulgar language, sexual references, and so-called promotion of drug use is ludicrous.  Do not let the accusations and believers of censorship keep you from becoming immersed into the world of Holden Caulfield."
The Catcher in the Rye,0316769177,J.D. Salinger,Barnes and Noble,4.2,JRews,"I read this book this year for school, I was in a bad mood and I ended up reading half of it in one night. Its a book that's so easy to understand, its so human. There's no action or any thrill much at all besides the everyday life of Holden Caulfield. I recommend this book to anyone who's human. Its enjoyable and relatable. Also, I love the Holden."
The Catcher in the Rye,0316769177,J.D. Salinger,Barnes and Noble,4.2,KLJoy,"The novel ""The Catcher in the Rye"" by J.D. Salinger was written in 1951. However, it is still being read in schools today. Unlike many timeless novels, ""The Catcher in the Rye"" not only provides a strong message that still resonates today, it also is a fascinating, creative piece of writing. 
""The Catcher in the Rye"" takes place in the 1940s and tells the story of Holden Caulfield, a troubled teenager haunted by the death of his little brother. The story follows Holden as he runs away from private school while hoping to find to find happiness somewhere in the streets of New York. Holden is both the protagonist and antagonist of his story. He is stubborn, rude, and judgmental without a cause. On the other hand, Holden loves his little sister and wants to protect children from the world around them. He is broken and in search of something he can't seem to find. He is searching for love. When his brother died, Holden lost someone who loved him. Even though Holden couldn't see the love depart, he feels it slipping away. Holden's parents are too caught up in their own pain to recognize that Holden is struggling. Holden is forced to bear all of his burdens by himself. It is this struggle that makes the novel timeless. In essence we are all Holden, a little lost and a little broken, but always pushing forward, looking for a glimmer of happiness in the distance. Everyone knows the feeling of being in a place where everyone else belongs. Anyone can relate to Holden's struggle to find himself in a place where people look down on those who differ from the status quo.  ""The Catcher in the Rye"" makes the experience both poignant and humorous. Holden is a teenage boy whose thoughts are often ludicrous and socially incorrect. J.D. Salinger knew that there was more to writing a novel then just getting the message across. He accomplishes it with comedy and intrigue. It is hard not to laugh when Holden is lying to a women about his age while calling those around him phonies. ""The Catcher in the Rye"" is a classic because it would remain a talented piece of writing even without a moral ""point"". The novel merges timeless and engaging with an effortlessness that many authors can't achieve."
"Angels & Demons  (Robert Langdon, #1)",1416524797,Dan Brown,Barnes and Noble,4.4,ticareader,"I reluctantly picked this book up. I had read the DaVinci Code really just to see what the big fuss was, but never finished it. Dan Brown redeemed himself with this one. I could not put it down. I love fast paced books and this one definitely is that...now I have to decide if I'll ruin it all by watching the movie, but we'll see."
"Angels & Demons  (Robert Langdon, #1)",1416524797,Dan Brown,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Dave2012,"Robert Langdon and Vittoria Vetra combine to create an amazing story-line with many twists, turns, and surprises in Dan Brown¿s Angels and Demons.  This book has a fair amount of fabrication, along with a number of true, while unknown facts, all of which combine with first-rate and competent characters to create a never failing, addictive novel.     In Vatican City, Rome an ancient and thought-to-be-extinct demonic brotherhood emerges to declare science¿s jurisdiction over religion.  While the brotherhood of the Illuminati is factual, this conspiracy and attack are completely fictional.  Brown¿s interlinking of these two very distinct elements combine into a woven quilt, creating the story of Angels and Demons.     Robert Langdon is a world-renowned Harvard symbologist called to Switzerland¿s Conseil Europ&#233;en pour la Recherche Nucl&#233;aire facility (CERN) to scrutinize a corpse branded with an Illuminati ambigram.  Langdon¿s brilliance connects with Vittoria Vetra¿s common sense to create a kind of juggernaut against the terror of the brotherhood.  This well-rounded team is prone to penetrate the protected Illuminati.     Angels and Demons is a great book that I would recommend to anyone interested.  I am a freshman in High School and had no problem with any of the vocabulary in the story.  I was also intrigued instantaneously and addicted by the third or fourth chapter.  The other great thing about this book is that it is not so predictable that you can tell exactly what is going to happen.  But it does not make you think ¿Where on Earth is this going?¿ and no one likes this.  The novel mixes elements well and creates an entertaining story that I would advise to everyone."
"Angels & Demons  (Robert Langdon, #1)",1416524797,Dan Brown,Barnes and Noble,4.4,unknowing-savior,"Unfortunately, I read Da Vinci Code first, then went back to Angels and Demons.  What I noticed was that the style was identical and the characters were similar and the plot was quite parallel.  It was almost like reading the same book back to back.  Neither book was badly written, it's just that the style showed no variety and read back to back was a let down."
Pride and Prejudice,0679783261,Jane Austen,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Alyssa2010,"I recently read Pride and Prejudice to relax, and I can honestly say that it is one of the best novels I have ever read. The characters of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are well developed and enthralling. Elizabeth is the classic stubborn and brazen heroine; a no nonsense kind of girl whose personality from their first meeting rubs Mr. Darcy the wrong way. Through several different personal struggles we see these characters grow as individuals, as well as closer to each other. It is a must read for all the hopeless romantics out there."
Pride and Prejudice,0679783261,Jane Austen,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"'It is a truth universally acknowledged that any man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of...' a copy of Pride and Prejudice. I had felt guilty that I had watched many film versions of the book before actually reading it. That being said, I grabbed a copy at Barnes and Noble and ran home to read. I'll admit that the language of Jane Austen's day can be a bit confusing at first, but after the first three chapters, I was transported to eighteenth century England, sipping tea, and watching Elizabeth bedazzle Fitzwilliam while dancing at the Netherfield ball. This is a definite must-read for any, true booklover. Bon appetit!"
Pride and Prejudice,0679783261,Jane Austen,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"This is a scan of the 1894 George Allen edition.  There are a lot of problems with the scanner software not being able to recognize letters, or maybe the document was just dirty, but you have to do a lot of guessing as to the words. A difficult read and not for those who have not read Pride and Prejudice before this."
The Kite Runner,1594480001,Khaled Hosseini,Barnes and Noble,4.6,songcatchers,"The Kite Runner takes place in both Afghanistan and California. It's told from the perspective of Amir, first as a little boy and later on as a man. Amir grows up a privileged boy in Afghanistan. His best friend is Hassan, the son of the family servant. Amir is Pashtun, Hassan is Hazara. Amir is Sunni, Hassan is Shi'a. Their differences don't change the fact that these boys were breastfed together, learned to crawl together and are basically inseparable. Then everything changes. Amir witnesses a horror done to Hassan and cannot forgive himself for not stepping in to help him and to do what is right. In 1975 Afghanistan is in turmoil and Amir, then 12 years old, and his father move to San Francisco. Amir grows up feeling guilt and self-hatred over the issue with Hassan and the subsequent results. Then one day, twenty five years after Amir has left Afghanistan, he receives a phone call summoning him back to the place he had hoped to forget. The caller tells Amir ""there is a way to be good again.""The Kite Runner has for it's hero a very flawed human being.....but that's what makes him so believable. Amir the boy does a very cowardly, dastardly deed but Amir the man stands up to the Taliban and even more importantly, he stands up for what is right. This book has forgiveness, redemption and courage for it's main themes. We see how strong the ties of friendship and loyalty can become through the eyes of Amir and a broken little Afghan boy. The setting in Kabul and the culture of the Afghan people make for an interesting backdrop to an unforgettable novel."
The Kite Runner,1594480001,Khaled Hosseini,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Debbie-J-1970,"The story is tragic and heart rending. At some points I really disliked the main character, but I could relate with his frustrations and guilt. He redeemed himself with his bravery in the end. The characters are deep, and the interactions between them are as natural as if the author had witnessed them himself (or, indeed, experienced them!). There is a little bit of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn in the main character and his hair-lipped friend, respectively. I loved how many plot threads from the main character's childhood came back to him in adulthood, which brought back all the main character's childhood anxieties. I have never known a thing about Afghanistan, except what I hear on the news, but this book brought that beautiful, beleaguered country to life for me in ways I never could have imagined. I was transported to and immersed in a world that is totally beyond the awareness of most westerners. Through Hosseini's magic, I became part of that world and literally felt young Amir's and Hassan's every feeling. A superb novel, both historical and relevant for our times. This is a well written novel that's very culturally and politically aware, and it is certainly worth the time."
The Kite Runner,1594480001,Khaled Hosseini,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"I was given this book about two years ago and it sat on my shelf until now, and I cant believe I didnt read it sooner. I cried, I laughed, and feel in to deep thought throughout this whole book. Its beautiful and you will fall in love with the characters right away. Hassan was my favorite character and you will love him too. I cried so much throughout this book because it evoked such feeling inside of me, do yourself a favor and BUY THE BOOK!"
"Divergent (Divergent, #1)",0062024035,Veronica Roth,Barnes and Noble,4.6,me_chelle54,This book took my breath away! It's been a while since I was so captivated by a book it was in my hand everywhere I went. I started this book early in the morning and refused to put it down until finished. I fell into the rhythm of Tris' voice and was surrounded by this dystopian world she lives in. From beginning to end you find yourself holding your breath in amazement of where this story is taking you. I will be recommending this title to all of my customers!!
"Divergent (Divergent, #1)",0062024035,Veronica Roth,Barnes and Noble,4.6,theReader278,One of the best books I have read. It is a story that keeps you entertained for hours.
"Divergent (Divergent, #1)",0062024035,Veronica Roth,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"This book blew my mind. Some people say that this is the new Hunger Games, but I personally think it's better. I have never read a book that literally stunned me, for a minute after I finished reading it i just sat there basking in the amazingness of this book. I loved the characters (especially Four) and the plot was wonderful. My ultimate favorite part of this book was Tris' voice. The way she narrates the book make it unlike any book I have read, but not at all in a bad way. The only thing that bugged me was the ending. The book is about 480-500 pages long, with the ending being about 50 pages. To me the ending didn't seem complete, but that is probably because it's a series and if the ending seems complete then no one will buy the next book. My ultimate favorite part of this book was Tris' voice. The way she narrates the book make it unlike any book I have read, but not at all in a bad way. All in all i can not wait until the next book in this trilogy comes out."
1984,0451524934,"George Orwell, Erich Fromm, Celâl Üster",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Jessi-21,"So what can I say about this book that hasn't been said before? Having read it I can see how it has become regarded as classic fiction. Of course the year 1984 has come and gone and many folks say had it been titled ""2009"" it would have been much more accurate.
For those of you who haven't read it, it is a complex novel but with a fairly basic plot. The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a functioning member of a society in the future who meets a woman he is attracted to. Much of the book surrounds their attempt to form a relationship in this society that just won't allow that sort of thing. Of course the real point and value of the novel is to illustrate where our current society may be headed if we don't change course, a sort of anti-utopian (dystopian?) novel. This book has brought us common terms such as ""Big Brother"", ""doublethink"", and ""thought police."" There are long sections where Winston reads to his girl friend from the official government manual detailing how the society came to be as well as the evolution of the government-speak (""Newspeak"") language. I am glad that I've read this novel but at the same time I can't say that I would ever want to read it again. My political/societal views are already pretty much cemented in place and this book, while thought provoking, did not change my views. I do agree that it should be studied at the High School level though, not only for its value to the world of literature but also as a way to kick start young people's thinking on what a society should and shouldn't be. 
Essentially 1984 presents a juggernaut state that has become unmoored from whatever benign ideals once berthed it and has drifted off beyond site of a reassuring oasis-like coastline. A state in which its inhabitants no longer strive to achieve their original goals be they based on economical, religious or political ideals and have allowed the state to become a living entity in itself with the destruction of the human spirit as its sole aim.
 
Be sure to watch the three different movies made from this book:
1984 (1954) Peter Cushing is Winston Smith
1984 (1956) Edmond O'Brien is Winston Smith
Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984) John Hurt is Winston Smith"
1984,0451524934,"George Orwell, Erich Fromm, Celâl Üster",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"I am a high school student. This was not a required reading peice for me. I saw it sitting in Barnes and Noble on a shelf with suggeseted reading. When I first started reading the book it was BORING! I had to force myself to go on. After about the first hundred pages though, it started to get interesting. The story is ok, but this is a book you shouldn't be reading for just the plot. There is so much more to it than the plot. Every person who reads this book will get a different meaning from it.    To me this book says that peoples minds can be molded very easily. Even the strong can be made weak after a certain amount of torture. Perhaps this is a negative thought, but it started me thinking on a much larger scale. I owe a lot of things to this book. I think more clearly since I read this book. I think about more important things, things most 16 yr olds wouldn't think of. This book has truely shown me the light towards literature so to speak.    Whether you are required to read this or not, I think you should. If you have already read it, read it again. I'm sure 10 years from now the book will have a deeper meaning. I can't wait to read it again and find out what those meanings will be."
1984,0451524934,"George Orwell, Erich Fromm, Celâl Üster",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"I came to 1984 after reading a series of novels by Russian authors about life in Stalingrad during the onslaught by Hitler and then after the cruelty of Stalin. It's easy to see how Orwell extended the grim realities of the concentration camps of Germany and the labor camps of Russia into this dark prophecy. Of course, in many instances his vision has become realized. Big Brother seeks to invade our privacy at every turn via electronic media. Governments pose rhetoric immersed in 'doublespeak'. The Thought Police exist to bully our free expression. Power is exercised by imposing real human suffering upon multitudes. 'The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent.' Oil comes to mind here. And munitions. And diverse other commodities. In 1984 the war is endless. 'Everywhere there is the same pyramidical structure, the same worship of a semi-divine leader, the same economy existing by and for continuous war.' Sound familiar? The High, or the 'priests of power' only fall when assaulted by the Middle and usually assisted by the Low classes. Then the Middle becomes the High and oppresses the Low for which change only means a new master. The protagonist, Winston, a 'minority of one' questions his own sanity but ultimately defends the 'spirit of man' as a force which cannot be overpowered. In the closing pages we see Orwell's true convictions about the infallible power of Big Brother and the triumph of the human spirit. This dark view has real overtones of Nietzsche and Machiavelli, who wrote with the view of realism based upon the inhumanity they witnessed in their heydays by 'princes' with the 'will to power'. But the 'spirit of man' is truly formidable and cannot be overcome, except temporarily, by totalitarian figures and corrupt democracies. The next US national election will be telling about down which road America will travel. 1984 is a cautionary, post-World War II tale but to say it's unrealistically dark and couldn't happen here and now is to overlook eons of history. And to be unconscious of the powers of orthodoxy infringing greedily and corporately upon the spirit of man in our time."
Animal Farm,0452284244,George Orwell,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Maria_of_amor,"Animal Farm is about the animals on a farm uprising and throwing out their unjust owner in order to run the place themselves. It is a thinly-veiled jab at tyrannical regimes and succeeds tremendously. I breezed through this one and honestly could find nothing wrong with it. The characters are all believable and quite a few are even highly likable. My favorite is the horse Boxer who is renowned for his strength, both of body and character. You have to kind of suspend your disbelief when reading Animal Farm because of some of the things that happen, but it is well worth it. The animals decide that the humans get all of the benefit for their hard work and they are tired of it. Led by two pigs, Napoleon and Snowball, they overthrow the humans. I won't give a bunch of spoilers, but the story unfolds in such a way as to show how a dictatorship comes to be and how the animals went from one form of slavery to another. I also think the character Squealer was done extremely well as far a propaganda man(pig). By the end of the tale, you can see and understand everything that has transpired and the moral stands on its own without you needing to be bashed over the head with it. For a great fairy-tale about the dangers of socialism or any other kind of bad government ending with ""ism"", look no further than Animal Farm, where ""All animals are created equal, but some are more equal than others."""
Animal Farm,0452284244,George Orwell,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"Classic, he was way ahead of his time. Of course evil and lies lurk in our everyday lives. You can see the parallels in today's politics, a must read for everyone and keep your eyes open, freedom is not free-nothing is given to you without consequences read between the lines."
Animal Farm,0452284244,George Orwell,Barnes and Noble,4.2,penaaa,"Change can sometimes be good, but not in this case. At first glance, George Orwell's book ""Animal Farm"" might seem like a book for children but as I read the story, I began to realize it was based on the Russian Communist Revolution. It's purely political as well as fantasy, considering the characters are animals. George Orwell says ""it is the history of a revolution that went wrong"" and he was absolutely right. Leaders have a tendancy to get too comfortable with their authority and begin to take advantage of it. The novel explains the many things that can go wrong when someone decides it's time for a change.	""Animal Farm"" is the story of a group of animals living in a farm under human authority. Once manipulated into believing Mr. Jones is evil, as well as all the human race, the animals decide to rebel. They come up with seven commandments that they are expected to live by:1. Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy; 2. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend; 3. No animal shall wear clothes; 4. No animal shall sleep in a bed; 5. No animal shall drink alcohol; 6. No animal shall kill any other animal; 7. All animals are equal.The rules were set and they were final. They drive out the farmer and start to feel as if all authority is gone. Just as fast, the pigs decide they are the ones most fit to be in charge. Sure enough, authority begins to be abused and misused. The pigs treated the animals as if they were above and better than them. They started living in the farmers home, sleeping in the beds and there were even rumors of murder! The other animals were forced to work harder while the pigs sat around and did absolutely nothing. Everything was all too familiar but if you decided to speak up or go against the pigs, you were gone.	I could definitely recommend this book to others because it's very interesting and easy to comprehend. It illustrates manipulation at its worst. Before reading this book, I didn't care much for politics but after I realized everything that could go wrong, it motivated me to be aware of any leader's words and actions. It brought me to the realization that just because it sounds good doesn't always mean go with it because it's easy to be manipulated when the words they're speaking sound right. Change isn't always for the better, even if that's what they're telling you."
The Diary of a Young Girl,0553296981,"Anne Frank, Eleanor Roosevelt, B.M. Mooyaart-Doubleday",Barnes and Noble,4.4,mothman,"I love this book- at times I forgot that she was as young as she was, or that she wasn't even alive anymore. I felt like I new her, and she became a great friend of mine. It seemed to me that as she got more and more used to writing, it all seemed to come to her more and more naturally. 
There were some discussions- as innocent as they were- that she and Peter had near the end of the book. I found parts of it a bit awkward to read, seeing as she was so young and open about them, but as a kid myself I know it is a common occurrence in conversation. But, nevertheless, it was one of the few real diaries of the Holocaust that I have come across, and is also one of the best Holocaust books I have ever read. I honestly wish they would've survived and been able to marry. 
Every page holds some new meaning, or some new secret worry that Anne has to hide from everyone else.  And she was so truthful to her diary! She admitted her hopes and fears, and even her angers and faults. When she found her roommate had a secret stash of goods he kept from everyone, I could practically feel her outrage! She described that weird old man so well- he was such a creep! He was probably a weird old pervert, and I'm sorry that she had to room with him. 
I can totally get the mother-daughter fighting thing, though I probably didn't get as mad, and I can never hold a grudge. Anne was right to hold out and keep true to herself, even though it seems no one in the world is willing to do that anymore- but if you're already in hiding and being persecuted for your religion. that's the same thing as being persecuted for your beliefs! Letting go would've been like turning away from your religion, and everything that the Jews fighting for freedom stood for. 
In short- I really liked it, and I would recommend this to anyone, for any occasion. It was a wonderful read, and I will never, ever forget it. It's a shame she didn't live to write more, it really is. Five stars- please, please, please- go read it!"

Learn more about her story then you still dont have room to criticize her. What would you be acting like if you were in hiding for two years?  Yeah.

"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Millennium, #1)",0307269752,"Stieg Larsson, Reg Keeland",Barnes and Noble,4.1,onyxdragon,"I've seen some complaints that it is too slow.  To that I say, it's because of realism.  Having done some investigative reporting stuff myself, I can say that the pace at which it starts into its mystery is completely believable.  And the methods used as well.  Is it a little slow in the first half?  Yeah, but is that a bad thing?  No.  It's attention to detail and characterization, and a commitment to realism.  And that's nothing to complain about.

I've seen some opinions about the violence, and I didn't think it was overly graphic... nor without a point.  I can't stand graphic violence with little to no point.  But by the time you get to the end of the first book, at least for me anyway, I found myself fully appreciating his tackling this issue of violence against women in Sweden.  And I finally both fully understood and appreciated the statistics regarding crimes against women that were inserted at the beginning of each new Part of the book.  It seemed clear to me that Larrson wanted to let people know what life in Sweden can be like for a woman, and having no frame of reference to such before reading the book I found myself respecting Larrson for making this his main drive and theme of the story.

I don't know... I can't complain.  I think this is some of the best published writing I've read in a long time.  I was never bored or disinterested.  He kept me captivated from start to finish.

My only complaint is that it's a little more vulgar and perverse than I usually care for.  But even at that, he could have been much more perverse with as much promiscuity some of his characters indulged in; yet he often used the old school film method of setting the implication (or starting the process) and moving on to something else.  Something with plot, something with character.  Something we could care about.

I just need to get the second in the series now, so I can pick up where it left off.  OH, which reminds me, somebody said something about the end being a dud and that's said.  It's called leaving loose ends, because it's a series and you want to keep your readers with you.  If you resolve everything and walk away people won't come back--having been fully satisfied.  My only hope is that the third (and final book he completed) has some full resolve or that they finally let his life-long companion finish his fourth one--which he was working on when he died.

It really is a shame he left so early and that his works couldn't have been written and published earlier in life.  It's reported he had 10 books in the series in mind.  I guess we'll just have to make do with what he gave us."
"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Millennium, #1)",0307269752,"Stieg Larsson, Reg Keeland",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,Once you get through the first quarter of the book its awesome! I usually put books down if they dont have me hooked by the first 3 pages but I read reviews and knew that the beginning was a bit slow so I kept at it and I'm so glad I did! I just finished the last in the series (The Girl Who Kicked a Hornet's Nest) and I was on the edge of my seat with all 3 books!!!
"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Millennium, #1)",0307269752,"Stieg Larsson, Reg Keeland",Barnes and Noble,4.1,1Katherine1,"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is book is neither bloated nor overblown and it's absolutely wonderful that there are so many characters; it creates a rich reading experience. And besides, there is a family tree one can refer to. This book is highly interesting and engaging. I found that after the first couple of character introductory chapters that the mystery to be solved kept me wanting to keep reading! I enjoyed the complexity of the plot and enjoyed that Larsson takes his time and presents a story with depth. If you want a fast moving book filled with action this book isn't for you. But if you want a thoughtful book that deals with moral issues, has two very interestingly different protagonists (Blomkvist and Salander), has a humdinger of a mystery and yes, does have some intense action, then pick up a copy today!!"
"Catching Fire (The Hunger Games, #2)",0439023491,Suzanne Collins,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Fiddlesticks,"While considerably darker than The Hunger Games, Catching Fire was an immensely thrilling book. An indispensable quality of writing with a voice true to the character teamed with an overwhelming plot full of blood-curdling twists and heart-wrenching turns ensure Catching Fire a special home on my bookshelf. Catching Fire is most definitely the best YA novel to present itself to me in years. The ending does not merely leave you hanging precariously off the edge of your seat, but gives you the sensation of being shoved out of a moving plane. Quite frankly, I loved it."

"Catching Fire (The Hunger Games, #2)",0439023491,Suzanne Collins,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,I loved the first book so much I managed to get my hands on an ARC for Catching Fire.  I finished the book in one sitting and it is just as extraordinary as the first.  It picks up almost right where the first book leaves off with Katniss and Peeta's return home to District 12.  This book focuses less on the Games and more on the unrest that Peeta and Katniss' defiance of the Capitol has created throughout most of the Districts.  It is just as gut wrenching and heart breaking as the first.  The story is chilling and draws the reader into the harsh yet frighteningly realistic dystopian society of Panem.  Collins is a magnificent writer and I can't wait to read the third and final book!

"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Harry Potter, #3)",043965548X,"J.K. Rowling, Mary GrandPré, Rufus Beck",Barnes and Noble,4.7,Guest,"This book's title is excellent. It fits the   book but it doesn't make entirely perfect   sense until further in. However, like the   first two, getting absorbed in the story is   simple. After the first Harry Potter book,   which I started out reading because I wanted   to see if it was as good as everyone said, I   couldn't put it down. It was like escaping to   another world. I know that is probably an   overused phrase but it fits in this case. I   could get away from my stressful school life,   homework, siblings, and nice but sometimes   annoying friends, but also identify with the   characters. Harry's story is so wildly and   exotically different, yet so true for almost   everyone who has ever gone to school or had   an annoying family. Not only that but the   story is enthralling. What started out as   pleasure reading to 'get away' became a quest   to find out what would happen next with each   page of all three books. I started the first   book right after the second came out, and   finished the second a week after the third   came out. Now the rumor is that new additions   will be released once a year. The 7-book   series will be completed when I am 17. They   can't come out fast enough for me!!! The only   book I've read that tops these is 'The Last   Silk Dress' by Ann Rinaldi but it is not like   these books at all. I have varied tastes. I   hope you enjoy Harry Potter"

"The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)",0618346252,J.R.R. Tolkien,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,I first started reading The Lord of the Rings while in the military. I had a lot of time to pass and I'm so very glad I chose these books to pass it with. I absolutely loved the story and how J.R.R Tolkien constructs a world I could never have dreamed of on my own. His imagination and superb writing have gone on to inspire innumerable artists in today's culture. I must admit when the movies came out I was hesitant to watch them. I'm glad I did though because they did a very fine job of capturing the magic of the story. Of course there were things left out. The already long movies would have been epic tales that would last hours upon hours on film had everything been included. I highly recommend these books to anyone who wants to be taken away to another time and place where magic is alive and simpler things like home are treasured.
"The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)",0618346252,J.R.R. Tolkien,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"I thought that the book was great. You would be able to understand it if you are older than 6th grade. In the story Frodo, a hobbit, inherits a very powerful ring. Frodo and 3 other hobbits travel on a journey to Rivendell to find out what to do with the ring. There they decide that they have to destroy the ring once and for all. The fellowship must travel to the depths of Mount Doom and cast the ring into the fire. What I liked best about the book is that the hobbits aren't the fastest or the strongest of the fellowship, but they don't give up on each other. It is overall a great book that you should read."
"The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)",0618346252,J.R.R. Tolkien,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Guest,"The reason that I read this book is because I have always heard great things about this book and have seen all of its excellent movies and so far all of its reviews are well justified. In this book, the beginning of a great war in the land of Middle Earth is unfolding. I would not recommend reading this book until you have read the prelude to it called The Hobbit which describes the tale of  Bilbo Baggins. Now in The Lord of the Rings the fellowship of the Ring. It shows the discovering of the ring of power which was forged in secret by the dark lord Sauron and his sending of the nine ring wraiths to the peaceful land of the shire and Frodo Baggins and his fear full escape to the elf city of Rivendell with the ring wraiths on there tails ready to kill any that stood in there way. The final part I can say without ruining the book is in Rivendell under the wise council of the elf lord Elrond a ground of nine ( a elf, dwarf, 4 hobbits, and 2 men)set out on a almost completely hopeless quest to destroy the ring of power forever.                  The reason I enjoyed that book and I think you will too. Is because this book is described in the most brilliant detail and you can see everything unfold in your head, and the everlasting fantasy that you won't forget anytime soon."

"Mockingjay (The Hunger Games, #3)",0439023513,Suzanne Collins,Barnes and Noble,4.4,reader_girl94,"So, alot of people who have read this book were dissapointed by it. They expected more, it didn't live up to the hype, ect. ect. But I thought it was a great end to the trilogy. Katniss was in a state of mental unstability--but honestly, who wouldn't? She has gone through so much in the past two books and this one, that while she is SO strong, everyone has their breaking point and throughout the book Katniss was pushed to hers. She saw loved ones die and see the pain the Capitol put them through. The fact that by the end of the book she was still functioning is an accomplishment in my book.

As for the rest of the book it was filled with emotion and action. It was a bit fast paced and some things seemed to happen so fast and unclear, but besides that it was a truely amazing book. I recommend it to everyone and all Hunger Games fans."
"Mockingjay (The Hunger Games, #3)",0439023513,Suzanne Collins,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Nikkayme,"I finished Mockingjay just last night and having just re-read some of my favorite parts, I have to say that I'm feeling completely drained. Both mentally and emotionally. The closing book in the trilogy is a whirlwind of everything that made the previous two books brilliant, but this one holds a much more terrifying and foreboding tone.

Every twist, every surprise will tear you apart in some way. It's really difficult for me to describe it if you haven't read the book, but the characters go through hell and back here.

Where The Hunger Games introduced us to this world where children were forced to fight to the death and Catching Fire lit the spark of a rebellion, Mockingjay becomes a war zone. Happy endings are hard to come by and there is a massacre around every corner, making this book so much darker than the last two.

Instead of going into the war zone of an arena, we are catapulted into a real war zone with bombs, gunfire, and death. The politics of it all leaves us unable to trust anything we learn. Everyone has motives for doing what they are doing, but it's a matter of figuring just what is right that is the most difficult part. All this leads to so much inner turmoil for Katniss and a box of Kleenex may be needed to make it to the end. I know I was tearing up every few chapters.

Many characters face obstacles that we could never imagine and minor characters take on roles we could only have hoped for. The lies, deceit, hatred, anguish, despair, heartache, joy, and even hope take their toll. There were a few times when I just had to take a break and pull myself together because the book was just wiping me out. The death, the carnage, and the emotional upheaval are a lot to take. Collins never lets us forget that we are in a war zone with Katniss and in war, there are no winners. Fighting a war is not easy and there will be casualties and consequences, lives lost and lives destroyed.

The war zone mentality detracts from the Team Peeta/Team Gale atmosphere that lingered in the last two books, but the relationship between Peeta/Katniss/Gale is still explored with insurmountable care and delicacy. With all that has happened, one can only hope that all of them can find some sort of peace.

Suzanne Collins did something special with this series. Not only is the world of THG absolutely captivating, it is thought-provoking and emotional. Mockingjay is a heart-wrenching finale that will leave readers thinking about it long after turning that final page. The rollercoaster ride of emotions left me drained from the intensity of a world where a girl lit the spark that ignited a nation.

Without giving any spoilers away, I will state that although (as always) Harry's struggles are increasing, so are his friendships and relationships deepening. If you ever feared the Harry Potter books were too kid-ish for you, this book will cure you of that fear. Harry is growing up, and so are our reader's expectations for him.

I am 21 years old,   so being freshly out of high school back   then, I didn't want to read anything, (after   the silliness one must endure during that   time). But  J. K. Rowlin tells a story about   an unfortunate little boy, in an   extraordinary way; written so that even 6   year-olds can enjoy it. This story, the  way is it written and how it unfolds, is   trully compellingly told and genuinely   delighful.   As things unveill, they do so with such   care for details, and does not insult one's   intelligence. It makes you fell as if you are   with this boy, along the way cheering him   on and comforting him when he needs it.  Lastly, the author writes with a humourus    undertone (even more so than  many so-called comedies out there), that    it makes you laught  with the book, not at   it."

As I began to read it more and more, not only did I like it, but I began to be so attached to the story and especially the characters, which the author ,Alice Sebold, writes about in great detail. The story is about a 13 year old girl named Susie Salmon who has a normal, but nice life. Her life is soon put to an end though once she is murdered by one of her neighbors. She than goes off to heaven and looks down on her murderer and on her coping family. Alice Sebold has made an imaginative story which has a wonderfully set up plot that features suspense, romance, some mystery, tragedy, and hope. The Lovely Bones is a book that I think everybody of all ages and gender should read."
The Lovely Bones,0316166685,Alice Sebold,Barnes and Noble,4.1,saffie90,"I'm 13 years old but read at a very high reading level. This book, to me, was absolutely amazing. I will never forget it. The plot was amazing, the story line great. The emotion Alice Sebold puts into the book is literal, yet touching. A girl murdered tells the story of her life, then watches her family grow, have problems, and become better people from heaven. She watches the murderer of herself cover up his path. She watches her sister grow up. It's all very heartbreaking, yet very amazing. Truly a must-read."

The story is very absorbing, and I like the addition of many new characters in the book.  Rowling gives us a glimpse further into the world of wizardry with the integration of the other magic schools.  In my opinion, a very interesting read, with many twists and turns not seen in any of the Harry Potter books earlier in the series.  I can read it over and over again and not get tired of it.  I love it!"

Rowling is about a young wizard tryin to complete his training at Hogwarts School, of witchcraft and wizardry. After seeing the movie and reading the book I noticed that J.K. Rowling and the director had different interpretations on some of the ways the story went.          Harry Potter is midway through both his training as a wizard and his coming of age. Harry wants to leave the Dursleys home, to venture to be part of the famous Quidditch World Cup with his friends Ron and Hermione. He attends, but something strange happens at the World Cup. Will Harry overcome this? After his adventure Harry returns to Hogwarts to find out that the famous Tri-Wizard Tournament is held at Hogwarts. During the Tournament Harry a young 4th year student must overcome certain obstacles like learning new spells, dealing with people such as Malfoy, and asking his crush to the dance before anyone else does.

Harry Potter's final saga 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows' had been set upon the world. I dare say that no one will be disappointed. Harry's final adventure is a remarkable journey into the world of fantasy. The wedding of Fleur and Bill as it ends  in chaos. The escape of our trio from the death eaters and that is only the beginning. And the many subsequent adventures. Finally ending with the final battle at Hogwarts and the defeat of Voldamort by Harry. An adventure froth with danger, fears, laughter, doubts and narrow excapes will have its readers on the edge of their seat. I was!"
"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Harry Potter, #7)",0545010225,"J.K. Rowling, Mary GrandPré",Barnes and Noble,4.7,NS50,"The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. This is the tone of J. K. Rowling's last book, a gripping story in which Harry Potter and his friends go through terrible struggles throughout their quest to destroy death, in the form of Voldemort.  He is a cruel evil wizard that would kill anyone in his way to get what he wants. The book leaves every question answered.  This book will be the best fantasy adventure book that you have ever read.  This is the classic tale of good versus evil. The major conflict is the battle for a better world without evil. 
The 3 protagonists include Harry, Ron Weasly, and Hermione Granger.  Ron is Harry's best friend that he met in his first year on the Hogwarts express and has stuck by him through thick and thin. Ron brings comic relief and the intrigue of romance, as he competes for the affection of Hermione.  Hermione is also Harry's friend who also met him on the Hogwarts express and has always stuck up for harry and helps him figure out every problem. Hermione is the real brains of the outfit, and knows what she's doing at all times. As for Harry himself, he is the complete hero:  puzzler, brave, true friend, and honorable person. He's the heart and muscle, who brings hope to everyone around the world. Just as every Batman has his Joker, Harry is confronted on all sides, and sometimes from within. Together they are like the Three Musketeers! Or like Ocean's 11, they are Harry's 3.  
The setting is the unimaginable world of wizardry, where everything is a surprise but following the invisible logic of magic. J.K. Rowling's style is both clever and mysterious. She'll draw you in with charm and leave you wondering what happened pages later.  Rowling likes to leave clues for us to try to figure things out.  Her pages are packed full of big visual descriptions of the atmosphere, the mood, the setting, and all the different creatures. The only thing that let me down about this story was the simple fact that it ended!
If you came looking for complex characters and mysterious plot twists, then this is the book for you. If not, then go grab yourself a copy of People magazine and go crazy! This is Rowling's Book 7, the last of the series that wraps-up all the questions about what you thought you knew about Harry. She has taken our connection to Harry beyond what we have imagined.  My final recommendation to Potter fans and critics is a big ""two thumbs up."" This book is for anyone to read at all ages and it will want to make you keep on reading until the very end.  It looks like the end of the road for Harry, or is it?"

"The Da Vinci Code (Robert Langdon, #2)",0307277674,Dan Brown,Barnes and Noble,4.3,sbux06,"There's nothing more I like about a book than its ability to make me want to keep reading and reading. Honestly, there was no good stopping point. I would stop then quickly skim the first line of the next chapter and before I know it, I've read into two more chapters. Very entertaining and enjoyable from beginning to end. Loved it!"
"The Da Vinci Code (Robert Langdon, #2)",0307277674,Dan Brown,Barnes and Noble,4.3,kpopluvr18,"To be honest, reading a book in my free time never hit the top of my ""to do"" list.  The DaVinci Code by Dan Brown made me want to read more.  From this one book, I realized that Dan Brown could transport you to the world of the Holy Grail.

The way the book flowed made it seem like the story took place over a few days.  In reality, Dan Brown has written a 489-page book over the course of 24 hours.

Honestly, there weren't many times when I could say, ""I should stop reading if I want to get enough sleep.""  Every page was filled with action-packed scenes, puzzles, and interesting insights.

There were some things I didn't like about the book, however.  Throughout the book, Dan Brown used French words in the dialogue.  He doesn't include a glossary--well, not in the paperback edition, at least--and sometimes I have to skip over the French words or use my imagination to figure out what they mean.  Also, the descriptions of the Louvre, for instance, seem like they come out of a travel brochure.  Honestly, I didn't need to know every single detail of the Louvre because I saw it on the Internet before. 

You should read The DaVinci Code if you have an interest in codes and puzzles, conspiracies, and mystery.  Dan Brown does an excellent job of explaining his ideas, up to the point where a teenager can understand.  This is what I like about Dan Brown.  He is able to captivate his audience with controversial topics while reminding us that his books are fiction.

I highly recommend this book to people of all ages, and I hope that you'll enjoy this book as much as I did."
"The Da Vinci Code (Robert Langdon, #2)",0307277674,Dan Brown,Barnes and Noble,4.3,bookdork89,"When I took the decision of sitting down and read the book it was because of the high recommendations that it had received from all my friends and teachers. I myself am not much of a reader, but as soon as I started reading the book I just couldn't let go of it. After reading this book I can certainly say that Dan Brown is a true genius.
The Da Vinci code is a masterpiece. It's one of those books that are unique and that are always going to be a must read. It starts out with a murder case, but it isn't your typical case of finding out who it is, Dan Brown is sure of leaving more than evidence towards the true secret behind this murder case that has more behind it than just a guilty assassin. I assure you that throughout the whole journey that the protagonist Robert Langdon and Sophie Nevue undergo you will feel the tension and the passion for finding out the secret that Da Vinci has left for us. You will feel nervous, you will feel sad and disappointed when you can't find out the secret and you will utter satisfaction, you will end up with an open mouth. It has all the characteristics of a mystery/adventure novel that will make you enjoy this book as if you're Robert of Sophie themselves. I'm certain that you won't be able to think about anything else when you're not reading the book. Besides all this incredible characteristics it also has a small dose of love between the 2 main characters, that throughout the whole book you can see the obvious chemistry that exist between them.
So for all those readers who like the unexpected, this is your book, when you're sure that that's the guy, or that they have solved the mystery, I assure you, you will be wrong, the truth will blow your mind. One of the things that I most enjoyed was the fact that several things were happening at the same time with different characters, the author gives you just the amount of information about what's happening with one character to leave you hooked, and then will go and tell you in the next chapter what's  happening with the other characters and ALSO LEAVE YOU HOOKED! so you won't be able to stop reading you will read faster and faster, holding your breath to the sudden twists the book takes, and be breathless by the end of it. Although Dan Brown's literature as a whole may not be very good, it is apt for many ages and great to be read as a fictional fun book that will leave you with a sweet taste of mouth. When finishing the Da Vinci code you will want to read more of Dan Brown, The Da Vinci Code is an amazing book and I dare rate it without a doubt a 5 star book. What's great about Dan Brown is that he doesn't stop his masterpiece here he continues his extravagant writing in books like Angels and Demons, Digital Fortress, and Deception point, so I can say without a doubt that Dan Brown is one of top authors of this age with a creativity that is worth being turned into a book."

"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Harry Potter, #6)",0439785960,"J.K. Rowling, Mary GrandPré",Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, by J.K. Rowling, is another incredible account on the life of Harry Potter. Entering his sixth year at the acclaimed school of witchcraft and wizardry, Hogwarts, Harry is faced with an even tougher set of tasks than ever before. Throughout the year, Dumbeldore calls upon him occasionally for some ""private lessons"", but Harry soon finds out that these lessons are not for practicing his magic. No, Dumbeldore calls upon Harry to once again delve into the Pensieve, and explore the many memories people have of a younger Tom Marvolo Riddle, or Lord Voldemort. The reason Dumbeldore is doing this is because he believes he has found the secret to Voldemort's power: Horcruxes, and the only way they will be able to find the horcruxes is to find objects that Voldemort was very attached to. Horcruxes are a very dangerous and dark type of magic in which one slices up his/her soul and hides it in objects, so even when they die, they aren't really dead until ALL of their soul is destroyed. Dumbeldore believes that he has found one of Voldemort's horcruxes and wants Harry to come and help him destroy it.
I give this book 5out of 5 stars because I believe this is a book in which many teenagers and even adults can relate. Rowling, including the other five books in the series, creates an imaginative world, but that relates to society today, which is why they are all so popular. Rowling assembles her characters so that many different types of children can relate to them. For example, Ron is struggling with his hormones and is continually ""snogging"" with his newfound girlfriend Lavender, but isn't really sure about the whole relationship thing. Now many teenage boys (or girls) can definitely relate to this! Most boys aren't sure what the heck they feel and go with their first instinct: to get a girlfriend no matter what. This relation to the real world, and many others, is part of the reason why I love these books and why so many others do as well.
The last reason (but not the only reasons) I give this book 5 out of 5 stars is because of the intense suspense and just how well the book is written. Just like every other Harry Potter, every single page leaves you begging you for more. Personally, I'd just read these books for hours on end if I could. Rowling ends every chapter in a way that you can't just put it down and stop reading for the day: you HAVE to keep reading. The plot in this Harry Potter is incredibly thought out, super exciting, but surprisingly simple, which I think is why many people read it so often. It is not difficult to understand at all but the imagination Rowling put into writing is (and all the others) is astonishing. 
In conclusion, I give this book 5 out of 5 stars and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for an amazing book to read. This is my favorite series of books EVER and this is my 2nd favorite one in the series, next to Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire."

Lord of the Flies,0140283331,William Golding,Barnes and Noble,3.8,SucksToYourAsmar,"I was assigned to read this book for school and I read the entire thing cover to cover in a few hours. It's an amazing and consuming story that shows how people can be innately good or evil.It dives into the human psyche and unrivels the tangled knot that is the mind. It also envolpes the religous scope of man, Simon as a Christ character and the pigs head as Beelzebub,great. I do admit dialogue is hard to follow but if you take the time to look past that it's amazing! One of the best books I have ever read!!"

The novel takes place on an island were young boys are plane wrecked and have to figure out how to survive with no parents. Starting out civilized, they quickly progress into savagery. While everything is falling apart Golding uses characters and items found on the island to represent symbols all throughout the book. I recommend reading lord of the flies, it is a great novel full of symbolism and it gives you a different view of how life could be with no rules."

This tale was so engrossing that I finished it that same Saturday.The reason this book was so captivating was Golding's carefully woven tale of wonder and brutality. Not only is Lord of the Flies an allegory, but it is also a tale where we are forced to confront the utterly shocking extremes of human nature.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a challenging and frightening, yet extremely enjoyable read. Here's to hoping that I never get stranded on an island with adolescent British boys!"
Romeo and Juliet,0743477111,"William Shakespeare, Robert           Jackson",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"My class at school just finished a quarter unit on this book/play. Like everyone in my class ended up loving it, although when I first saw it on the syllabus, I groaned and thought ""Great, we have to read Romeo and Juliet."" I liked it especially the quick, sarcastic and witty dialouge, and paraphrasing. You have to be good at that in order to read this, or NONE of it will make sense at ALL. We also watched the 1968 movie version (don't watch the new one-it's awful). My favorite character in the play was Mercutio!!! he was funny."

Gone Girl,0297859382,Gillian Flynn,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Anonymous,"For those Anonymous users that gave this one star without any text explaining that low rating...you suck. And you make the rest of us that want to remain anonymous look bad.

This is a smart, clever thriller that dissects the marriage of Amy and Nick Dunne. It's a dark, twisted story that will leave you shocked. (At least, I was shocked...and I can't stop talking about how much I loved it.)

I should mention, I didn't like Flynn's first novel, I only picked this one up because I only heard good things from people I trust."
Gone Girl,0297859382,Gillian Flynn,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Anonymous,"I refuse to summarize this story. I believe this is a fantastic book that should be relished without any prior knowledge of its plot.  Wonderful prose. Insightful observations. Great character development. There are so many comments I would like to make, but I would ruin the suspense for others. I was/am so emotionally charged at the ending that I want to become a character in the story.  Without spoiling the plot for those who chose to enjoy this incredible book, I suspect that many readers will have a similar reaction and would like to join me as residents of Carthage, Missouri."
Gone Girl,0297859382,Gillian Flynn,Barnes and Noble,3.8,MrsRedditAll,"I read...a lot.  Like, I need to read.  After reading &quot;Gone Girl,&quot; I know why. Very seldom will you come across a book that finishes so well. The story keeps you reading...so many stories can do that. This one, however, does what so few can accomplish by ending well. Satisying, is the best word I can think of. I realized I keep looking for a book that will satisfy all my cravings in a good story: suspense, humor, anger, sadness, relief.  A fine book doesn't have to leave you guessing throughout the plot to keep you wanting more.  Flynn keeps it straight to the point with enough twists to make it twisted without becoming too complicated to follow. 
This book will grab you like a hyped-up media headline and won't let you go! We all get caught up in the mainstream, bombshell news casts, and this book takes you right there in the middle of it.  Love the technique and can't wait to see what Gillian Flynn comes up with next!"
The Help,0399155341,Kathryn Stockett,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Tarasview,I absolutely LOVED this book. Kathryn Stockett did an amazing job. I loved how the story was written from the perspectives of the different women. I enjoyed seeing the world through their very different eyes and watching them develop throughout the story. The beautifully descriptive writing drew me in and made me feel like I was right there. This is an intense story of how these different women deal with the issue of racism during the civil rights movement. It is a poignant and deeply moving novel. I didn't want the book to end. I think this book would make an amazing movie as well. I would highly recommend this book to everyone.

Memphis, where I grew up, was where the Delta began, and she described that world perfectly -- the maids in their uniforms, the restrictions, the distrust. I couldn't put it down, but then I was sorry when I finished because I wanted to read more about Skeeter and Minny and all the others. I hope she writes a sequel."
Of Mice and Men,0142000671,John Steinbeck,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Bran,"This book is an instant classic in my eyes and will never die down because this is a book that can keep anybody of any age and of any IQ reading it over and over, i know it did that to me. this is one book i would always want to have around because its a short read ( 100 or so pages ) that will captivate you in many ways."
Of Mice and Men,0142000671,John Steinbeck,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"Set in the 1930s, John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men depicts the nomadic lives of George Milton and Lennie Small. The two men travel together, but are as different as can be. George is a small, intelligent man, while Lennie is an incredibly large man with the intellect of a child. Though the two are complete opposites, they are each other's family. This tale encompasses the thematic ideas of everlasting friendship as well as the unreachable American Dream. Steinbeck is able to integrate these topics brilliantly into a single novel, one that the reader will not put down until it is completed. The timeless themes within this book and the way they are presented are what truly sets it apart from any other clich&#233; Western novel. Not only do George and Lennie, the protagonists of the novel, seek an undying friendship, but the other men working on the ranch, long for that same companionship. They all crave the brotherhood that results in fidelity to one another and an unspoken bond that can never be broken. Steinbeck flawlessly portrays his characters as they search for this ideal friendship. The author also successfully illustrates the unfeasibility of the American Dream. The reader is made aware throughout the book that almost every character has once envisioned themselves living an alternate life; one filled with absolute contentment and complete serenity. The fact that not a single character has attained their dream shows that the idealized American Dream is impossible to truly achieve. John Steinbeck does a phenomenal job in displaying the ambition and certainty that the characters possessed towards reaching their variation of the Dream, as well as the hopelessness and gloom they experience upon realizing the impossibility of it. The desires that John Steinbeck so eloquently incorporates into Of Mice and Men are timeless and easily relatable. Any reader can feel instantly connected to the characters and their struggles. This remarkable novel leaves the reader utterly captivated and with a sense that hopes and dreams may not be all that you can count on to get you through in life."
Of Mice and Men,0142000671,John Steinbeck,Barnes and Noble,4.2,WalruzFlatz,"I had to read this book for my tenth grade English class. Generally I do not like stories that take place back in the day. However, I LOVED this novel. Maybe it was because it is so well known around the world. John Steinbeck created such amazing characters, and the events that occurred always kept me at the edge of my seat. I hated when the bell rang because I knew I would have to wait until the next day in class to see what would happen. Everyone should read this at some point. The movie was just as great, also!"
Memoirs of a Geisha,0739326228,Arthur Golden,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,This book was amazing and a beautiful read. It felt like Chiyo and Sayuri were right next to me telling the story of their lives. Beautifullly witten. This book engulfs the reader in its own world and even the most relunctant readers will find that they can't put this book down. I told my friend who only read a book once in a while and she finished the book in about 4 days. The story pulls your heart strings and you will hold your breath to find out what happens next. It is one of those books that when you hear its name again you immediately smile and say what a good book it was. You'll find yourself reccommending it to all your friends and family.
Memoirs of a Geisha,0739326228,Arthur Golden,Barnes and Noble,4.6,StacieRosePittard,"I first want to address a couple reviews I read before I purchased Memoirs of a Geisha, because I very nearly skipped this novel due to the content of these reviews. People were offended by the sexual content in this novel, and some even said that the author gave the impression that Geisha were more sexual than they really are.

I disagree. Yes, there is a bit of sexual content, but it is in no way overwhelming, nor does it mislead readers to believe that Geisha are the same as prostitutes. If anything, the author of this book does a fantastic job of describing the art of the Geisha. I learned quite a bit about Geisha, and what they really do. I've always heard some people insist that a Geisha's job had nothing to do with sex, while others say that Geisha were no different from prostitutes. Both are wrong, and this book does a fantastic job of clarifying that balance. On top of that, it paints a wonderful picture of both the darker and brighter sides of a Geisha's life. It's not pure oppression, while at the same time it's not all rainbows and butterflies. I love that the author was honest in this portrayal, and kept his writing very respectful and open about a Geisha's life style.

And finally, it was simply an interesting story. The characters were well developed and interesting to follow, and I found myself deeply connected to their experiences. It's a wonderful novel I highly recommend."
Memoirs of a Geisha,0739326228,Arthur Golden,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,I adore the film adaptation but it's like looking at the reflection of a flower compared to the tragic loveliness the novel portrays. While there are some cultural innacuracies that a concientious reader would do well to research (the very misunderstood mizuage ceremony specifically) it tells a simple and sad but ultimately peaceful story. If you liked the film you will love this even more!

And yes it was a fast and easy read. So for entertainment factor I give it 2 stars. HOWEVER, do not be fooled...I would NOT consider this well written, nor is this close to the best book I've ever read. One of the other reviewers mentioned phrases repeated over and over again, and I couldn't agree more. At multiple points, it was as if the story was moving in circles. Sex scene after sex scene...which as you can imagine will keep you reading! So, if you are looking for a mindless romance novel full of descriptive sex scenes.... this is your book. But if you're looking for good literature with depth of characters and story...move on."

The characters are pithy and stereotyped.  Uggh, don't waste your time or money.  And there are two more to come?  I am fearful that so many people seem to think this is a great book. :("
"Fifty Shades of Grey (Fifty Shades, #1)",1612130291,E.L. James,Barnes and Noble,3.9,a_shipman,"I have never felt so passionate about writing a book review. Before choosing to dive into these books myself, I read hundreds of reviews. These reviews left me unsure about spending the $30 to read the trilogy. I can't express how glad I am that I did. There are a few important points I want to make: So many of the bad reviews consist of comments regarding the repetitive use of words or phrases such as ""inner goddess"" or ""beguile."" Come on now, who cares? Other reviews bluntly call this ""PORN."" I could not disagree more. Does EL James use the same word twice in a sentence? Does she use the phrase ""inner goddess"" multiple times throughout the works? Did I have to use my dictionary and/or thesaurus countless times while reading the series? The answer to all of those questions is YES. However, when reading, are these the sorts of things readers should really be focused on? My answer to that question is NO. So what if I had to use my thesaurus? So what if Ana and Christian talk differently than most of my American friends in some conversations? This was a beautiful piece of fiction. Rather than nagging about the fact that I had to look up several words, I saw it as an opportunity to expand my vocabulary, which I absolutely did. Now onto the fact that some people consider these books ""PORN."" That's absurd. Are there countless sexual encounters, most of them very graphic? Yes. Firstly, when you go to read these books, you are likely well aware of these facts. So, don't complain about it AFTER you read them. Secondly, I do not practice, nor do I know much about the BDSM sexual lifestyle. However, I feel that the BDSM lifestyle is essential to the story of Christian Grey. So are the numerous sexual encounters. The sex and the BDSM aspect play an important role in the story. Without it, the GROWTH of the characters would not be as evident. Christian is a troubled man with a disturbing past, which has led him to choose this type of lifestyle. However, Ana saves him. And, that is what makes this such a beautiful love story... Not to mention, the beginning of most new, steamy relationships does consist of a lot of sex. It's reality for most people. Here's another thing most reviews don't mention: These books are LAUGH OUT LOUD funny! The email exchanges between Ana and Christian had me giggling nonstop. In addition to giving me the giggles, the characteris in this story also warmed my heart, scared me to death, made me furious, and even made me cry. This trilogy has it all! My advice: ignore the bad reviews; ignore the repetition of some words and phrases throughout the book; look past all the sex. See what this story TRULY is: a BEAUTIFUL love story that is the perfect example of how love can change even the darkest of souls. I will certainly be reading the future works of EL James. The Fifty Shades Trilogy is by far my favorite series to date. If I could give 10 stars, I certainly would. READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
The Alchemist,0061122416,"Paulo Coelho, Alan R. Clarke",Barnes and Noble,4.2,pucketth,"Although I feel that previous reviews will make mine look incompetent and childish, i still feel like putting my two cents in.  This novel portrays Coelho's view on the meaning of life, that everyone has a preset dream and destination, but it is their choice to take the journey or not. Paul tells his story by using a shepherd boy that decides to follow his path to get to his destiny. the shepherd, Santiago, meets several people that open his eyes and show him why he has decided to do this.
What I liked about this book was the great imagery Coelho uses throughout the novel. Also, I love that this book is different than any others I have read. It takes you on a journey, not an adventure to slowly get the author's point across. You will feel yourself getting smarter and more adventurous as you read this book.
What i disliked about this book was that it is slow at points and gets a little monotonous, but if you keep pushing, it will all be well it. 
I am only 14 and I have read this book 2 times. It makes you want to make sure you don't hold back in your life, that you achieve something amazing. Forget about the normal way of life. I would recommend this book to anyone who is willing to read a book that will question the way you are living and will make you want to drop everything and go find your alchemist."
The Alchemist,0061122416,"Paulo Coelho, Alan R. Clarke",Barnes and Noble,4.2,OldBob,"As I get older, it seems I discover more about life. I'm 70 now. This is a book I wish I read years ago. You will learn things that I did and did not in this book, all of which will help you find your way through life. It is a great read too. Fun, hard to put down. Wonderful."
The Alchemist,0061122416,"Paulo Coelho, Alan R. Clarke",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"Seems like it would be a quick read, but it's a book that you should take some time with.

"The Giver (The Giver, #1)",0385732554,Lois Lowry,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"I read this book the first time in high school and have reread it a hundred times since.  After losing my copy during a move, i decided I had to replace it.  After reading it again, I remember why it's such an incredible story.  it makes you question yourself, your career, society and think of things in a different perspective.  the writing is superb and you get sucked in from the very beginning.  it's a page turner, even after having read it many times before.  as i mentioned in the title, it's one of my favorite books of all time.  i highly recommend it to anyone who likes to read something that makes them think.  A must read for everyone!"
"The Giver (The Giver, #1)",0385732554,Lois Lowry,Barnes and Noble,4.3,John_117,"The Giver is a fantastic novel well deserving of the Newberry Award. It is the story of a post apocalyptic world that on the surface is perfect. Everyone has a job and a meaningful purpose, there is no crime, no poverty, no hunger. All of the problems of our current world are no more. But things aren't as perfect they seem. In this world you are given your job assigned to you by the Elders during the ceremony of twelves. It is during this ceremony that Jonas is given the job of the Receiver, the most honored job in the community. Being given memories of a much different world by the Giver, Jonas begins to question the perfection of the community and it is here that the story begins to unfold. Angered and confused by his imperfect and very intriguing past, Jonas must save himself and his community from the fantasy life that has been thrust upon them.

I love this book for the simple fact that it poses questions that we never think about. What freedoms would give up if to have a perfect society? How important is individualism? What is the most valuable gift in life?  Once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down. I kept reading to find out what Jonas was going to do but I won't spoil the ending for you. You'll just have to read to find out.

If you're into wizards or galactic star fights this isn't the book for you. But if you enjoy a thought provoking book full of profound questions then this is the novel for you."
"The Giver (The Giver, #1)",0385732554,Lois Lowry,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"The Giver was an interesting novel that gave off many emotions. Joy, anger, horror, anguish, love, and desire were just a few of the many emotions the reader will dig up during their read. I did not understand the book at first. However, in the end, everything came together like a puzzle, and I could comprehend it.I do not recommend this book for anyone below thirteen. It has very disturbing points that the main character, Jonas, must go through. He must test his courage, strength, and heart in this story. These events cause unbelievable tension and terror, but, to a teenager or adult, this book would be a very good read. I believe The Giver shows us what we could do to ourselves in the future. We want to fit in so badly, that ¿Sameness¿ could become a real thing. It teaches us that our individuality is dangerous, but, at the same time, it allows us who we are. In the end, I did enjoy the novel and recommend it to my fellow readers. It was well written and was written to provide shocking moments for the reader."

Although the first chapter is a little boring, once you read the second chapter you won't be able to put it down. This book was written by an author (C.S. Lewis) from England, so there will be a few unfamiliar words if your not from that area. This book is #2 of the series, but if you go by the order that they were written this book would be the first. There is a total of seven books in the series. These books are The Magician's Nephew, The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, The Horse and His Boy, Prince Caspian, The Voyage of The Dawn Treader, The Silver Chair, and The Last Battle.

"A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, #1)",0553588486,George R.R. Martin,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Sutinike,"Martin has created a masterpiece with this series.

Never have I read any novel of any genre with so many characters, all so brilliantly lifelike, believable and richly detailed. He doesn't introduce them too quickly, giving the reader time to get to know and love them, and as soon as a side is chosen, he takes us into the world of the opposing characters, and we come to love them equally!

The scope of the series is truly epic, and while this is technically fantasy, the reader may forget that it's not historical fiction! The style is so gritty and unforgiving that one has no choice but to believe. The fantastical elements creep in slowly and undeniably - a skeleton in a closet, terrifying and mostly unseen.

With character drama like this, you don't have to be a fantasy buff to love this series. All who like sweeping drama will enjoy this fantastic journey."
"A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, #1)",0553588486,George R.R. Martin,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Elantraboi,"While I am fan of sci-fi and fantasy, I had never read anything by George R.R. Martin.  I was scolded for this oversight by many of co-workers and friends.  I finally gave in this past month and have been converted to a fan.

Be warned, ""A Game of Thrones"" is not for the casual fantasy reader.  It is deeply intricate and rich.  While Martin focuses each of the chapters on roughly ten main characters, there are well over fifty full realized characters in just the first book of this series.  It would be very easy to get confused or frustrated in the early pages of the tome, but to do so would be to lose out on the epic second half of the book.  Up until the last one hundred pages, I was still on the fence about this ""game of thrones.""  Now, having finsihed it, I can't wait to move on to the next book.

As a standalone book, I would not reccomend it; as the beginning of an epic series, I am totally hooked."
"A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, #1)",0553588486,George R.R. Martin,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"This is as good as the Fantasy genre can get.  I've read dozens of fantasy books by dozens of authors and this is simply the very best series I've ever read.  It stands head and shoulders above Lord of the Rings or really anything else I can imagine.  ---  The characters come completely to life.  The author conveys a sense of reality to each person in his story.  There aren't just 'good' guys and 'bad' guys as there are in the plethora of other highly rated fantasy series 'LotR, Dragonlance, Savadore books et. al.'.  Instead, each character has their strengths and their weaknesses.  Their noble redeeming qualities and their inner demons and selfishness.  In essence...they're human!  It sounds simple, but surprisingly not very many authors can accomplish this feat as well as Mr. Martin has been able to.  He does a brilliant job of making each of the characters unique and detailed in their personality and mannerisms.---    The story line is brilliant and kept me interested throughout the series.  This is possibly the fastest I've read through a book.---    Another thing...this book is not for children.  There's no Bimbldee-goo Gobleshanks or Dimpledink Fumplesnaps B.S. kiddie stuff like Tolkien.  There is no 'good guy' to root for, only different people of different kingdoms.  And sometimes the person you might peg as a 'good guy' may not 'win.'  The subject matter at times can be quite mature and maintains a high level of maturity throughout.---    So, although there are countless other rave reviews for this book, I figured I'd contribute anyhow.  Believe the hype, and don't believe the naysayers.  If you enjoy medieval fantasy 'not high fantasy, there aren't goblins and elves in this book' with an in depth and very realistic storyline get this book now.---"
"Eat, Pray, Love",0143038419,Elizabeth Gilbert,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Anonymous,"This was the most irritating book I have come across in quite some time. I honestly fail to understand what all the fuss is about.  The character is rich, self-absorbed, and narcissistic.  Yeah she was suffering, my heart bleeds for someone who has the money to traipse all over the world to find herself finally lighting in paradise where she meets a rich handsome man. Give me a break, and take a reality check.  It says much for our culture that the movie should be such a success, and that the book is a best seller. Honestly, the writing is not that great and the character .well what can I say?  More New Age dribble and easy answers except that in this case she has the financial wherewithal to travel the world to find herself.  Give us all a break."
"Eat, Pray, Love",0143038419,Elizabeth Gilbert,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,"A friend recomended this book to me after I had gone through divorce and then been diagnosed with cancer thinking I would find some wisdom within these pages.    However, what I found was an incredibly narcissistic writer/character. I kept waiting for her to suddenly stop in the middle of it all and just declare how self absorbed she is and then begin a real and truly honest self examination that would impart some valuable wisdom. Instead, she uses cliche riddled writing to avoid all of the hard subjects and not really be honest with the reader.    I can very much relate to her feelings of anxiety and stress as the result of her divorce, but she spends only a few pages on this and avoids providing the reader with any kind of an honest and real examination as to why her relationship failed, what she learned from it or what love means to her. After reading more about her as a writer she seems like a very talented and intellectually curious person, but none of that comes through in this book. All that the reader sees is someone who is very lucky, but doesn't really seem to appreciate it.    When she writes that she was not saved by her prince -- surprise, surprise she meets a good looking, intelligent man at the end -- but that she saved herself, I had to ask, 'From what?' It certainly wasn't extraordinary narcisism.    In the end, all I learned is that the author is a really lucky person."
"Eat, Pray, Love",0143038419,Elizabeth Gilbert,Barnes and Noble,3.7,EmilySwallows,"As a English professor at a university in San Diego, many of my students complain that I don't teach many ""happy"" books.  A few of them recommended this book to me.  And I'm glad they did...this is a troubling book.

The most troubling thing about this vapid text isn't the fact that Gilbert is an annoying person; no, most troubling is the fact that so many people here are identifying with the narrator's ""search.""  Really?  You identify with an upitty, wealthy, New England divorcee who got paid to travel and ""find"" herself?  From the faux-philosophical ruminations on ""God,"" to the juvenile talk of Italian men (""I like kissing""--no joke--she really got paid to write that), Gilbert attempts to convince you that she's intellectual, spiritual, and--somehow--had a tough life.

Gilbert tells us in the first chapter that she's not going to go into why her marriage broke apart (though she admits that much of it was her fault), but then details numerous faults with her husband (his biggest fault?  He wanted her to have--gasp!--children!).  The disingenuousness of Gilbert knows no limits!  She tells us early on that she ""got rid of all her possessions.""  How noble, right?  Well, not really, she just put them into storage.  How serendipitous! 

At all times, Gilbert's vapid self-centered ""wanderer"" takes center stage. Gilbert takes an entire sentence(!) to walk through a Roman neighborhood used as a Jewish Ghetto in WWII, and promptly discards that invitation to measure her own struggles against true adversity in favor of saying how she likes to visit the Pantheon.

If you'd like to read a sincere look at personal struggle, please read Jhumpa Lahiri's ""Unaccustomed Earth"" or Louise Errich's ""Plague of Doves."""
"The Lightning Thief (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, #1)",0786838655,Rick Riordan,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Guest,My 9-year-old son chose this book mainly for the cool 'scary' cover.  I had scanned through it and warned him that it had a lot of mythology in it and might be tough to follow.  What do I know?  He devoured the book in two days and loved it.  He's eagerly awaiting the next in the series.
"The Lightning Thief (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, #1)",0786838655,Rick Riordan,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Julie_Price,Great story with colorful characters. Liked it a lot and days later I still hadn't forgotten it. Have recommended it to everyone.
"The Lightning Thief (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, #1)",0786838655,Rick Riordan,Barnes and Noble,4.6,btn-sdsn,"I picked up this series because every once in a while I enjoy the child's fantasy instead of adult fiction.  Also, I enjoy helping my friends who are teachers find new material to help keep students interesting in reading.  I did not know what to expect, although I knew the book was brought to life on film.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  The inventive aspect of bringing greek mythology to modern day living is ingenious.  Having taken a year of mythology in school, it was wonderful to see a new way of getting young people interested a type of history that does not seem to be explored much.  Not only will these books excite young readers to keep with the books, but also the books might just interest the reader enough to look into ancient history.  My only drawback is there are ancient stories mentioned in the books and sometimes not explained.  (Meaning outside reading will need to occur).  Although these stories are not central in any way to the books, it is nice to know the history.  I had to refresh my memory on a few points. Great to read with your children if you read chapter books.    Overall, great reading for old and young alike."
"Little Women (Little Women, #1)",0451529308,Louisa May Alcott,Barnes and Noble,3.4,Jgirl09,"The March family is forced to be with out their father during the war. The four sisters: Meg, the beautiful eldest, Jo, the tomboy author, Beth, the tender-hearted, and Amy, the romantic artist, face many timeless struggles that girls of all ages face. Their story only brings them closer and captures you in the process. 
  In my opinion, the book Little Women is a classic book for many ages. I thought the book was interesting and I personally have read the book at least twice. The book has a timeless theme. It also has characters that relates to most.
  In conclusion, I would suggest you read it at least once. The March family reminds you that even in rough times you can get through it. Louisa May Alcott has created in my opinion a timeless book. This book will probably remain popular for many years.
  The book was interesting and great for girls especially, but don't let that stop you boys from reading it, too. I liked it so much I watched the movie."

Jane Eyre,0142437204,"Charlotte Brontë, Michael Mason",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"This book was amazing, truly fantastic! All my classmates gave me weird looks because it looked strange 'im in 8th grade' but I ignored them and read it anyway and it was just, just, I can't say, you know! the ending made me so happy that i cryed, crazy huh? I handed it to my teacher and gushed, 'it was beautiful, so beautiful!' 'it was her copy'  so if your some random person looking to see if this book is good, IT IS. If a kid as younge as me can appreciate it fully, you have to understand how utterly perfect it is! Read read! ^ ^"
Jane Eyre,0142437204,"Charlotte Brontë, Michael Mason",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Ivy-Shoelaces,"I read this book for my AP English class; we all kind of dreaded it whe we first heard. I was once told by a friend that it was horrible and that I should never, ever read it. I did, anyway, and I was thoroughly surprised and I enjoyed every bit of it!
Knowing very little about the plot (I'd only been told there's a crazy person in an attic --- which I forgot about), or even Bronte's writing style, I read the first ten chapters with shock and awe that the story was about a ten-year-old. Although the entire book is not about a ten-year-old, I was quickly taken with the plot and characters and just descriptions of England at that time. 
This book read quickly with alternately likeable and despicable characters, unusual language, and beautiful plot. 
My only complaint is that one character, Adele, speaks chiefly in French. I was lucky enough to be taking French classes while reading this, so I could piece together what she was essentially saying. What she says is not of a whole lot of importance, but it does bring the book to a halt at times.
All in all, Jane Eyre exceeded my expectations by leaps and bounds and I enjoyed reading it immensely."
Jane Eyre,0142437204,"Charlotte Brontë, Michael Mason",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"Jane Eyre is quite possibly one of my favorite books, one that I have read many times. I bought this edition because I thought the cover was pretty and the fantastic price. Bronte's original text is flawless (although Hindustani is spelled differently in my other copy)I give Bronte 5 stars, however, the introduction by Joyce Carol Oates is terrible. I found it choppy and not that relevant to the story. I don't believe for two seconds that Bertha Mason's insanity was caused by syphilis. I just don't. I also don't buy that Jane thinks human love is more important than God. If she did why did she spend so much time on her knees in prayer? Not one summary, review or movie version I have seen of this story acknowledges any sort of higher power in a non nutcase way. What a shame, I think Bronte should get more credit and less speculation. Let's just take it in the context she wished. I feel better after venting my opinions, bottom line if you want a good copy of Jane Eyre this will work, just ignore the introduction."
Water for Elephants,1565125606,Sara Gruen,Barnes and Noble,4.3,theReader278,I loved reading this wonderful book! It is a story you don't forget.
Water for Elephants,1565125606,Sara Gruen,Barnes and Noble,4.3,LCH47,"The story moves cleverly between the world of 90, or possibly, 93 year old, Jacob, in a nursing home, as he tells the story of his life, the Depression era and the circus world. He was twenty-three and almost ready to take his final exam, when he receives word that both of his parents were in a car accident and did not survive. There was no money as he sat to take his final exam to become a veterinarian. Feeling desperate Jacob jumps on a moving train instead. Having no idea he has jumped on a circus train, he decides he has nothing left and starts working with the circus. He meets a beautiful woman, Marlena, but finds out quickly she is married to a mad-man. However, she returns the attraction and a great love story begins. Water for Elephants is a compelling story that tells us all about growing old, corrupt management, animal cruelty, wonderful animals, kindness and loyalty between people and between people and animals in a world where indifference and cruelty are common. The author's obvious extensive research of history and circus life added so much interest to the background of a wonderful meaningful, love story. This is such a wonderful read and well worth your time!"
Water for Elephants,1565125606,Sara Gruen,Barnes and Noble,4.3,vivico1,"Very good story that is well written. Great transitions from the old Jacob to his younger self. Who knew a story about circus trains could be such a great book. Due to some graphic language or truth of treatment to some animals, I would recommend this book, but with that caution to anyone who may be too young and possibly some adults who are very sensitive to that kind of thing. It is hard to read at times about the cruelty, but it is real."
The Book Thief,0375831002,Markus Zusak,Barnes and Noble,4.5,AvidBookworm,"This is probably one of the most unique books I've read in like¿forever!  The story is narrated by Death and centers around the events of Nazi Germany in the 1940's.  I rarely give a book five stars.  In that same token, I try to steer away from recommending books that have a morose tone, but this is a true exception. As much as you hope for, long for, and pray for a happy event to occur, you need to keep reminding yourself that the story is being told by Death, so chances of that happening are slim-to-none. The main character of the story, Liesel Meminger, captured my heart.  I loved the way the author, Markus Zusak, developed Liesel's character throughout the story and by a slight-of-hand, he added a side kick to the story, Rudy, who out of no where comes be one of the favored characters of the story. Great technique Zusak!The premise of the story is unique and captivating.  The narrator, Death, is much like Liesel where he/she has a way with words.  Both of them recognize words for what they really are¿they can be used to stimulate good or evil.  Through the power of words, we see how Hitler was able to control a country and persecute people.Great book, awesome character development, insightful recount of Nazi Germany, and a life-long lesson¿what else can you ask for in a book?"
The Book Thief,0375831002,Markus Zusak,Barnes and Noble,4.5,angeleyesAS,"I was hooked right away by the unique narrator, Death, who provides a running commentary.  Every character in this story was endearing and I fell in love with them, Liesel, Rudy, Hans, Max and Rosa.  The story of Leisel, a small, young German girl who watches her brother die and her mother disappears, then lives with a foster family that barely manages to survive. In the process of scrounging for a living, Liesel begins stealing books in Nazi territory. She and her friend, Rudy discover the power and excitement that words and language provide. A book begins the story. Daily chores of survival, Liesel experiences her fragile childhood under oppressive and endless horrors of war. There is so much hopelessness, suffering and despair. She bonds quickly with her foster father and slowly with her strict foster mother.  He helps her to trust and teaches her to read a souvenir she steals at her brother's funeral. This story is an inspiring display of how something as small as a book and reading can be the last life line in a young girls life. This beautifully written, complex book is a haunting revelation and once read will not be soon forgotten!"

"City of Bones (The Mortal Instruments, #1)",1416914285,Cassandra Clare,Barnes and Noble,4.5,love-2-dance,"if your trying to decide to read this series or not...dont wait! trust me. the first few pages, i cant lie, i was feeling like i was playing catch up. it starts off in the middle of a night out on the town without really explaining much. but after only a few pages i got my bearings and learned who the characters were and how they were related to the main character. WARNING!!!...after you understand whats going on, you wont be able to stop. all types of events start to happen in Clary's life which will hav no choice but to lure you in with her! its not crazy-busy but also leaves no room for you to get bored...the perfect mix. :) everytime there wasnt action or almost unbearable suspense, i was soaked up in the lust and romance of Jace and Clary. although it is written in 3rd person, it is so easy to become the characters and be overwhelmed with their intense emotion. its sad for me to admitt, and i probably would hav beat myself up for even thinking this before i read this series, but the Mortal Instruments Series goes hand in hand with the Twilight saga...or probably even better. this is definitely for people who fell in love with Twilight and just cant seem to find a good enough book to fill its spot. And although the end of this book can be heartbreaking...dont give up on it!! it gets better and better with each sequel!!!!"
"City of Bones (The Mortal Instruments, #1)",1416914285,Cassandra Clare,Barnes and Noble,4.5,theReader278,I loved reading this wonderful book! It is a story that keeps you entertained for hours.
"City of Bones (The Mortal Instruments, #1)",1416914285,Cassandra Clare,Barnes and Noble,4.5,mbriski,"City of Bones is the first book in The Mortal Instruments trilogy for teens.  It's an edgy urban fantasy with a roller-coaster plot, intricate and original world-building, and complex characters.  Clare's combination of sarcastic humor and deep honesty makes for pitch-perfect dialogue and compelling character development.  A must-read for teen fantasy buffs, this book should also be of interest to adult fans of urban fantasy.  No surprise that the first two books in this series have already hit the New York Times Bestseller List-- This is some of the best stuff to hit the teen market in the last few years."
"Eclipse (Twilight, #3)",0316160202,Stephenie Meyer,Barnes and Noble,4.6,vickytren,I just love all of Stephenie Meyer's books. As a fan I would recommend them. can't wait to read the next!!!!!
"Eclipse (Twilight, #3)",0316160202,Stephenie Meyer,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Stacie08,"I resisted reading this series for so long.  I couldn't imagine a ""teenage vampire"" book would hold much interest for me.  Boy was I wrong!  I read the series straight through in 2 weeks and loved it!  The courtship between Edward and Bella is pure,tender and romantic.  Edward is chivlarous, intelligent and protective and Bella is sweet, stubborn and selfless.  Jacob and the rest of the supporting characters add variety and some humor to the already fascinating story line. The love story created by Stephanie Meyer reminded me of some of the classics I have read over and over. 
I have never felt so attached to characters in an novel.  I even found myself dreaming of them (it is ok to laugh at me I did too). For the first time ever I even went to the author's website and read everything about her and the story development.  I am sad that she is not writing the series from Edward's perspective like she intended, but I do understand why she made that decision. I highly recommend this series even if you think a vampire/werewolf book sounds corny."
"Eclipse (Twilight, #3)",0316160202,Stephenie Meyer,Barnes and Noble,4.6,theReader278,I loved and loved reading this wonderful book! It has a story that keeps you entertained for hours. Stephenie Meyer is a fantastic writer.
"Eragon (The Inheritance Cycle, #1)",0375826696,Christopher Paolini,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Eliz_L,"Eragon is a blazing start to the wildly popular Inheritance saga. Paolini weaves a suspenseful, exiting tale that will keep you turning the pages! The book starts out a tad boring, and it might take a bit of effort to get beyond the first 10 pages, but after that, one event after another sends you to Agla&#235;sia, experiencing Eragon¿s feelings like your own. As Eragon journeys from his home to avenge the death of a loved one, you learn more and more about the infamous Empire and Galbatorix, as well as his black dragon Shruikan. While Eragon studies magic and swordplay, he also learns some secrets better left unknown...I couldn't put it down until I had reached the last page, and even then I hungered for the next book in the series. If you're in the mood for a fantasy book that¿s chock full of fighting, swordplay and good vs. evil, you¿ve come to the right place! I must warn you though, you're not going to like it when you've read all three and Paolini hasn't finished the fourth book!"
"Eragon (The Inheritance Cycle, #1)",0375826696,Christopher Paolini,Barnes and Noble,4.5,BookWorm0327p,"This series is fabulous!I honestly think you can't call yourself a fantasy lover until you've read this. When I first picked this up I was so excited that the third book (and what I thought was the last book) would be out in time, so I didn't have to wait for it, but then Paolini pulled a fast one and no I (and many others) have to wait in suspense for the 4th book to come out! I'm not to upset about it though because i know the last book will top them all and it keeps Eragon and his dragon Saphira's story going a little longer! If you're looking for a book filled with adventure, fantasy, and even some romance this is the 1st book i'd recommend!"
"Eragon (The Inheritance Cycle, #1)",0375826696,Christopher Paolini,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Cressy,"Eragon was a very organized book, with engaging characters, and a well polished plot. It is a good representation of a boy, not yet 15, becoming one of the almighty, but now nearly extinct dragon riders with lessons in life we should all consider.
     Eragon is about a young farm boy (named Eragon), who finds a polished blue stone while hunting for food in the Spine. The stone hatches, and from it emerges a dragon. Saphira, as she is later named, is the first dragon born after the famed dragon riders were destroyed by Galbatorix, who is now king, and his forsworn. He raises his dragon in secret, afraid the king may find him, but unable to disown the child dragon. Soon, Galbatorix's evil minions, the Ra'zac, pass through the town and learn of the dragon. While Saphira flees into the Spine with Eragon, his home is destroyed and his uncle mortally wounded. Eragon sets out to avenge the Ra'zac with the old storyteller, Brom, who may be more then who he says he is, leading full speed into this thrilling novel.
      I highly enjoyed Eragon, and cannot evaluate the book without high praise for the writing style, characters, and depth. Palini's writing is organized, and descriptive, enabling you to take part in the character's emotion, mind, and setting without overflowing you with information. His characters are full in depth, mind, emotion, and history, enabling you to feel as if they could be anyone in your classroom, or anyone walking through the street. Though you must not forget the plot itself, as it is upbeat, remarkable, and logical. 
     Overall, I absolutely recommend this book to a friend, relative, or bookworm. I complement the style, plot, depth, and honesty of a book marking the journey of a young boy to a fierce warrior. Eragon is a read well worth the time, effort, and price."
"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, #1)",0345391802,Douglas Adams,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Benz1966,"I know, I know.. I should have read this book before then. I have a vague memory of attempting to read it about 10 years ago - but that was when books only interested me if they had a half-dressed hunk on the cover and promised a few hours of romantic dreams. 

Clearly, this book didn't do that - so on the shelf it went. Now, in reading through the 1001 books to read I saw the name again and thought, hm.. perhaps I should give it a try. I'm glad I did. 

While much of the book feels like it's still over my head (and it took me longer to read then I thought it would, seeing as I had to keep going back over things I didn't understand), I got more than my fair share of giggles out of it. 

I don't think there's really anyone out there who doesn't know what this book is about - so let me tell you what my impressions of it were before, and after reading it. 

Before I started reading this book I thought I knew the story. I understood 42 was somewhere in the book, and my impressions of the story came from an old PC game I picked up several years ago (I gave up on that game very quickly too). I knew there was a ship computer that talked, and that there was a depressed robot. And mostly I knew it was the story of a man named Arthur Dent. What I didn't know was how it all fit together. 

Now I've read the book. I've laughed at the ship computer, finally understand that XKCD comic about the Kindle, loved loved loved Marvin the depressed robot and felt much of the same confusion that Arthur Dent must have felt. And I still don't quite know how it all fits together. 

And that's why I like the book so much. Because I'm going to have to read it, and read it again - and although I think I still probably won't get it, I think I'll enjoy reading it every time, just like I enjoyed reading it this time. And really, if you can't enjoy reading a book... what's the point?"

"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, #1)",0345391802,Douglas Adams,Barnes and Noble,4.4,A-Adducchio,"If total randomness is not your thing, steer clear of this book.  Douglas Adams' ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" starts with the Earth being destroyed to make way for a hyper spatial expressway.  The main character, Arthur Dent, and his friend, Ford Prefect, escape annihilation by hitchhiking their way on board one of the Vogon ships that were in the process demolishing the Earth.  After being found and thrown into space, they are rescued by the Heart of Gold, a state-of-the-art ship stolen by the president of the galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox.  When Arthur and Ford meet their hitchhiking hosts, they discover it to be Zaphod and Trillian.  Arthur had previously met Trillian at a party on Earth, just before Zaphod swooped in and took her off into space.  The four travelers find their way to Magrathea, a legendary planet known for manufacturing custom planets.  When they get to Magrathea, Zaphod, Trillian, and Ford are captured and detained by Magratheans.  Arthur is greeted by an old man, Slartibartfast.  He educates Arthur on the history of Magrathea and the computer designed to answer the question to life.  This computer was known as Deep-Thought and produced the answer of forty-two.  The question, to which this answer belongs, is not known by Deep-Thought.  Luckily, Deep-Thought provides the plans for a super computer that will produce this question.  The Earth is the key, but if you want to know more, you will just have to read the book.  While I found this book to be confusing at times, it was also extremely entertaining.  Until you finish the book, it comes across as being completely random. But after finishing the book, everything sort of comes together.  The randomness is what makes this book what it is; without it, it would just be a boring story about four people.  I definitely recommend reading this book, but if possible, read the book before watching the movie.  While entertaining, the movie is not nearly as good as the book.  It is a more enjoyable read if done before watching the movie."

It's not unreadable but, it is pretty annoying.  I have a paper copy of the book so I didn't really need a nook copy. 

Save your money for a copy that isn't full of errors."

"Breaking Dawn (Twilight, #4)",031606792X,Stephenie Meyer,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"Breaking Dawn is definitely my favorite book in the Twilight Series. It takes on a more mature tone, and leads the story in a completely unexpected and different direction than the first 3 books. I highly recommend reading the series, you won't be disappointed."
The Secret Life of Bees,0142001740,Sue Monk Kidd,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Sarah_661,I'm only eleven years old and loved the book. I got it at the library after seeing the trailer to the movie. It is a very humbling book. I don't think that kids under 13 should read it though. It has lots of cursing and is extremly descriptive in parts it shouldn't be. It was an awsome book though. Please read it you will love it!!!P.S. The books i recomended are even better!!!
The Secret Life of Bees,0142001740,Sue Monk Kidd,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Andapanda29,"The story was eloquent, well written, and poignant, but what I think really grabbed me and kept my keen interest was the narration by Jenna Lamia.  Her voice was as fluid and sweet as honey and her story-telling just brought you right into the story.  One could almost be convinced Lily Owens was an actual person and Jenna's voice was really Lily's as she told you the story of her summer.  I loved listening to the audiobook and when recommending this book to anyone, I always tell them you cannot fully appreciate the beauty of this story without hearing Jenna's narration of it on audiobook.  I've listened to it twice already."
The Secret Life of Bees,0142001740,Sue Monk Kidd,Barnes and Noble,4.4,k-dub,"I really enjoyed The Secret Life of Bees. When I was first told that I had to read it I was kind of disappointed. I started reading and it was so good! The book was about a girl by the name of Lily. She was 14 years old and had no mother. She was told by her father, T-Ray, that she killed her. Lily was sick of T-ray and decided to run away from him. She found a box with her mother's stuff in it and found the name of a town: Tiburon, South Carolina. Lily and her nanny, Rosaleen, ran away. Lily gets to Tiburon and is looking for the black Mary on anything. She soon found it in a grocery store. It was on a honey bottle. She asked where it was from and the grocery store guy said it was from and he told her. She finds herself face to face with a bright pink house. She meets June Boatwright and then August Boatwright. She asks if she can have a place to stay and August gladly accepts her. Lily then lives in the honey house with Rosaleen. May Boatwright is the next person she meets, then the Daughters of Mary. She loves all of them immediately, except June. She doesn't get along with her. Then she meets Zach and starts to like him. Lily lies to all of the people I just mentioned for a while and eventually the truth had to come out. She tells August everything. Many other things happen so I recommend you read the book. 
	I really liked this book and would recommend it because it is full of suspense and action. A few things might even surprise you! It's a book you will want to read over and over again. I thought the author's message was that life is short and everybody has things in their life that they're not proud of. I learned that people's lives are hard and they need at least one good friend that they can rely on. People are not always as they seem even if they pretend everything is perfect."
The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,0142437174,"Mark Twain, John Seelye, Guy Cardwell",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"This classic of American literature is perhaps the most misunderstood and maligned book since the Bible.  Nobody who has ever actually read the book could ever call it racist.  True, it is filled with the 'N' word that decent people find offensive, but it was necessary in the context.  This wonderful book is just as powerfully anti-slavery as 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' by Harriett Beecher Stowe, but while her book is still praised, Mark Twain's book is being banned from high school libraries.  I first read this book at age 12, and have re-read it at least every two years ever since.  I'm in my 40's now, but Huck and Jim take me right back to 12 every time I see them again."
The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,0142437174,"Mark Twain, John Seelye, Guy Cardwell",Barnes and Noble,3.9,3GildeRJ,"""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,"" by Mark Twain,  is a book about Huckleberry Finn, the namesake of the book.  Continuing the events of the last book ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,"" Huck is living with  widow Douglas, who has adopted him.  Huck gets bored of the widow trying to civilize him, he runs out and his abusive father finds him.  His father takes him in, and Huck tries to get out.  He finds an old saw and cuts his way out of the house and fakes his own death.  He catches a canoe and hides out on Jackson's island, Huck finds the widow's slave, Jim, who is also hiding out.  Tom and Jim build a raft, and escape down the river.       During their trip, Huck and Jim meet a few colorful characters, including two feuding families, and two cons who claim to be a king and a duke.  Huck may not seem so, but he is very clever, and able to see through the king and dukes' antics, which makes him sick to his stomach.  Huck is always trying to do good, and sometimes has a conflict with himself in deciding exactly what is good.  One night, he even thinks about turning Jim in, because he feels bad for helping the widow's slave escape.  He tells two white men in a canoe to check the raft, claiming his sick uncle to be on it.  He ends up convincing them that his uncle has smallpox, so they give him 40 dollars and leave him alone.         I think that this book is great.  One of the best I've ever read.  This book's plot may be a little over-used, a boy helping a slave escape from his master, but you never really know what's going to happen.  Mark Twain is one of the best authors from whom I've ever read.  This book easily makes me want to read some other books of his.  There are twists, turns, and, like a punch to the face in a dark room, you never see them coming.  If your okay with a few politically incorrect words (The book was written in the 1800s, when slavery was legal) and you love adventure, I definitley recommend this book to you."

Charlotte's Web,0064410935,"E.B. White, Garth Williams, Rosemary Wells",Barnes and Noble,4.5,AnastasiaSS,"Charlotte's Web is an amazing book. When I was younger, I never wanted to read it. I have watched the movie and loved it. Now I am homeschooling my daughter and this book popped up for a novel requirement. She was against it at first. But from the very first moment of us reading it together--we were both hooked. I woudl limit it to 2 chapters per day. And after reading those 2 chapters--we both wanted to read more. It was a very hard book to put down. We both loved every minute of it. And i enjoyed reading this book (at the age of 35)--more because I read it with my daughter. We laughed together, we cried together. Imagine me, a 35 year old mother cryong when Charlotte died. This book is truly a wonderful peiece of literature that everyone should read. A true classic. However--now my daughter is begging me for a baby pig. Someday--she will read this to her children and they will hopefully beg her for one also."
Charlotte's Web,0064410935,"E.B. White, Garth Williams, Rosemary Wells",Barnes and Noble,4.5,onlyminordetails,"My Thoughts:

I chose to reread Charlotte's Web for Banned Books Week this year mostly because I haven't read it in probably more than 15 years. I did read it numerous times growing up, so I remembered a lot of it. What I took away this time around was probably more than I ever took away back then though. Most of you already know the story, so I won't go into that. What I will talk about is how the book made me feel.

One of those things was Fern. She was loving and caring and full of life. She knew what was going on with the animals and she talked about it all the time. There was something extra special about her. I think what got to me was how much she just enjoyed the simple pleasures in life. Sitting on the stool by Wilbur's pen, taking in the sights and sounds. How many of us get to do that anymore? How many of us wish we could do that right now?

Of course, there was also Charlotte. Wonderful and amazing Charlotte. Her outlook on life and her wisdom are amazing. The way she and Wilbur interacted touched my heart. Wilbur learned a lot about life from Charlotte, and in the end he became the terrific pig she always knew he could be. The absolute best thing about their friendship can be summed up in this conversation between the two of them:

&quot;Why did you do all this for me?&quot; he asked. &quot;I don't deserve it. I've never done anything for you.&quot;

&quot;You have been my friend,&quot; replied Charlotte. &quot;That in itself is a tremendous thing.&quot;

That quote... typing it out is bringing the tears to my eyes. It's such a beautiful quote.

Reading Charlotte's Web by E.B. White again brought back so many memories and caused me to have a brighter outlook on life. Friends are important, helping each other is important, enjoying the simple things in life is important. If you haven't read this one since you were a kid, I strongly recommend that you read it again sometime. It will warm your heart just as it did before. I am certainly glad I took the time to.

My Rating: Exceptional"
Charlotte's Web,0064410935,"E.B. White, Garth Williams, Rosemary Wells",Barnes and Noble,4.5,firhetrick on LibraryThing,Have you ever read a book called Charlotte's Web?

The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,1400032717,Mark Haddon,Barnes and Noble,4.1,NRtrack,"I knew from the very start i was going to like this book.  Haddon, the author, writes this book from the point of view of an autistic child.  I personally know people that are autistic and Haddon did a fantastic job of capturing day-to-day life of an autistic child.  When i started reading the book, i realized that it would not be like any book I have ever read.  Like any book it started of with chapter one, however, the next chapter was numbered three.  In the beginning of the chapter the boy (who is writing this book) went of on a tangent explaining that the chapters will be prime numbers because prime numbers make him feel calm.  I enjoyed it because some books get boring because they have a plot and all you do is read about it.  However, every other chapter in this book diverted from the main plot to talk about something random, because this is how the mind of an autistic child works. Throughout the book i found my self almost getting annoyed by the way the boy acted, then i realized this is because the author did such a great job of captivating the real life of an autistic child.  This is written by a British man so the language is very harsh.  If you want a great book to read, this is it"
The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,1400032717,Mark Haddon,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Aisha_Renee,"I didn't know what to expect when I picked it up in the store, but I'd heard it was good. Only on about page ten, I found it hard to put down. No doubt, looking at life through an autistic boy's eyes was different, yet intriguing at the same time. Christopher Boone speaks his thoughts, and they made me think of life in a way I hadn't before. There were basically two plots in this book: Who killed Wellington, and if his mother's dead, where is he getting these letters from? Nonetheless, a good read that was full of mystery until the very end."
The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,1400032717,Mark Haddon,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"This book is a very easy read.  It is written from the perspective of a autistic fifteen year old.  Although some people say this book was poorly written and did not have a good plot.  The story was not a story to tell about how the autistic boy discovered who killed the dog, but rather a story to show what life is like for people with special needs.  Having some experience with mentally disabled, I found this book super interesting. It shows that people with disabilities are not stupid.  This boy was great at math.  I know a guy with down's syndrome who could tell you the day of the week you were born on within five seconds of you telling him the date of your birth.  This book was written to have a profound meaning.  Instead it was written to show that people with disablities are still people."
The Girl on the Train,1594633665,Paula Hawkins,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN!

What happens when you know information on a missing person but no one will believe you because you are an &quot;unreliable witness?&quot;  That is what Rachel, the main character in this book, is going through in this thriller that is completely reminiscent of Hitchcock's Rear window.  It was written from the prospectives of three different women.  All characters are train wrecks waiting to happen.  It was like watching a wreck happen in slow motion.  There were lots of twists and turns and just when I thought I had it pegged, I would find out something else and be steered in a different direction.  

Though I did not care much for any of the characters, the book was extremely well written.  The author did an amazing job of building the intensity of the plot.  It did start a little slow, but as the story progressed, I just could not put it down!  I had to find out what happened to Meghan -- the missing girl.  The author also did a great job of portraying the life of an alcoholic.  She hit the nail on the head with that one.  

Anyway, incredible job for a debut book.  I absolutely will be looking for more from this author.  Thanx Ms. Hawkins for a fantastic read and a night of no sleep!   :~)

The Girl on the Train,1594633665,Paula Hawkins,Barnes and Noble,3.9,isniffbooks,"I hope unputdownable is a legit word because it most definitely describes THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN! So glad to report that 
THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN definitely lives up to all the pre-release buzz and anticipation!

So I begin on page 1 (where else?!) and I&rsquo;m reading, reading, reading &mdash; there&rsquo;s just this hard-to-define quality that makes it so 
easy to get sucked into the story right away &mdash; and I&rsquo;m turning page after page, and then, bam! The next chapter switches to 
someone else&rsquo;s point of view. I should have expected this since the first chapter was titled Rachel, but the chapter heading 
was just something I noticed and promptly forgot about as I dove into the story. And I was like, who is this new person?! What about 
Rachel?! What is going on?! But I ended up loving how the narration changed for each chapter &mdash; it leaves readers wanting more 
because Hawkins often concludes chapters with mini-cliffhangers or an unexpected revelation.

And speaking of narration, I really liked how things (a vague term, I know, but I don&rsquo;t want to spoil anything!) were revealed. Little 
clues, from the past and present, that just paint a bigger picture as to who the characters are and what brought them to their 
present state-of-affairs. I loved how with the drop of a sentence, Hawkins could completely change what you thought was going 
on with someone and their situation. This same effect can also get you to empathize with an unlikable character &mdash; because 
these characters are definitely flawed and have their own issues and secrets.

I stayed up well past midnight to finish up THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN. I will admit though, I was a tiny bit disappointed in how things 
were revealed (starting around page 260 or so) and wrapped up. But overall, I really enjoyed my reading experience &mdash; I even 
gasped aloud a few times startling my husband out of his own reading reverie. THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is an impressive first 
novel and I&rsquo;d definitely read whatever Hawkins writes next.

As a side note, there is profanity in this book. However, the explicit language choices did make sense in character and context so, 
much to my surprise, it didn&rsquo;t end up being an issue for me.

Disclosure: I received a complimentary review copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review. The opinions are my own."

Second... where do i begin in saying how good it is? The world feels fully formed and the writing is breathtakingly good. The character are all well thought out and are multi dimensional. The plot has just the right amount of twists. And the story is incredible.

Yes this book was written as ""an atheist response to narnia""... but it goes so far beyond that as to become a fully fledged fantasy classic on its own merits. Give it a read - you will not regret it."
"The Golden Compass (His Dark Materials, #1)",0679879242,Philip Pullman,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"Woah, woah, woah. Guess what. The golden compass, is FICTION. Evryone knows what that means, right? It is not real. Its just a story. It has absolutely nothing to do with God. Quit freaking out and saying you hate this book because your religious. If you dont like it because you think it attacks god, that doesnt mean it isnt a good story. Im christian, too, i 
understand, believe me. But all of you are overreacting. If you dont agree with it, leave it alone. Its not like one series will destroy your entire religion. Its not like its trying to prove god isnt real. Its just a fantasy. And all of you who dislike it because you think that just wont look past your church to see reality. Its obvious. Instead of making a hateful comment like the church tells you not to do, just read something else for god's sake."
"The Golden Compass (His Dark Materials, #1)",0679879242,Philip Pullman,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"The Golden Compass is a thrilling book. I highly suggest reading it. This book leaves you hanging and craving for more of Pullmans brillance. Lyra and her deamon,Pan, captivate you in there world and you never want to leave.   Pullman manages to suck you up in this book and make you never want to leave the adventure."
Wuthering Heights,0393978893,"Emily Brontë, Richard J. Dunn",Barnes and Noble,3.9,mmillet on LibraryThing,"Supposedly one of the 'great' love stories of all time, I have always felt Catherine and Heathcliff's relationship was selfish, manipulative and just plain weird. I could never understand why she felt she could marry Linton and still have Heathcliff on the side and that Edgar would accept him too. I guess she could see herself aiding Heathcliff in the process, but I just can't see how she could rationalize that. Maybe it is just a bitter reminder of how stringent class distinctions were in that period. For the longest time I felt nothing but disgust for Heathcliff until after thinking about this book for some time: he may be vindictive, mean spirited and low but he did have a rough life where he was mistreated at every turn. I think his one redeeming moment was when Cathy and Hareton were starting to connect and he couldn't bear to punish them -- perhaps he did have a heart if only it lay beneath layers and layers of darkness. This time around I actually felt like Catherine was more the villain than he ever was.I'm glad I reread this one from an adult standpoint. I know that love isn't always passionately destructive and all consuming -- but 'Wuthering Heights' truly is an engrossing tale. I highly recommend the recent Masterpiece adaptation, it was fantastic!"
Wuthering Heights,0393978893,"Emily Brontë, Richard J.

The entire story could probably be condensed into 10 pages, and it might actually be interesting then.Um, do Catherine and Heathcliff love each other?  OMG! It was so hard to tell when that's all Brontë talks about without actually going anywhere with the plot!  Ugh!  Awful story!"

My Sister's Keeper,0743454537,Jodi Picoult,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"I have not read an intriguing and interesting book in a while.  So, I was in search of ¿one of those books that you can hardly put down¿. As I skimmed through a list of various best-selling novels, I came across My Sister¿s Keeper by Jodi Picoult, which was recommended to me. Immediately I picked up the book and began to read. Sure enough, this book was nearly impossible for me to stop reading. After reading this book, I gleaned that Picoult is a fascinating writer, and this was definitely no banal story. If you are in search of a brilliantly written novel with a very interesting story line, then I would definitely recommend My Sister¿s Keeper by Jodi Picoult. 	My Sister¿s Keeper is the story of a thirteen-year-old girl, Anna Fitzgerald, who was conceived as a bone marrow match for her older sister, Kate, who has leukemia. Anna has been a donor for Kate her entire life, and this story revolves around her sudden opposition and dilemmas regarding this situation. The reader is immediately enthralled to the plot the moment Anna makes an astonishing decision in one of the beginning chapters, which the rest of the story revolves around. My Sister¿s Keeper is also the story of family life and revolves around the family¿s struggle to maintain their love and support for each other. It describes how no family is perfect, and forces you to love the Fitzgerald family and feel their pain through their many hardships. It was very difficult for me to put the book down and stop reading because I was so anxious to discover the ending result of this predicament that takes place throughout the entire novel. I was shocked by the unwonted resolution, however was very satisfied. I believe this is an ideal ending because the reader cannot even predict how the story will conclude, and it is a summation to all of the present conflicts. Picoult does an excellent job at writing this end result.	The author of My Sister¿s Keeper, Jodi Picoult has a very unique and compelling writing style that gets readers hooked to her books instantaneously. Her use of description is extremely skillful, and I felt as if I were present in the plot of the story. A component of her writing that I liked was her use of numerous flashbacks. I enjoyed reading them when they appeared because it helps the reader to understand the current situation or feeling she is writing about. They were often very interesting to read, and they gave me great insight to future events in the book. Another characteristic that I am pleased by is the fact that each chapter in the novel is told by a different significant character. I value this because it is interesting to see each person¿s perspective and feelings on a certain event or circumstance. By doing this, Picoult also creates a sense of unbiased feeling. It restricts the reader from having an unfair opinion about a specific character, and allows them to create their own opinions about each character. 	If you enjoy reading novels about everyday life and the complications that arise in it, then I would recommend My Sister¿s Keeper, by Jodi Picoult. Especially if you enjoy an intriguing storyline that is exceptionally well written, be sure to pick up a copy of this book. Picoult is an exceptionally fascinating writer, and after reading this masmasterpiece I will be sure to read one her other novels in the near future. It is a book of emotion, attachment, and suffering that keeps the reader interested for the entire story."
My Sister's Keeper,0743454537,Jodi Picoult,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"If you like well length books that will keep you intrigued until the end and is completely awesome, this is your type of book. If you watched the movie YOU WILL ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE BOOK! READ READ READ!!"
My Sister's Keeper,0743454537,Jodi Picoult,Barnes and Noble,4.6,DFormAZ,My wife had told me to read this book for a long time because she knows I enjoy multiperspective stories.  It was a really good but heartbreaking story.  As a parent of two healthy children I know I am very lucky.
Slaughterhouse-Five,0385333846,Kurt Vonnegut Jr.,Barnes and Noble,4.2,jp_the_bookie,"I'm going into my junior year of high school in the fall, I read this book during the 1st days of my summer vacation because:
a) My English teacher told my class how amazing and absurb Vonnegut was and her plot synopsis captured my interest
b) The same English teacher spent all semester telling my class how are brains were turning to mush from reading Twilight/Harry Potter and that we should read more classics. So I decided to start reading CollegeBoard's 100 books for incoming college freshmen.

I was told from the get-go that this was a very very very eccentric novel and thats the kind of book I enjoy. I was very frustrated with myself up until about the last fifty pages because I did not understand the significance of the novel. However, the last fifty pages clicked all of the seemingly disconnected pieces together.

Mrs. Weil, my beloved English teacher, told us that if you cannot see the point of a piece of literature, you didn't read it carefully enough. This especially goes towards this novel, you have to read extremely closely if you want to understand or get something out of it. 

In the end, the book was very insightful and I suggest that everyone read it."
Slaughterhouse-Five,0385333846,Kurt Vonnegut Jr.,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"Set during World War II, Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five is a humorous antiwar book. Billy Pilgrim is a war veteran who becomes ""unstuck in time."" He seems to be obsessed with the aliens, called the Tralfamadorians, that supposedly abducted him and could see in the fourth dimension. Right off the bat, Slaughterhouse-Five has caught our attention. As we read through the novel, the way we experience it is the same as Billy sees time, disconnected and random. The book keeps jumping from time period to time period, thoroughly confusing the reader. In some places, Vonnegut makes himself a character in his own novel. It is confusing to the point that the reader has no idea if Billy or Vonnegut is talking.The novel makes us slightly disillusioned in the fact that we don't know the difference between real and fake. We are convinced (as is his family) that Billy is crazy and what he tells us about the Tralfamadorians is obviously untrue. But how are we to know if everything else he tells us of the war is true? The satire and irony in this book add comic relief to what would usually be a depressing scene, to our enjoyment.The genius of Slaughterhouse-Five is that Vonnegut seems so apathetic about war in places that we wonder why this is even considered an antiwar book. But the reality is that his use of understatement and reverse psychology arouses feelings in us. When he says war cannot be stopped, we think (more passionately than if he was agreeing with us) that yes, it can. When he says there is no such thing as free will, we say yes, there is. All in all, Slaughterhouse-Five is an enjoyable read, I highly recommend."
Slaughterhouse-Five,0385333846,Kurt Vonnegut Jr.,Barnes and Noble,4.2,XXXOOOBookwormOOOXXX,"A quick, and absolutely imperative read. This was my first Kurt Vonnegut read several years ago and I've grown to love his work. This book is a great step for anybody interested in Sci-fi books. The manipulation of time in this book is brilliant.I liked the book...you just have to remember that it is about one of the first accounts of a person sufferring from 'post traumatic stress syndrom'. I don't think ptss was even named at that time. You just keep thinking that someone should do something to help him...but at that time, WHAT?A thoughtful description of war in how indescribable it really is to experience. It claims there is war and always will be war. You'd have better luck at stopping a glacier. Also that hell is better than war. Since at least there would be no innocents suffering. Deals with things in a matter of fact tone. Anytime someone dies he will say, &quot;so it goes.&quot; He gets lost in his own timeline and wanders. Aliens take pity on him and show him that time is something that humans can't grasp. Everything that happens always will happen, always has happened and cannot be changed. A downer. Oh and &quot;war is fought by babies&quot;. It's thoroughly glamorized in movies and fiction. The reality is usually a bunch of teens straight out of high school fighting those battles.In my opinion this is the kind of book I should have studied when I was in school. There is so much to this little book that it deserves more thought than the poolside read that was my investment. Having said that, this is a really good book and I would fully recommend it. I just wish that I could have discussed this in English class in school, I would be interested in hearing other peoples opinion and in developing my own"

Gone with the Wind,0446675539,Margaret Mitchell,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Anonymous,"Gone With the Wind is a novel that takes place in the antebellum South. Scarlett O'Hara, a stubborn, strong-willed, lively young girl, is the main character. The beginning of the novel starts with her ordinary life: attending barbeques, flirting with her beaus, and worrying about what to wear. As the novel goes on, however, many trials, ultimately brought on by the war, turn Scarlett's world upside down, and all that she knows and takes for granted, disappears. These trials include escaping Atlanta when the Yankees come, remarrying twice, dealing with the death of her mother, and returning home to find that everything has changed. However, even though these would be a reason for anyone to stop living, the trials actually bring out how strong Scarlett really is, even though for the first 15-16 years of her life, she was pampered and lived in luxury. Through all of this, Scarlett believes she loves Ashley Wilkes, a boy from her childhood, brought up to be the epitome of 'good breeding'. She also has to deal with Melanie Wilkes, Ashley's wife, because in her despair, Scarlett rashly agreed to marry Melanie's brother, Charles. Most of Scarlett's main decisions are influenced by her infatuation with Ashley and her belief that they are supposed to be together. However, Scarlett's third husband, Rhett Butler, is the one she actually loves, although she doesn't know it. Rhett is the opposite of a gentleman in the eyes of the old-tradition Southerners, but his personality matches Scarlett. Both came from good families, but Rhett was disowned from his, and Scarlett goes against many of the lessons and etiquette she was taught. Underneath all the training, however, Scarlett is just as rebellious as Rhett and, she lets go of all her proper teachings to stay alive and support her family and relatives. She ends up not caring what others think, and holds onto the mantra of ""I'll think of it tomorrow"". Through her trials, she unwittingly comes to love and respect Melanie, even though she thinks she hates her for marrying Ashley. However, Melanie is the only woman in her life who actually really loved her. Also, Melanie is the one who makes Scarlett realize how much Rhett loves her, even though he never lets her know it. Because of this, Scarlett rushes back to Rhett, only to find that he ""doesn't give a damn"" anymore, but Scarlett's strong personality keeps her from breaking, and the novels ends with her words, ""tomorrow is another day."""
A Thousand Splendid Suns,1594489505,Khaled Hosseini,Barnes and Noble,4.6,1Katherine1,"This book is equally as good, and as haunting, as Kite Runner. This time the story is about two Afghani women. Life in Afghanistan is wretched enough, but to be a Muslim woman in Afghanistan can be lethal, especially after the Taliban come to power. This book is beautifully written and at times difficult to read, but it's also difficult to put down. Mariam and Laila are wonderfully-drawn characters that will stay with me forever. They made me know just how lucky I am to be an American woman, and how unfortunate life can be for Muslim women in Muslim countries. This book will break your heart, but it will also put it back together again. Highly recommended."
A Thousand Splendid Suns,1594489505,Khaled Hosseini,Barnes and Noble,4.6,ArcherPL,"Yes , I just finished Khaled Hosseini's second masterpiece and I am at cross roads of trying to pen down what the pages made me think and feel. Interestingly, I still haven't completed the Kite Runner but this one, I couldn't put down for a second. The first thing that strikes you about the book is the fact that it is the story of the lives of 2 women amidst a battered Afghanistan, spanning several decades, but more importantly, it is a story written by a man, completely from a woman's perspective. This is even more striking when you realize that this is the same author who made his readers' eyes sting with the accounts of ""Baba Jaan"" in the Kite Runner.

I am in no way qualified to critique this masterpiece but I don't want to lose the essence that it left me in me today. As one reads the book, one is made brutally aware of the atrocities that are lashed out on women in different levels of society in different ways. One feels a sense of revulsion towards fundamentalism in all its forms. One is apalled at how close to truth, some of these pages probably are. Yes, the storyline speaks to one geographical area and one socio-political community, and yet as I went through the pages, the paragraphs that left my face moist with tears were not the ones that shouted atrocities, rather the ones that would resonate with any woman today, in any part of the world, in any community, in any faith.

Whether it was the unshed tears of an incomplete love story, or the sorrow of a woman to lose her child even before the little one made an appearence in this world; whether it was the joy of the same woman to find opportunities where she could be a mother in ways that completed her very existence without ever giving birth; whether it was that friend who would kill for you; that friend who would die so you could live your dreams; at the end of the day this was a story of the best and worst facets of human relationships. No one is without frailties, least of all a woman, and yet what makes you look in awe at the 2 principal characters in the book is their very imperfection; their inability to probably fight their circumstances and yet their ability to be the best they can be.

The book makes you look at reality head on, makes you lock eyes with the most brutal beast that can get you down, some call it fate, some call it circumstances, I call it my reflection in my mirror. You truly are your own worst enemy if you let that reflection determine your image rather than the other way around.

Laila and Mariam - the 2 principal characters in the book, didn't live, they merely existed, but somehow in all that they went through, their spirit shone with a radiance that can only be a gift of the Divine. Yes, they are characters from a work of fiction, but as I started to look around me, I realized I have the privilege of knowing a lot of women who may not suffer the physical adversities that Laila and Mariam did, but mentally they could have been reduced to a shell of a human being. Yet these women not only survived but have done so with pride, dignity, with their heads held high. We"

The Perks of Being a Wallflower,0671027344,Stephen Chbosky,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"I would give you a summary of this fantastic book, but I don't want to give too much away. It's basically about a boy and his first year in high school. That's the one thing young readers need to watch out for because (I'm sorry to say) high school isn't exactly... uhmm... appropriate all the time, as shown in this book. The Perks of Being a Wallflower has very deep, easy to connect with characters and a plot that won't let you put the book down. Because of it's high school setting I wouldn't recommend this book for people under 13, but if you think you can handle the story without your parents flipping out too much, than go for it, cause this book will leave you with 100 hundred that aren't even yours. There are parts where you WILL cry (I guarantee it), parts where you will want to scream at the top of your lungs and not care who stares at you, and parts that will throw a smile on your face....not PUT a smile on ur face but that smile will THROW itself there.

"Ender's Game (Ender's Saga, #1)",0812550706,Orson Scott Card,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Awesomeness1,"I've seen this book in libraries, on best-of lists, and pretty much everywhere. But I've always dismissed it because of the cover and the premise which just seemed corny and something meant for 14-yr-old StarWars fans. So I was surprised when I saw my math teacher reading it. My math teacher is pretty, in her early 20's, and a conservative Bible-thumper, so I was curious to what she saw in it. Once I see somebody with a book in their hands, I become very nosy. Her rave review convinced me to read it. 

What can I say about this book is that it's very fun and entertaining. I read it in one day. The sci-fi itself was pretty basic, and the most interesting part for me was Ender's trials at Battle School. Even though I had trouble following the null gravity battles. I did not understand Ender's explanation at all. It seems I would not be fit for Battle School :( 

The most unbelievable part for me was the age of these kids. They were very young, yet talked like your average adult. I understand they were supposed to be genius's and everyone was chosen as the best in something, but the only I saw that in Ender. I wish I could have known the other characters more. 

The ""twist"" ending didn't surprise me as much as the final chapter did. It just seemed so completely different from the rest of the book. I'm not sure whether or like it or not. This book definitely made me think in places. 

Overall, I recommend it to sci-fi and non sci-fi fans alike. I'm interested to read the sequels to see what happens to their universe afterward, if I can find them at the library. The library has a nasty habit of only carrying some books in a series- and never the ones I want."
"Ender's Game (Ender's Saga, #1)",0812550706,Orson Scott Card,Barnes and Noble,4.5,JGolomb,"I'm not sure how I've never made the time to read Orson Scott Card's ""Ender's Game"". It came to my attention about 15 years ago because of it's prescient inclusion of something like the Internet - a supercomputing, connected and communication experience. Viewing Ender's ""desk"" through the lens of 2010, one can't help but also applaud Card's anticipation of the iPad.

The book is not standard sci-fi fare. Oh, it has its aliens (called ""buggers"" throughout the book), space- ships, travel, and battles, but it has much more than that. It has a unique depth. After reading it, I see now why schools are including it on their reading lists.

Ender is a genius. A six-year-old genius. It becomes clear early in the book that Ender's intelligence is ridiculously off the charts, even by the standards of Card's fictional future. Card's mastery is on full display in how deep and dimensional he's able to make the characters. Like many children who have some distinguishing characteristic, whether it's a good or bad, Ender finds those characteristics under attack. He's very withdrawn, insecure and closed off to most of the real world. I couldn't help but feel Ender's claustrophobic view of his world.I couldn't help but feel his anger, frustration and outrage.

I'm looking forward to reading more on Ender Wiggin. But like Ender, I need to step away for a while. I need some fresh air. I need to stretch out and catch my breath before I re-enter Ender's game...and Orson Scott Card's world."

I am only sorry that I waited so long to read this gem. Card has kicked off his Ender Wiggin series in grand fashion here. With all the sclock coming out of hollywood these days, it would be nice to see a faithful screen adaptation of this novel- it could not go wrong. Truly an original story with gripping characters and an engaging plot. I could hardly put it down."
Frankenstein,0141439475,"Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Maurice Hindle",Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"This is a very misunderstood story that sparked a concept that took on a life of it's own.  There is no scary castle, no hunchback, or villigars with pitch forks!  It is a story not about a monster but about what could happen when man kind tries to play creator.  You end up feeling sorry for the creature."
Frankenstein,0141439475,"Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Maurice Hindle",Barnes and Noble,4,jenmaynard,"Often considered the first science fiction novel, Mary Shelley had the creative spark for Frankenstein at the age of 18 and first published it as a 22-year-old. A story inspired by other gothic writings, contemporary scientific theories, and by tragedies in her own life (the death of her young child, a father who had disowned her), not to mention her poet husband Percy Shelley (who would drown the following year) and the philosophies of other poets in her young and influential circle of friends, this novel is a thought-provoking and ground-breaking work that has inspired countless stories about our desire to overcome death and our search for what it means to be human. It's not your modern horror thriller or what is generally depicted in film (instead of grunts, Frankenstein's real monster is eloquently tragic), the plot is often plodding, and some current readers might not find this a good read. But for those who enjoy a more philosophically centered gothic tale, Frankenstein is immortal."
Frankenstein,0141439475,"Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Maurice Hindle",Barnes and Noble,4,songcatchers,"My first thought on completing Frankenstein was this: I love this book! I really didn't know what to expect when I began reading this. We've all seen Frankenstein and his ""monster"" portrayed through numerous media outlets and I wasn't sure how any of these compared to the original story created by Mary Shelley. From page one I was drawn in and riveted by the narrative. I was hooked on Victor Frankenstein with his ambition and his creation who showed such strong emotions. Frankenstein's creation is an infantile being born into the body of a monster. We watch as this ""monster"" teaches himself writing, language, geography, history. He reads from Milton's Paradise Lost and from Plutarch's Lives. Learning brought such joy to him. It was so sad to see the ""monster's"" attitude toward man (and especially Frankenstein in particular) go from such love and delight to dark feelings and hate. Frankenstein and his race pushed the ""monster"" away and shunned him because he didn't look like them. They never gave him a chance to prove his worth among them. I believe it was society that created the ""monster"", and not soley Victor, but it was Victor who reaped the punishment. Frankenstein, the novel, brings up some thought provoking questions dealing with science and life and what it means to be human. You'll have to read the book yourself and draw your own conclusions.""So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of Frankenstein-more, far more, will I achieve: treading in the steps already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation."""
"The Host (The Host, #1)",0316068047,Stephenie Meyer,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"This was just the greatest book!  I actually liked it quite a bit more than the Twilight series - those just felt a little too young for me.  (Not to say they aren't very good.)  The characters in this book are amazing!  I got to love them so much, which is almost strange because I was so angry with most of them at first (for the way they treated Melanie/Wanderer.)  The plot had twist after twist and I couldn't get enough.  Despite its being over 600 pages, I read it in a few days.  I just couldn't wait to know what happened next!  Highly HIGHLY recommened!  (And I can't believe Kristina Marrick wrote a review on here!!!  I loved her book too!)"
"The Host (The Host, #1)",0316068047,Stephenie Meyer,Barnes and Noble,4.4,DinaFelice,"Stephanie Meyer does it again with a story as deeply compelling as those in her more well-known Twilight series. This time we are on an Earth that has been--almost--completely overrun with an invasion of parasitic aliens called 'Souls'. But these Souls aren't the bad guys. 

The book is told from the perspective of Wanderer, a Soul who has lead a varied life on numerous planets and yet has never found emotions as strong as those she feels in her new human host body. But there is a problem: this host belonged to a human named Melanie, a young woman who spent years fighting the occupation. And unlike Wanderer's previous hosts, who quietly faded into the background of memories, Melanie is not ready to go away.

As the story unfolds, the readers find themselves rooting for both Wanderer and Melanie. We want Melanie to escape the prison she is in yet we want Wanderer to be freed of the burden of another voice in her head. And we desperately want both of them to find Jared, Melanie's human boyfriend, a man they both share a romantic love for and Jamie, Melanie's human brother, a boy they both share a maternal love for. And as they learn not to hate each other while finding themselves in new and potentially dangerous situations, we want a happy ending for both of them, though that seems quite impossible.

As in her other books, Meyer draws each of her characters with strengths and flaws, with true humanity, both the good and the bad that exists in each of us. From the central characters to those on the periphery, we understand why they do the things they do and sympathise even with the monsters. The complicated love triangles and the thrilling scenes where fear of discovery is near help to round out this amazing book.

I literally found it difficult to put this book down. I kept reading until the wee hours of the morning, then picked it up as soon as I woke up (thank goodness it was the weekend). I finished it yesterday and I have begun re-reading it today.

If you liked the Twilight series, you will like this. If you like this, you will like the Twilght series. The things that make a story truly compelling--great characters, facinating plot, danger, joy, sacrifice, love in all its many forms--are Meyer's forte. I find myself anxiously awaiting her next book, whatever it will be."

There are so many unexpected twists and turns, its an over all great, easy read.  It will make you laugh, cry, and just be totally entertained!   You have to have real creativity to think a story like this up!!"
Looking for Alaska,0142402516,John Green,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"I feel heavy. And empty. 

I have read the book. It is over. For me, anyways. 

This makes me sad.

The reviews of this book make me sad, and also a little bit angry because when people say that a book like this is 'amazing,' I think that they do not understand.

This book was enormous.

Today I told a friend that I was reading a beautiful book called 'The Fault in Our Stars,' but that she had better not read it, because it was mine.

I understand Hazel.

This book was enormous, but it came and went very quietly. I do not want it to be a sensation. I do not want it to be sensational for anyone but me. I do not want it to be anything. I do not want it to be made into a movie.

I want it to be loved.

I am very conflicted.

I do not want people to read it who will not understand.

I think I understand.

I feel like I am breaking it. Everything.

But this is how I feel.

I wish that I had not purchased this book electronically, because then I could take the copy that I do not own wherever I go, pages folded, spine cracking, soft cover bent and loved and worn and used and perfect.

This book was enormous, and yet it came and went... so quietly. 

It is a quiet book.

After.

You cry. You laugh. 

But the after.

It is a quiet book.

Thank you, John.

Looking for Alaska,0142402516,John Green,Barnes and Noble,4.5,LastCapitalist,"If you have not read this book, I recommend immediately you get up and go to your nearest library and get this book. This book will blow your mind, one of the books I almost teared up in. The author greatest achievements in this book is how he builds gut wrenching tension after every chapter with the 100 day till and so on. And when you finally hit the climax you will be in disbelief. Oh and be prepared to fall in love with the most diverse and compelling characters ever written."
Looking for Alaska,0142402516,John Green,Barnes and Noble,4.5,AMorgan721,"I was pleasantly surprised by Looking for Alaska.  For me, it started out very young and teenager-ish, which is probably because.well, it's a book about a bunch of teenagers, doing very teenage things.  For a while I was thinking that I was just listening to a book that was going to be basically just that, teenagers doing teenage things; drinking, smoking, sex, and tormenting each other (yes, all of the above are included in this book).  I figured there was going to be some great disaster and a lesson learned and wam-bam, you've got a book.  The thing is, the book received several great reviews that I just couldn't give up on it.  People saying how great a book it was - usually ""people"" do know what they are talking about.well at least some of the time.

It took half the book - and then it happened, the great disaster I was talking about before.  The thing is, it's much greater than you wanted or expected.  And John Green is a genius, because by this time, you're laughing and enjoying yourself with these characters, so the blow is not just to the characters, but you feel it too.

So, no, this book is not about a bunch of teenagers, doing teenage-y things, no matter how much of it is included in the book.  It's a book about life. It's a book about very young people attempting to discover the meaning of life, love, true friendship, having fun, tragedy, depression, and even God.  I was so impressed with some of the things that the author included about God, and religion in general, and not just one but several different religions.  I am a Christian, and while he was simply skimming the surface of religions and religious beliefs, John Green nailed some things on the head, or at least included things that nailed it on the head.  My favorite religious section: the discussion about the lady (I can't remember names right now - and since this is an audiobook, no book to reference) who wanted to destroy Heaven and Hell because she wanted people to love God not because he could get them into Heaven, keep them out of Hell, but because God is God!  

Many of the reviews I had read said that due to the mature nature of some of the stuff in the book, it probably isn't for young teenagers.  I would have to agree.  There are moments when I felt like smoking and drinking and even sex was not glorified exactly, but it seemed normal.  And it is, somewhat, but as adults and parents, we should attempt to move and motivate for it not to be normal.  On the flip side, the consequences of some of these actions are shown throughout the book."
Sense and Sensibility,0141439661,"Jane Austen, Tony Tanner, Ros Ballaster",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"In Jane Austen¿s Sense and Sensibility, the classic tale of love and its consequences is told through the lives of the young and beautiful Dashwood sisters. Marianne, an imprudent and impulsive young lady, immediately falls in love with the handsome, yet unpredictable Mr. Willoughby, scandalously displaying her affection for him. Elinor, although always reserved and collected, also falls in love, but unlike her sister, keeps her affection for her admirer concealed even from those she dearly loves. Through the opposite characterization of the two main characters, Austen criticizes the folly of not leading a balanced lifestyle, whether it is cold and distant or spontaneous and brash. The novel also depicts the troubles caused by love in a society where wealth and social standing are top priorities. Through a variety of characters ranging from a frantic, gluttonous sister, to a humble and kind colonel, Austen condemns the social institutions of her time that encouraged the priority of wealth and status when forming an opinion of a person. Throughout the novel, readers are hooked, held in suspense as they eagerly await to discover the results of the Dashwoods¿ adventures with love. Humorous, heartbreaking, and humbling, Austen combines lessons of life, love, and society defining Sense and Sensibility as a classic."
Sense and Sensibility,0141439661,"Jane Austen, Tony Tanner, Ros Ballaster",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Paige2017,I really love all of Jane Austen's books but Sense and Sensibility is one of my favorites!  It is an endearing story of two sisters who finally get their true happiness!  If only this happened in real life!

"The Devil Wears Prada (The Devil Wears Prada, #1)",0307275558,Lauren Weisberger,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Anonymous,"I finally got around to renting the movie from the video store long after it left the new releases shelves and found it hilarious--so I was eager to pick up a copy of the book from my local library.  As an avid reader, I almost always find the book to be ten times better than the movie because movies are limited by a number of parameters, namely ""time.""That being said, this is one of those occasions where the movie is so much better than the book.  The book was simply far too long, filled with page after page after page of endless errand running for a rude boss. We get it already!  The movie was able to get the point across much more dramatically AND QUICKLY by simply showing the boss toss one coat after another (indicating day after day) onto her poor assistant's desk. There were simply too many times I dozed off reading this book, but I labored on. The endless complaints about the useless errand running also got to me after a while, to the point where I simply didn't like the main character all that much anymore.  She didn't seem to have any self respect, and the explanation that she was doing this as a means to be able to pick anywhere she wanted to work after a year didn't seem plausible.  Enough said--rent the movie."
"The Devil Wears Prada (The Devil Wears Prada, #1)",0307275558,Lauren Weisberger,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,I did quite enjoy this book but not one character was a rounded three dimensional character. Not at one point in the book do you ever find yourself rooting for Andy or feeling any kind of emotion for that matter. On the surface this book is a good with a good idea but that is just the problem the book remains surface.
"The Devil Wears Prada (The Devil Wears Prada, #1)",0307275558,Lauren Weisberger,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Christina92,"Andrea Sachs, a recent college graduate, lands a job as an assistant to the editor in chief of Runway Magazine, Miranda Priesly. Little did she know that her boss would be the most demanding, overbearing, ruthless person in the world.
 
The author's style in the novel is simplistic.  The narrator is Andrea who takes the reader on a whirlwind adventure into her daily life. The plot line is predictable and the diction is colloquial. This book was entertaining due to the humorous language that the narrator uses.

If you are a recent college grad or have been there before, you will be able to relate to Andrea.  She struggles with making ends meet on a new college grad income while working in an industry that is obsessed with fashion and perfection.  Andrea also learns some important lessons around friendship by letting fear dictate her work career because of how intimidating Miranda was with her.  Her constant fear and 'marriage' to her work got in the way of her relationships.  As a result, she lost some trust with her friends, broke up with her boyfriend, and weakened relations with her friends.   

Lauren Wiesberger graduated from Cornell University then moved to New York to pursue her career as a magazine writer. However, for six months prior to this, she spent time in Europe backpacking with her boyfriend. When she retuned from her trip she realized she had no money and no place to live. So she applied for an assistant position at Vogue magazine to the editor in chief. Her boss had bizarre, demanding requests and made her work like a mad woman to the point where she became isolated with the world around her. She eventualy quit the position and she became a freelance journalist.  Lauren's own personal life is seen through the storyline in this book.

This novel is an easy read book that has simplistic word choice. It is also an escape from the everyday kind of book. If you like fashion and humor The Devil Wears Prada is an excellent choice for you."
The Odyssey,0143039954,"Homer, Robert Fagles, E.V. Rieu, Frédéric Mugler, Bernard Knox",Barnes and Noble,3.9,ZebraStripe,"This is an amazing translation; the language is flawless, almost poetic. And, of course, a timless classic. I had to read this book for my English Honors course and expected boredom. However, I was pleasently surprised-- I enjoyed it! It's the story of the Greek hero, Odysseus, after the Trojan War. On the start of his voyage home, he provokes Poseidon, god of the sea. Thus, releasing the god's wrath. Odysseus faces many obstacles, on account of Poseidon's anger, including an encounter with Cyclops, Circe, and the Sirens, and a journey to Hades' Underworld. I would recommend this book to anyone who appreciates classic literature. Though the language does take time to become accustomed to, the hardest part of this book is the vast amount of characters. I recommend composing a list of all the gods and goddesses in addition to demigods and heroes."

But as I read it I became enchanted of the way the words are written and the characters, and the plot! I loved it so much I kept on reading, and before I knew it I was finished with it! An incredible tale written in ancient times that tells the story of an exiled soldier trying to return home with many sinister obstacles bloking his way.

Saint-Exupery's tale is absolutely charming and full of wisdom.

I bought this as a gift for a friend who was losing a dear pet.  I still gave it to her, but I was disappointed by this translation.

Unfortunately, the translation by Richard Howard lacks some of the heart of the tale, especially in many key places.  For example, the phrase ""L'essentiel est invisible pour les yeux."" is translated ""Anything essential is invisible to the eyes."" instead of ""What is essential is invisible to the eyes.""  or  ""The essential part is invisible to the eyes.""

I much prefer the translation by Katherine Woods."

I received my first copy over twenty years later, from ""the second great love of my life"", to thank me for opening her heart.

The tenets set forward by Antoine de Saint-Exupery stayed with me and helped strengthen and nurture relationships over the decades.  I reminded my friend of her gift and its lessons several years ago as she was dying of cancer.

Then, just a few weeks ago, a new friend found herself in the same position:  A former lover, who remained a close friend for decades, was dying of cancer.  So I sent her a copy of this book to help bring her some clarity.

Perhaps it is true that everything you ever really needed to know you learned in kindergarten, which is why this so-called ""children's book"" is worth revisiting at any point in your life."

The mother doesn't care enough to be a true mom, and the father is too busy getting drunk to care in a fatherly way. Which leaves the children with a lot to be desired. In a quest for independence and to find a way through life the children separate and it shows many different paths life can lead you down..It is truly an inspirational book, that shows you don't need someone always and to never give up. I really recommend this book."
The Glass Castle,074324754X,Jeannette Walls,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"THIS IS AN OUTSTANDING, WELL WRITTEN BOOK. The Glass Castle by Jeannette Wall is the type of book that makes you want to give your parents a hug and thank them for being such wonderful parents, no matter how bad they were. Wall was raised by free spirits who want their children to become toughened by life and believe firmly in survival of the fittest. Her mother wants to be an artist and not to be bothered by the inconvenience of feeding and caring for her children. Her father is brilliantly smart but also a vicious drunk. Every time I thought that her childhood couldn't get any worse, I would turn the page. Which is worse? The Christmas he lit the entire Christmas tree on fire (on purpose) destroying their presents or the time he chased his pregnant wife with the car through the desert at night until he pinned her against a rock wall. Wall's story of perserverance through adversity is inspiring and amazing. You can't help but admire the courage it took to survive what she did and accomplish everything she has since. I finished it last night, and today I realized I was a bit sad that I didn't have any more of their crazy life stories to read about!"

Readers in my course, both young and middle aged, are held by the divided souls in this book, by its perils, defenses for neglect, overcoming, awful truths, painful secrets, shame, sarcasm, love always love, wit, and pluck. Its style holds us, and its saga of overcoming moves all. You will put the book down upon finishing, but you will never be able to quit the Walls' family. 

Jeannette Walls has one amazing heart. I am honored that she has shared it with us."

"Jurassic Park (Jurassic Park, #1)",030734813X,Michael Crichton,Barnes and Noble,4.6,coloradogirl14 on LibraryThing,"My favorite Crichton novel and one of my favorite novels of all time, mainly because the suspense is palpable, and most importantly, realistic.  What I love about Crichton's novels is that he is able to not only explain complicated scientific and technological concepts in layman's terms, but he is also able to make these concepts believable without insulting the reader's intelligence.  I was also impressed with the philosophical elements of the story, although I imagine some readers might consider this a too-obvious intrusion of the author's opinions.  Normally, I get frustrated with authors who attempt this, but somehow it works with Crichton and he has an interesting perspective on the inherent power of scientific discovery.  A fantastic techno-thriller and a fantastic story overall.  I've read Jurassic Park about twenty times and I plan to read it twenty more in the future."

The Giving Tree,0060256656,Shel Silverstein,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"This book 'THE GIVING TREE' by Shel Silverstein is a great book to read to children. It is a sad story but the lesson that it teaches is really valuable. This story speaks about the unconditional love the tree had towards the boy.When the boy was little he would gather the leaves,  climb up on her trunk and swing from her  branches. She would let him eat her apples and give him shade when he was tired. As he grows older he completely forgets about the tree. He remembers her only when he needs her.But the tree keeps giving him whatever the boy wanted. The man sells all the apples and even cuts her down to build his house. Even then the tree keeps giving whatever he wanted. When I read this book to my children , my daughter who is going to 3rd grade said that it was very mean on the boy's part to keep asking for more and more from the tree. My daughter hated when the boy cut the tree down to build his house. She was in tears when she read that page in the story. She told me that she will never be as mean as that boy . She was infact angry that the boy did not thank the tree even once. I think that this book helped my daughter learn the importance of give and take. I highy recomend readers to read this book to their young ones and also teachers to keep this book in their classrooms. I think it is a great book to share."

A Time to Kill,0385338600,John Grisham,Barnes and Noble,4.4,JessLucy,"Horrifying and somehow beautiful at the same time; Grisham tells the story of a family shattered and a town rocked by a horrific crime committed against a child. The trial Grisham describes is fascinating and heart-breaking in its process. The movie was good but the book is truly a work of art. The author has a skill for making the reader feel like he/she's actually right there during the trial. Grisham has outdone himself with this one! I also enjoyed The Chamber and The Partner by the same author. If you like John Grisham, you may also enjoy: Philip Margolin, Tami Hoag (Ashes to Ashes, Dust to Dust and a Thin Dark Line especially, and Michael Connelly."

A Time to Kill,0385338600,John Grisham,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"A Time to Kill by John Grisham is an excellent novel. The story takes place in the small town of Clanton, Mississippi. The story covers an uneasy relationship between blacks and whites. A black man named Carl Hailey kills two white men who are on trial for the rape of his little girl. The irony is that Carl Hailey is defended by a white attorney named Jake Brigance. The novel contains humor and action. The story is moving and emotional. I like that Jake Brigance is a young, white attorney who does what he feels is the right thing to do. He is so determined to keep Carl Hailey out of jail and let him return to his family that he suffers consequences in his own marriage and within the town. Some of the people around him treat him differently than before he made the decision to be Carl Hailey's lawyer. They don't understand why Jake wants to help a black man stay out of prison. My favorite part of the plot and the main point of the novel is that Carl Hailey would do anything to take revenge against the people who hurt his daughter, even if it means that he will have to spend the rest of his life in prison. Every parent would feel the same way. If my daughter was raped and tortured, I would want to kill those guys too. The obstacle is to encourage the jury to realize this. They would have done the same thing if they were in Carl Hailey's place. They need to look past the color of his skin and judge him on what he did. Although killing two men was wrong, his intensions were right. Carl Hailey did it for his daughter. The love that he has for his daughter is extremely touching."
Night (The Night Trilogy #1),0374500010,"Elie Wiesel, Marion Wiesel",Barnes and Noble,4.6,SarahAnn09,"NIGHT by Elie Wiesel is a piercing account of the horrors of concentration camp, which impressed an incredible toll both internally and externally on his being.  As a young adolescent, he is ripped from his home, plummeted to the depths of suffering, and driven to the edge of his own humanity.  Mr. Wiesel openly shares with readers the tremendous weight of these experiences etched within his soul.  His courage in doing so should be lauded.

From Mr. Wiesel we can learn that regardless of the burden from the sins of others imposed upon us and our own sins, it is possible to endure - and even to help others do so.  

In that vein, I would recommend another memoir to readers of NIGHT - called A BEAUTIFUL WORLD, written by Gregg Milligan.   It is a book you will not be able to put down - a deeply moving account of the indomitable human spirit as seen in the heart of a young child subjected to severe physical, mental and sexual abuse. 
   
In the author's own words, he shares his story to help others 'buckle down and bear the ride' through their own hell - and know that they are not alone.   A BEAUTIFUL WORLD is an incredible testament to the perseverance of hope.  Exquisitely written and heart wrenching, it is an unforgettable story.

Both A BEAUTIFUL WORLD and NIGHT offer readers a chance to adjust their own perspective on suffering through the examples of both authors.  Though they have suffered greatly and will never leave this experience behind, they will not allow it to end them either.   

Further, both authors possess the incredible courage to reach out and share their stories, giving of themselves for the benefit of others.  The astounding resiliency shown in that act alone speaks volumes of them as human beings -- and the words they press to paper will ever live on in the hearts of those that read them."
Night (The Night Trilogy #1),0374500010,"Elie Wiesel, Marion Wiesel",Barnes and Noble,4.6,OswaldoLMS,"I'm amazed by what humans are capable of doing to one another and this book shows how devastating the cruelty can be for some. Night is the story of Elie Weisel, who spent his life during the Holocaust and knew how  people were treated in the concentration camps.I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn how people were during the Holocaust."
Night (The Night Trilogy #1),0374500010,"Elie Wiesel, Marion Wiesel",Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"The book Night is a terrifyingly honest retelling of a holocausts survivor's story. Elie Wiesel, who was a teen when he and his whole town were forced into the camps, shows what really happened. He spoke of how everyone reacted, and showed how desperate everyone truly got when they realized how much trouble they were in. It offered a look inside the mind of one of the victims, and showed the constant battle they fought with themselves. Also, it put in his own experiences, showing how he felt during it. 
To start with, Night really captured the nature of humans perfectly. Some of the Nazis were cruel, while a few were simply there because they had to be. Some prisoners were helpful and nice, some were aggressive and selfish. He showed all sides of the people, that they're not all the same. 
Plus, the book also shows how his beliefs changed over time. As he was forced onto the cattle cars, he called himself religious. After years of starvation, abuse, and harsh conditions, he began to lose faith. By the time he escaped, he believed in only one person, himself. He let readers in on all he was thinking, not just what he was witnessing. 
Also, the novel is just well written. The flow is impeccable, with each even flowing seamlessly into the next one. The details Elie poured into this story really shine through. All of the sentences have a meaning, and aren't just some made up stuff to make the story seem more interesting. He turned his life story into a beautiful piece of literature.
In addition, he talked about his father and about how hard he tried to help him. Plus, he even admitted to sort of feeling a wave of relief when his father passed away. He loved his father, but after constantly helping him as they both grew weaker and weaker, as well as doing hard labor to survive, it's no wonder he felt a weight lifted off his shoulders after his father's passing.
To sum it all up, Night is a painful, but beautiful story. It somehow managed to capture the essence of desperation, and showed this off with ease. It also showed his own battles with faith. Elie remained truthful throughout; contributing to what makes this novel so breathtaking. He didn't shy away from the things he felt, he showed them to the world. Additionally, the book is just a magnificent piece of literature. Night is definitely a book worth reading."
Paper Towns,014241493X,John Green,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"The first book I read by John Green was an Abundance of Katherines. I was hooked. This brilliant man who I knew through Nerdfighting and Brotherhood 2.0 videos had a completely different, and yet the same, side. He could write far better than almost any modern author I'd read- and that was only his second book. I read An Abundance of Katherines three times after I got it, and promptly bought a copy for myself. Then, I heard about Paper Towns. I had to read it. If it were even half as good as his other books, then it would be a miracle. But it wasn't. It was exponentially more amazing. 

I read the whole book in one day. I checked it out from the library in the morning at school and read it under my desk in class all day long. In seventh period, I read the last sentence, having heard nothing of class all day, closed the book, amazed, and excused myself to go deliver the book to one of my friends, who had begged me to lend her the book when I finished it, in her math class. I couldn't wait to pass it on. 

Everything about Paper Towns screams MASTERPIECE like nothing I've ever read. In the first fifteen minutes after the final punctuation, Paper Towns beat out each and every one of my favorite books, some of which I've called my favorite since elementary school, and became my favorite book. 

The characters are real, alive, vibrant. You can feel the story and live it along with them. John Green makes you cry one moment and laugh your ass off the next, all in one fluid motion. This book... is amazing. I feel like I've known Q my whole life. Hell, I'm even ordering a Black Santa online. 

If you haven't yet, buy this book. Read it. You'll never, ever regret it. 

Everything about Paper Towns is just beautiful. I can't say it enough. My way of thinking was changed. My way of writing was changed. My way of talking was changed. My way of life was changed. This book, though it is printed on paper, is NOT a paper book, to be passed by. By no means 2-dimensional, this book is like the V for Vendetta of literature- everyone should experiance it. Paper Towns changed my life, and my perspective of modern literature. 

Buy this book."
Paper Towns,014241493X,John Green,Barnes and Noble,4.4,laughing_in_the_rain,"When I first started reading this book I was completely in love with it. It was one of those books where you laugh out loud, cry, and think a lot. I think we can all relate to some of the situations in this books. It was really amazing. It kind of teaches us that we can chase somebody across the United States, but in the end our fantasies won't become real. I really liked the characters in this story. I would be reading in class and just bust out laughing. It was really good and now it's one of my all-time favorite books."
Paper Towns,014241493X,John Green,Barnes and Noble,4.4,asamum,"The story has so many layers it was like peeling the layers from an onion only to discover more layers underneath.

Written in 1st person narrative, from Quentin's (Q's) perspective. Q was surprisingly easy to relate to even in my female dominated household. Q epitomises the boy next door stereotype. A good student and all round nice guy. John Green makes geek/nerd sexy.

Margo & Q are tied together by a traumatic incident in their childhood. Although no longer friends, Q has had a crush on Margo from an early age.  Following their night of adventure and Margo's subsequent disappearance, Q has to analyse how well he knows/doesn't know Margo.

The notion that we are different versions of ourselves with different people really comes under scrutiny within the narrative. How well do we really know someone when we only see a single side of them. In the same context how well do we know ourselves, when we are different with different people. There are a complex set of psychological theories beautifully entwined in the plot. 

Making Q's parents psychiatrists in the story adds an extra dimension to the analysis. Elements of the nature versus nurture debate especially with the contrasts between Q's parents and Margo's.

The use of Walter Whitman's poem Leaves of Grass within the plot adds another layer to the story (see what I mean about peeling the layers of an onion). The analysis of the poem parallels the analysis of people within the plot.

Q evolves tremendously throughout the book. At the start he has always been on the periphery of his own life. Through his search for Margo, he discovers who he really is. I think that is why finding Margo became a compulsion for him, as he was also finding himself.

I adored John Green's writing style, the use of metaphors & similes were fantastic. Decay never sounded so good :0)

A story about growing-up, self discovery, endings & beginnings. The realisation that the world is a big place and we are just a small part of the whole. A highly recommended read :0)"
The Princess Bride ,0345418263,William Goldman,Barnes and Noble,4.4,DylanJames,"The story is without peer. For folks who loved the movie, the extra texture and detail provided by the book is very rewarding.

However, this ebook presentation is inexcusably poor.  What am I talking about? Every other edition of the Princess Bride uses typography to distinguish Goldman's voice from Morgenstern's.  This is important, because there are many interjections by Goldman. The first edition of the book used red type for Goldman's voice. Subsequent editions used italics. With the richness of an electronic screen available, what does this ebook do? Absolutely nothing is what it does. The book says ""All abridging remarks and other comments will be in this fancy italic type so you'll know."" It says this in exactly the same non-italic type of the rest of the book. Hopefully, being an electronic item, this error can be fixed, and existing copies will be updated.

This makes it appear that in the production chain of an eBook, or this one anyway, there wasn't a single person who cared about the content of Princess Bride. This is our future! Please take better care."
The Princess Bride ,0345418263,William Goldman,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Hockney,"This is a classic novel of adventure, romance, sword fighting, revenge, magic and very big rodents. Funnier than the film, and with better special effects. Goldman's radical editing of Morgenstern's epic will appeal to anyone with a love of adventure, but who read the unabridged versions of books such as Don Quixote and Moby Dick and found them boring beyond belief. All the good bits, indeed.
And the format's been fixed - Goldman's comentary is now in italics."
The Princess Bride ,0345418263,William Goldman,Barnes and Noble,4.4,AMHblogger,"Wow, where do I begin? Being a big fan of the movie and critical of adaptations, this book was as close to perfect as you could possibly get! I absolutely loved it! The movie stays very faithful to the book; and the book is purely awesome. The book even contained the aspect that the story was being read to a child by an adult. Goldman took it even a step further and created an entire storyline outside of the actual Princess Bride story. The whole idea of abridging the &ldquo;original&rdquo; story by Morgenstern was fictitious, but it had me believing it was the truth. It wasn&rsquo;t until after finishing the book, I looked it up on the internet and found out it was fake; it was all part of the story. Very creative, I must say.

Aside from that, the main story of The Princess Bride was exciting, funny, and touching. The characters were deep, witty, and likable. It contained a great balance of romance, action, suspense, and witty humor. If you enjoyed the movie, you&rsquo;ll cherish the book. It gives greater detail and background to various characters not seen in the movie. 

This has undoubtedly become my favorite book by far. To think another story could outdo it is absolutely....

....INCONCEIVABLE!!!"
The Outsiders,014038572X,S.E. Hinton,Barnes and Noble,4.7,lion_and_lamb28,Great book!! I read it in class and if i hadnt i would have missed out on alot. I couldnt put it down. The realism of it is incredible. I highly recomend is for a project or just for fun!
The Outsiders,014038572X,S.E. Hinton,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Anonymous,"S.E. Hinton's The Outsiders had to be one of the most moving teen reads ever written. This book can be read 100 times, and you'll still cry at parts and smile at other parts, even when you know what is going to happen.  
My good friend had first told me about this book and she started explaining how much she loved it and how it was about gangs, and I did a double take. At the moment, I thought she was crazy for obsessing over a book about gangs. Now, I see why she loves it so much. 
No one would ever think a book about Greasers and Socs would ever be this incredible. But it is, and the fact that Hinton had started writing this at the age of fifteen is amazing.
Incredible author and an incredible heart warming book that will live on forever."
The Outsiders,014038572X,S.E. Hinton,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Anonymous,"I had heard of The Outsiders before, and finally decided to read it on my own. I was absolutely stunned by how much it affected me. It is honestly the best book I have ever read, and this is coming from a die-hard Harry Potter fan. If you are going to read this, however, I would recommend reading the end in a private place, considering I literally sobbed for about twenty minutes, something no book has ever made me do. It's amazing!"
"The Maze Runner (Maze Runner, #1)",0385737947,James Dashner,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Hanna_thereckless,"I absolutely loved The Maze Runner. I first heard about it through an internet ad. It asked, ""Like the Hunger Games? Then you should read The Maze Runner."" It drew my attention because The Hunger Games is one of my most favorite books. So I started reading the ""preview"" of The Maze Runner on Barnes and Noble's website. There's something to be said for a book that I couldn't stay away from after the first sentence. I neglected my work and stared at my computer screen, reading. When I reached the end of the preview, I bought the ebook because I had to know what happened. It is a fast paced, action-packed adventure that completely sucks the reader in. From the very first sentence, I was simply dropped into the story; everything is from the main character's point of view. You only see and hear what he sees and hears. It was exciting, and I felt as if I was there.  
	 It is true that the characters could have been more deeply developed; they were certainly lacking in personality depth. Also, The Maze Runner is quite violent in parts: there is death and insanity and truly terrifying monsters. It is part of a new genre of books, all exploring the possible futures of this world. It is not a light read; it will have you up at night. However, if you loved The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, this is a book that you will enjoy just as much. I definitely recommend it."
"The Maze Runner (Maze Runner, #1)",0385737947,James Dashner,Barnes and Noble,4.4,brandyMD,"This book reminded me very much of The Hunger Games (FANTASTIC book & trilogy!)  This is written for teens, however I am an adult and both my 13 year old son and myself have now read it and thought it was hard to put down.  This is definitely one where you need to use your brain matter and think of the options involved.  You cannot help but feel compassion for the characters and your sense of emotion goes full speed.  As my son says, 'you feel like you are right there with them'.  (I must say, all of the same can be said for The Hunger Games as well)

Sure hope he gets the next book out sooner than later-it will definitely leave you thinking and ready for the next one ASAP."

I found myself thinking through all of the situations with the main characters. It was the last thing i thought about at night, and the first in the morning. This is definately a book that will make you ask yourself, ""what if that happemed to me?"" This was a great book and i definately reccomemnd it."
"Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (Freakonomics, #1)",0061234001,"Steven D. Levitt, Stephen J. Dubner",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"This book is a general interest book- and it certainly is interesting. The book, for anyone looking for an entertaining read, will like it. In a nutshell, the book takes a look at all sorts of things in society, from crack gangs to parenting, and then attempts to make sense of them by applying econonmic principles. According to the book, economics is really the study of incentives, and so using this kind of angle, the book comes up with answers to why things work the way they do. A book that's hard to put down, I'm sure many readers will enjoy it. Also recommend The Sixty-Second Motivator for a more simplistic explanation of what motivates people and gives them incentives to do what they do."
"Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (Freakonomics, #1)",0061234001,"Steven D. Levitt, Stephen J.

"Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (Freakonomics, #1)",0061234001,"Steven D. Levitt, Stephen J. Dubner",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Pass,"Freakonomics provides the reader with the chance to take a new perspective on many different topics. It answers a seemingly complex question of why exactly drug dealers live with their mothers and shows how gangs are the reason why. This book is one that you would not want to put down and will want to read it through to the end. I would suggest that everybody reads this book and learn from it some very hard lessons. A chapter in the book describes how criminologists incorrectly found the answer to the 1990's crime rate drop and how that drop is linked to the legalization of abortion. Levitt and Dubner also show how everybody responds to an incentive, comparing the prices real estate agents get for their house versus their clients; also providing why a sumo wrestler is like a school teacher. This book shows the reader the hidden side of decision-making and how the economy works. It provides an insight to the world of economists and into the world of both psychology and sociology. From the book you can learn ways to bring patterns out of data (even though this wasn't an intention of the book) which is a very valuable skill to have. Another thing to learn is that common, conventional wisdom is mostly made up of lies and is created by ""experts"" in their own interest. It explains how those experts manipulate people by using their ignorance against them, and hopefully will teach the reader not to believe everything they hear. This book is one that every person needs to read at some point in their life, as it provides many different answers to life's questions and presents the method for answering those. Those methods can be used to answer your own personal questions and will help you out during your entire life."
The Secret Garden,0517189607,Frances Hodgson Burnett,Barnes and Noble,4,moniema,"I am 9 years old, about the same age as Mary the main character in the book. When I first got the book I thought I would not be interested in it. However, I kept on reading and it got really good.  The story is very well told, it is easy to follow, the vocabulary is not very hard. You just have to be patient and towards the middle the story gets very interesting. Also at the end of the book there are questions about the story that makes you wonder how you would feel in Mary's situation.   My mom felt that this book would be a good introduction to reading good literature, and I agree. I felt it was very educational and appropriate for my reading level. I would recommend it to any girl or boy that is ready for some serious reading."
The Secret Garden,0517189607,Frances Hodgson Burnett,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"The first time I read this book must have been when I was in fourth grade, and I loved it so much and read it many times after that. I had to do a book report and that was when my dad recommended this book to me. I was reluctant to read this book at first, however, I was quickly captured in the magic of this book. It truly opened a door to a new world of a journey in a land of Classic books. I cried while reading this book.. because I'm also very emotional.   It's about an arrogant, selfish, and lonely girl who discovers a secret world behind a door. Gradually through the stories she learns to smile, laugh, and be a child. She makes friends for the first time and becomes more bright and glowing then ever! If you don't read this book... you will regret it... Read it and enjoy!!! :)"

One Hundred Years of Solitude,0060531045,"Gabriel García Márquez, Gregory Rabassa",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"One Hundred Years of Solitude is the most interesting novel I have read in a long time.  I was immediately drawn into the character development in the novel. Marquez tells the story in a way that makes the reader relate to characters that are strongly flawed. The family depicted is surprisingly realistic  although their lives are at times abnormally crazed. The magical, and at times tragic, events that occur through the story do not hinder the heart of the characters. The refreshing use of mystical realism is appropriately placed throughout the sometimes dark writing. While I was reading the novel, I couldn¿t help but smile at the witty details that were strategically used throughout. Although this book may be seen as dense and even random at times, the pure heart of the story shines through. When I first found the book, I was not sure if I would enjoy it, because it is a change from the usual novels I read. Once I completed the story, I was pleased that I chose to read this important piece of literature. After reading this novel, I feel that my views on society have changed. I would definitely recommend this book, because it is a worthy read."
One Hundred Years of Solitude,0060531045,"Gabriel García Márquez, Gregory Rabassa",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"First and foremost, the prose in which this book is written is some of the most beautiful phrasing I have ever read. It reads extremely fast, but you have to be careful not to miss something. One paragraph can be three pages long, but one line in that paragraph can be something so powerful that it just tugs at your heart, so while it reads fast, also give it time to sink in. I've read reviews on here about how others have thought the characters were bizarre, or the events were explicit or unbelievable. It's magical realism, folks. This is part of the story, part of the heritage of the author and their nature of literature, and it's the biggest part of the story that brings the impossible to life. It's imagination, it's devotion, strength, love, lust, pain, jealousy and strife. I think that when most authors set out to write a book, they hope to capture just one of those feelings. Marquez captures them all, and he does it in such a way that no one else ever has before. I'm not going to give any details of the book. The pages speak for themselves. I only read these reviews after I read the book, just out of curiosity. I highly recommend not reading the book's description or anything that could potentially ruin the story. Just turn to page one, begin to read, and feel the power of this author's magic. It's truly overpowering."
One Hundred Years of Solitude,0060531045,"Gabriel García Márquez, Gregory Rabassa",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"Although I haven't finished the novel yet (I'm half way through), I can understand the good and bad reviews. The author does have an interesting way of telling the story. My only complaint is some of the twisted behavior of many of the characters  I guess that's a part of the 'life changing' part of reading the novel.I liked the beginning and it does show the progression of civilization. It also examines government and the revolution in Latin America (yet it's still fictional). I just wish that the characters weren't so twisted. I would recommend this novel to more mature readers (also, if you notice, older/more mature readers liked this book  you need maturity to read through the semi-explicit scenes). I'm guessing that the plot is the changes that occur in civilization through time and what those changes does to the people involved."
The Picture of Dorian Gray,0375751513,"Oscar Wilde, Jeffrey Eugenides",Barnes and Noble,4.1,MDC_ColumbiaU,"""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" is a fantastic book, mixing excellent wit with poignant commentary on society, intertwined around a spiritual story about a man who sold his soul unwittingly, but unrepentantly.  Make sure you read this book, BUT ... buy a different edition.

The editor of this book, Cauti, included many intelligent and spectacular notes throughout the book, but he includes asterisks and cross-marks throughout the book so that you will check his footnotes.  These appear on 90% of the pages, and they ruin the flow of Wilde's prose because the reader is compelled to stop reading, check the footnote, and return to their previous position.  The rhythm of the writing is totaly disrupted whenever this happens, and it is fair to say that this happens often.  Often enough, in fact, that I recommend you buy another edition.  Not this one."
The Picture of Dorian Gray,0375751513,"Oscar Wilde, Jeffrey Eugenides",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"Believe it or not, I had not heard of The Picture of Dorian Gray until the movie League of Extraordinaty Gentleman came out.  I know, crazy right.  No, I havn't lived under a rock my whole life.  I don't know how i missed it.  Well, after seeing the movie I rented every movie of The Picture of Dorian Gray I could find and fell in love with the story.  Then I read the book... and fell in love with the writing.

Reading the first chapter is like being swathed in wonderful writing from head too toe.  I felt completely surrounded by it.  You can almost feel the warmth of the garden,  hear the sounds of the birds and dragonflies, and smell the beauty of the flowers as you sit and listen to this conversation between Harry and Basil.  The writing is an immersive experince.  And Basil's description of his first encounter with Dorian and the feelings that Dorian stirs in him, sound almost... romantic.  At the least there's definately a bromance going on.  And we also see the first crack of Dorian's facade in this chapter, which Basil's decsription of how Dorian sometiems seems purposefully cruel to him.  Isn't it interesting, the first chapter ends with Harry demanding to meet Dorian and dragging Basil into the house and we haven't even met Dorian yet ourselves.  

As I read the book it occured to me that it could also have been titled the Influence of Lord Henry Wotten, for Harry's (as he's called by his friends) opinions and influence are as central to the story as Dorian Gray himself and more of a factor than the portrait itself. Hardly a scene goes by that Harry, whether present or not, is not quoted as an authority. It was as if he was the potter and Dorian was the clay.  Harry was fully aware of his influence, and Dorian... Dorian seemed to be racing from one sensation to another like a spoiled child.

This was by far one of the best written, most interesting stories I have read.  I will read it over and over and would recommend it to everyone.

The Picture of Dorian Gray,0375751513,"Oscar Wilde, Jeffrey Eugenides",Barnes and Noble,4.1,theokester,"I knew relatively little going into this book...and what little I did know was from less than 100% accurate retellings such as in League of Extraordinary Gentlemen or references from cheesy shows or horror flicks (I think perhaps there was a reference in Scooby Doo somewhere?). I had the basic gist...there's a guy, Dorian Gray, who has some magical painting that ages while he stays young and wonderful forever. Not much to go on, but I was still excited to read it. I was pleasantly surprised that the book had much more depth to it. 

I was a little torn on my overall feeling for the book. It took me a while to get into it and there were long passages that were drudgerous to push through. However, from a high level, this is one of the better books I've read this year...or even for numerous years. It had a plenitude of intriguing themes that left me thinking in between readings. It had a lot of humorous quips and paradigms as presented by Harry that I laughed out loud at. It had surprising twists and tension that left me curious as to the true outcome (as opposed to that from rip-off stories). There are a couple of spots that could be considered ""climax""...the confrontation with the artist is the main turning point in the book. Personally, I would have rather seen more pages after that turning point than before it. I think the last 1/3 of the book was far more engaging. At the same time, the buildup was necessary to promote the intended mood. 

Overall, this is a book I definitely recommend, with the caveat that you should be aware that it does slow down at points. Just push through those. The overall work is worthy of a couple of slow zones. In fact, perhaps those slow zones serve the purpose of allowing more pondering."

I've never read such a moving book ever.  In some ways I wished the story would continue but in some ways I'm glad the author wrote it the way that she did and ended it.  One thing is is that I wished that I knew what Christian was thinking throughout the story.  Since this is a first person book from Ana's perspective; that's all that we see.  

Hey E. L. please write the story again in Christian's point of view.  That would be awesome."

I blew off anything i could to get back to Christian and Ana. When it was all said and done --I missed so much what my husband and i had in the beginning. It reminded me that relationships are hard, but if i want to be happy... really happy... then it takes work. My husband used to call me 3 or 4 times a day (pre-tech) he used to dry my hair after we made love and took a shower. We used to never shower apart as a matter of fact... so many little things.

Sadly, however, it failed to appeal to me. Stoker badly needed an editor: there were distracting narrative inconsistencies all over the place. The characters seemed archetypal, but not in a good way. The women in the story were either highly sexualized or disturbingly victimized, an anti-New Woman novel if there ever was one. Overall, this book was a disappointment for me."

"The Girl Who Played with Fire (Millennium, #2)",0307269981,"Stieg Larsson, Reg Keeland",Barnes and Noble,4.3,bibliotek,"I was quite fortunate to have been provided with an advance reader's copy of ""The Girl Who Played with Fire.""  I had read, and loved, the first volume of this trilogy, ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.""  I am happy to report that I loved this second part of the story even more than the first.The book, like the first installement, is quite formidable in size, as it encompasses more than 500 pages.  Nonetheless, I tore through it in three nights.  I just could not put this book down; I had to reach the conclusion, searching for answers to so many puzzles posed during the narrative.  I found that the author again managed to write a most exciting, intriguing action story, while skillfully interweaving strong social commentary, particularly as against prostitution, the sex trade, and the horrid treatment of impoverished women with an utter lack of hope in their lives.The story reunites the reader with Lisbeth Salander, the fire-playing, tattoo-wearing young woman, who has to be one of the most unique fictional characters ever created.  Mikael Blomkvist, an honest, dedicated journalist also again commands our attention as the other  leading protagonist in the novel.  The book ends with quite a stunning turn of events (no spoiler here), which left me literally saying, ""WOW!""I most heartily recommend this book.  Again, the tragedy of the premature death of the author is truly felt."
"The Girl Who Played with Fire (Millennium, #2)",0307269981,"Stieg Larsson, Reg Keeland",Barnes and Noble,4.3,harstan,"Swedish Millennium magazine publisher and reporter Mikael Blomkvist is considering an expos&#233; of the extensive sex trafficking trade in Eastern Europe.  He knows the article will cause a stink in Sweden when the elite are exposed as participants.  However, just before the release of the damaging report, the lead journalists are murdered and the evidence including fingerprints on the weapon point to Lisbeth Salander.

With an outraged cry from the media and the government, some of whom headline the dead reporters' sex trafficking article, to hunt down this vicious killer, Salander knows she must put aside her beach reading of Fermat to uncover the real culprit.  Blomkvist knows the tattooed Salander is innocent and using his investigative skills as a crusader he also begins making inquiries.  

The second Blomkvist and Salander Swedish thriller is a super whodunit that brilliantly combines action-packed sequences with cerebral treatises.  The story line is fast-paced from the opening salvo and never slows down even when the heroine discusses mathematical theories as Blomkvist and Salander independently and united investigate the homicides with neither expecting the trail to take them to her past though their previous combined inquiry (see THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO) should have warned them.

I have been an avid reader my entire life, but I've never read any books that invoke such a powerful feeling of reality and emotion as this series does. I had an urgent desire to find out what was next for Ana and Christian, I could so easily see both of them as being real. It was so easy for me to put myself in Ana's place, to be her, to feel what she felt, and to think her thoughts. I know that I am completely enamored with a book and it's characters when I feel as if my 'real life' gets in the way of exploring the world an author has set up for me, and that has happened with this series to the point that I am considering making an appointment with Dr. Flynn to talk about it. *grin*  
These two people come together quite by accident, and despite their issues (or maybe because of their issues), find something MORE together...and truly, isn't that what we all are really searching for in life?"
"Fifty Shades Darker (Fifty Shades, #2)",1612130585,E.L. James,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"I read the first and second books of this series and had to stop there.  Honestly, I wanted to stop after the first, but I find it hard to start something and not finish.  The writing style is HORRIFIC.  6th grade level, if even that.  Once I learned it was written as Twilight fan fiction, it made more sense.  I couldn't imagine a serious author writing in this manner.  If I have to read about her &quot;inner goddess&quot; and how Christian smells, or how hot he is, ONE more time, I may fling this book across the room!  It's just 300+ pages (per book) of sex and redundant cliches.  I'm baffled by all these 5 star reviews!"

The Poisonwood Bible,0060786507,Barbara Kingsolver,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Hygd,"As a former missionary kid (Mish-Kid) this book brought back tons of memories.  I have seen real-life characters that would have fit so comfortably within the pages of this book.  The book, I believe, would be a fantastic read for many.  I definitely would not say for everyone.

Not too many people will read it on a nostalgic level as I did, and for some others who grew up similarly to me, it would bring back emotions and memories they would best forget.

It brought back memories to me of the missionary to Borneo who spoke at my school when I was a 13 year old kid.  He finished speaking and then invited all who would promise to someday go to Borneo as missionaries to stand, making public affirmation of this promise.  No one stood.  We were 13.  Who knew what tomorrow would bring?  The speaker, however, did not free us from the bonds of this assembly.  He kept repeating the ""invitation"".  After countless entreaties, we all stood up at once.  We'd had enough and were ready to get back to doing the things we wanted.  The speaker was thrilled.  Did he think that his message had reached us?  As far as I know, no one has gone on to missionary work in Borneo and I am now in my late 50's.

There was another fellow who sought to bring down the walls of Jericho.  Jericho being a local bar.  He and his church members marched around their Jericho, playing hymns with a trumpet and singing every night for some time...enough to bring down the walls of any modern day Jericho, if not at least to bring in the local authorities.  

I totally enjoyed Poisonwood.  I knew the people within its pages.  Great book."
The Poisonwood Bible,0060786507,Barbara Kingsolver,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"Before I read this book for a literature class, I had read some of Barbara Kingsolver's short stories. I really liked them, but I wasn't sure how a full-length book would be. And I have to say, the Poisonwood Bible is a fantastic novel. Kingsolver's writing flows and and is full of imagery and detail. It is set in the Congo, and follows the family of Nathan Price, a fanatical Baptist preacher. The story is told through the perspective of the four Price daughters and occasionally their mother. Kingsolver's ability to change her voice to match the personalities of her characters is incredible. My personal favorite Price is Adah, the damaged genius who plays with words and cynicism, but even the characters I disliked had interesting points to make. Definitely worth reading! :)"
The Poisonwood Bible,0060786507,Barbara Kingsolver,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,The Poisonwood Bible is a well written novel with an outstanding story line.  Barbara Kingsolver does a remarkable job of placing the reader in the middle of the jungle along with her characters and she includes enough history of the Congo to make the reader believe that this is almost a true story...even though it isn't! This book is definitely a great read for anyone looking for a great story!

The Count of Monte Cristo,0140449264,"Alexandre Dumas, Robin Buss",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"I have noticed that most of the reviews for this edition speak about Dumas' work in general, but I have to make a point that Robin Buss makes in the beginning of the book: almost every other version of The Count of Monte Cristo in English is either an abridgment or the product of Victorian editing.

This book has to be praised for the mere fact that Buss went back to the original French and translated it wonderfully, not abridging or altering the essential storyline. 

As of now, this is the only edition of such caliber that I know of, and for now, it is all I recommend that people buy.

Avoid all other editions and publishers, or at least make sure whether the one you want is an abridgment or not."

The Road,0307265439,Cormac McCarthy,Barnes and Noble,4,CinBake,"This was one of those literary works that I really didn't WANT to read but did beccause it was a Pulitzer winner - so often we get in a rut of reading just the genres that appeal to us most.  Boy, was I glad I ""branched out"" with this one.  I couldn't put it down and it stayed with me for days after I finished.  While it's not exactly entertaining, it was a MUST read for everyone who appreciates characters with depth and a plot that will make you look inward.  WONDERFUL book that I'm certain I'll read again in a few years and appreciate it just as much."
The Road,0307265439,Cormac McCarthy,Barnes and Noble,4,TeachLH,"Cormac McCarthy's The Road speaks to the hopeful part of all humans; the part that whispers to us that we are not alone, that even in the bleakest of times, there is possibility and promise.  
Some see this book as a warning of a fast approaching post-apocalyptic time when all life as we know it will be turned topsy turvy and basic human kindness will be swept away as pockets of people strive to survive.  And, I suppose, The Road could be described as such, but as the famed glass half empty or half full discussion, what you take from reading The Road surely will depend on what you bring to the reading.  The boy in this poignant story is a waning ray of faith whose optimism is juxtaposed against the realistic father who has been hardened by devastation and loss. This is a story of love, loss, and life but whether you are left comforted or frustrated depends on your own belief of mankind and life after life.  A litmus test of a book - you will find insight into your own beliefs."

It is even better on film. :)"
A Walk to Remember,0446693804,Nicholas Sparks,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"Funy how things work, I too have been diagnosed with a fatal disease. I am with the man I fell in love with when were 17, after a decade and a half years later. 
We always loved eachother but unfortunate events happened back then causing us to lose contact. We reunited after he found me on facebook and read my profile. He was shocked to learn of my illness, but he still wanted to be with me, even after all these years, even though I am sick and we won't grow old together. I love him very very much. 
I must admit, this story has given me the inspiration to marry my truest love! We plan on doing it, but private. That is where Jamie and me differ, I don't like crowds! Of course, I am not a Saint like her character is either, though people cannot understand why I am so cheerful, optimistic, and happy. I say it is because you have to believe in hope and never let yourself get down or you will just get sicker that much faster.
Nicholas Sparks hits the nail right on the head with this incredible story!

A Walk to Remember,0446693804,Nicholas Sparks,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"¿In every way, a walk to remember.¿ In A Walk to Remember, by Nicholas Sparks, seventeen year-old Landon Carter is a senior at Beaufort high school. Every year, the high school and the local Baptist church puts on the play The Christmas Angel written by the minister of the church. The play features seniors. Landon gets casts as the male lead role, while his opposite is Jamie Sullivan, the minister¿s daughter. Jamie is not accepted by her classmates. She carries around a bible and is extremely religious. Jamie and Landon start spending most of their time together. They even go to the homecoming dance together. Landon learns of Jamie¿s dream and all Landon wants to do is to fulfill it. This realistic fiction novel was amazingly well written which is expected from Nicholas Sparks. The book pulls you in right away. The way Sparks writes this novel as a memory is a great way of telling a story. The way he describes Beaufort, North Carolina, it feels like you have been there a thousand times.This was a fun book that I really enjoyed. A Walk to Remember was a fast read that I didn¿t put down. A great book for ages 12 and up. This story is about Landon and Jamie who accidently fall in love. Landon is a bad boy and Jamie is a goody two shoes that goes to church. Landon pulls a prank on a kid and gets him put in the hospital and Landon has to do community service hours, so he gets assigned to a play at the school that Jamie helps him with. At first he just wants it to be over, but like every good story there¿s a twist. Jamie has a secret, will she tell him? This book is one of the best books I have ever read, no joke, I would defiantly suggest this book, I didn't put it down once. Will Jamie tell Landon her secret? Will they get married? Will they go their separate ways? Read this astonishing book, A Walk to Remember. A defiant book that I would want my children to read, very good heart warming, tear jerking, story."

"Confessions of a Shopaholic (Shopaholic, #1)",0440241413,Sophie Kinsella,Barnes and Noble,4.1,XXXOOOBookwormOOOXXX,"onfessions of A Shopaholic is a cute and witty story about something more of us would probably care to admit to. The allure of tempting eye-candy all around us in whatever your particular weakness is (in Rebecca's case FASHION) and the ease of charging it to a credit card. It's panic time when the bills come in and Rebecca knows how to creatively dodge the bill collectors. Throw in a little romantic comedy and you are hooked on Rebecca's story. I really enjoyed it and want to read Sophia Kinsella's other books. I really enjoyed this book, it was hard to believe someone could be so addicted to shopping, it was entertaining. he interplay of characters is what makes the book enjoyable, from Becky's roommate, to Luke, to the bank manager, to Becky's parents. They are real people and that makes the story enjoyable to me. The writing is also clever and overrides the obnoxiousness that Becky occasionally engenders. The first book in the series is a good start and makes a good foundation, leaving room for growth. If you're looking for a light read, give it a try!"

"A Clash of Kings  (A Song of Ice and Fire, #2)",0553381695,George R.R. Martin,Barnes and Noble,4.6,JGolomb,"Many editorial reviews of book (or movie) sequels claim that the second is as good as, or better than, the original. I read the same thing about ""A Clash of Kings"", George R.R. Martin's sequel to ""A Game of Thrones"". I was a bit skeptical, I mean...how can one not question whether Martin could duplicate what he accomplished in the first novel, let alone better it. ""Thrones"" is magnificently expansive and epic...how could book 2 match the energy and intensity?

Martin absolutely knocked the ball out of the park with ""Clash"". I don't know if it's better than ""Thrones"", but it's easily its equal. He takes the core set of surviving characters (Arya, Sansa, Bran, Catelyn, Jon, Cersei and the wonderfully rich Tyrion), and picks up almost immediately where ""Thrones"" left off. And I don't just mean in terms of plot, but also in building out his fantastic world of intrigue, adventure and politics. 

""Clash"" is complicated, intense and absolutely epic. It sprawls majestically over a widely varied physical and literary landscape. The politics within the plot, focused on four Kings battling over a land that's used to having only one, are intricate, but not difficult to follow. Martin's writing is clear, his dialogue is smooth and the interplay between characters is enjoyable and completely in sync with the overall tone and 'place' of the story. The book is very serious and heavy - at about 1,000 pages, the book is actually heavy, but I love the weightiness, with corresponding depth, of the story.

Like ""Thrones"", there's not a ton of fantasy in ""Clash"". It's very middle-ages-historical-fiction with a tinge of supernatural. There's more fantasy in this book than in the first, though, and it feels like it'll build into much more for the third book. There are dragons, but they set up a certain tone and act more as a plot device than anything else. There's no fire-breathing and attacking and destroying. There's further development around Bran's supernatural connection with his direwolf Summer, and we see that the bastard Stark, Jon, has a bit of the gift as well. There are a few more fantastical devices scattered throughout the book, which Martin develops slowly through his world's mythology rather than hammering in a slew of de facto dungeons & dragons.

The characters are Martin's true accomplishment. He feeds off a character's strengths and deficiencies, and each one is perfectly human and in some way relate-able. Individuals-as-'outsiders', is the base upon which the best characters are built. And he uses that foundation frequently. Tyrion, the dwarf prince, has become one of my favorite and most memorable characters in the series, and perhaps one of the most well-developed characters in any popular fiction. He's witty and smart, and sometimes obnoxiously flip. But his deep-seated insecurities which evolve slowly over the course of both of the first books make his chapters the most anticipated. Arya develops into a wonderfully three dimensional character as the tomboy princess cut off from her family, trying to survive and find a way back home. Sansa's princess-ly arrogance dissipates under the strain of trying to survive as a hostage, and finds friends in very un-princess-ly places. 

I'm looking forward to seeing HBO's creation of Martin's world of Ice and Fire coming this spring. Until then, I'll start digging into book 3 - ""A Storm of S"
"A Clash of Kings  (A Song of Ice and Fire, #2)",0553381695,George R.R. Martin,Barnes and Noble,4.6,GloveSlipper,"Let me first state that I love this series. These books are wonderful for escaping on a snowy night. The characters, good or bad, continue to forge a place in your heart. The books have everything you would want from a work of fiction, except.

This series is sad. Without any specific spoilers I can say that there is not one thing that has happened in this series that makes you feel good. Even when a character falls in love there is an underlying issue that makes the love a bad idea. The characters you care about are put through one horrific event after another and most of the characters are children. I know the series is far from finished but at this point, every single chapter you can rest assured that the characters you love will have nothing good happen to them. 

Read this series but take a break in between books. There is no rush as the author has very little interest in finishing the series quickly. Otherwise, the chapters begin to feel like a depressing grind."

The Memory Keeper's Daughter,0143037145,Kim Edwards,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Guest,I've read a lot of people being disappointed in this book and then some who loved it. It all depends on what your looking for. The book was not what I was looking for but it was still a good book.   I read to escape every day life and disappointments and this book puts you in real life. It was very sad and depressing to see how lies and regrets will affect your future. I was crying by the time the book was done.   Don't get me wrong its a good story but very sad and depressing.
The Memory Keeper's Daughter,0143037145,Kim Edwards,Barnes and Noble,3.5,1Katherine1,"The Memory Keeper's Daughter is a book that should be savored. Each paragraph is awash in beautiful imagery and the phrasing is glorious. I found myself rereading paragraphs to fully appreciate the imagery.
The story is heart-wrenching. I have found myself with a new insight into people suffering from Down's Syndrome. I will never look at them in the same way again.
The characters are real, and the reader can feel the anguish, joy, heartache and struggles that can be the result of one decision made on one night. At any moment, we can experience a moment that can change our lives forever.
A must read!"
The Memory Keeper's Daughter,0143037145,Kim Edwards,Barnes and Noble,3.5,vlf1493,"The ink spilling out of an author's pen, spreading on a blank piece of paper, fresh, spontaneous, like the accidental pattern footprints make on the clean slate that is a sandy shore. Each individual pairs up words with their own finesse, secretly wishing a successful outcome.  American author Kim Edwards excels in her first novel ""The memory keeper's daughter"" in more ways than one. With the intriguing plot, mesmerizing descriptiveness and as a whole the heartwarming message the story leaves behind.
	David Henry, a work-driven doctor has the miraculous ability and luck to deliver his own twins from the love of his life, Norah. When the second baby, a girl, is delivered, due to his lucid knowledge on medicine, he instantly realizes the peculiar features which make her fit into the category of a baby with down syndrome. With the intention of sparing her wife the pain, he gives it to the nurse Caroline and tells her to take her to an institute for mentally challenged children, planning to tell Norah the baby girl was a still birth. When Caroline arrives to the institute, she makes the decision of keeping the baby, Phoebe, due to the pitiful conditions of the institute. This turn Caroline takes leads to every possible problem that could have ever been thought of.
	From the very first page of this best selling novel, I was captured by the story, feeling and anticipating what each character was going through. With the plot revolving around such a delicate subject, children with Down syndrome, the powerful, emotional blizzard the author strikes us with is inevitable. Another key element that propels this book is the change in character perspective the author lets us perceive. With the conflict having two completely different angles, through perspective alternation we get to live beside different characters struggling with different aspects of one same problem. This novel also helps us as the readers, get the flexibility of supporting whichever side of the conflict we best relate with, not only with what the usual one-voice narrator or speaker is expressing.
	I also praise Kim Edwards greatly for her incredible vocabulary. The way she uses words to drown the reader in her story is impressive and not very common in novels. While reading the back of my book before actually starting to read it, I noticed how all the reviews from the most acknowledged sources esteemed Edward's way of describing to the finest detail each aspect, character, setting and situation of her story. She proved them right, and satisfied my expectations.
	Last but not least I can't ignore the deep message this novel conveys. From beginning to end the story circles around this one innocent little girl, tagged by society as a mongoloid, or a child suffering from Down syndrome. With David, the main character and her father, giving her away, various conflicts appear as a domino effect, deceit, affairs, redemption, secrets and more. The resolution to all this conflict leads to the simple lesson of love before interest.
	In conclusion, I recommend this phenomenal piece of work to all in search of a thrilling novel full of emotion, description and intriguing moments. Kim Edwards' way of writing is hypnotic. I assure anyone who succumbs to reading it will not be disappointed."
"Me Before You (Me Before You, #1)",0670026603,Jojo Moyes,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Dollycas,"Louisa Clark (Lou) is just an ordinary woman leading her life, living with and helping to take care of her parents and grandfather. Then the job she loves at the cafe is gone. The owner has closing and moved away. Jobs are hard to come by and she tries a few. Then she is convinced to become a companion/caregiver to Will Traynor. A man who was a daredevil and astute businessman that has been sidelined by an accident the caused damage to his spinal cord. He is now in a wheelchair and can only move one hand slightly. Will is acerbic, moody, bossy&mdash;but Lou refuses to treat him with kid gloves, and soon his happiness means more to her than she expected. When she learns that Will has shocking plans of his own, she sets out to show him that life is still worth living.
 



I couldn't wait to dive into this book. I had only read a small synopsis sent by the publicist before I started reading. I knew the man in the story was paralyzed but didn't really give it more than a passing thought until I read about his injury. His damage to his spine was in the C5-6 area, the exact same place as my injury. He is confined to a wheelchair with very little movement. This could have been me. I was lucky to have paralysis only claim one side of my body. This did give me pause but I continued reading. Will Traynor went through the same feelings and doubt and uncertainty that I did and still sometimes have. But he did do something I could never do. He decided to have 6 months with his family and then he would end his life at a assisted suicide clinic in  Switzerland. Lou will do anything to get him to change his mind. To say this book affected me deeply in an understatement.

Jojo Moyes has written a brilliant story that was well researched. She incorporates spinal injury online support groups to help Lou understand what Will is going through. From experience I know the snippets in the book are credible. She has included a caregiver that takes care of the more personal and medical needs for Will so that Lou is more of a friend or companion at least at first.

She has also created a wonderful cast of supporting characters. Lou&rsquo;s lower class family, working hard every day to try to keep up. Her sister, the family favorite, with her own personal battles. Lou&rsquo;s boyfriend who has suddenly become a fitness guru. Then there is Will&rsquo;s family. Upper middle class with a huge house and plenty of money. But even with their son&rsquo;s disability aside, were they ever happy? I truly enjoyed the chapters when other characters took over and gave their perspective. We were able to get a deeper vision of their thoughts and impressions of  their lives as well as their feelings about Lou and Will.

This was not a book that I could rush through but I feel that is because of my personal issues with the story. I found myself setting the book aside because some parts were so powerful or when I found myself actually crying so much the words were blurred. It is not your run of the mill love story. Feelings grew in ways that I didn't even imagine. I don&rsquo;t want to ruin the end for anyone but I was truly hoping for a different outcome. I understood, but as a person who has actually looked death in the eye and came back, life is just too precious to me.

An intense story, I highly recommend you have a box of tissues handy."

Catch-22,0684833395,Joseph Heller,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"I'm not going to talk about the content of the book. People have covered that.

The NookBook of Catch-22 was generated from a scanned manuscript and then insufficiently copyedited. To pick one example, words that begin with ""Li"" are frequently rendered with a ""U"" instead; so, say, ""Lip"" becomes ""Up."" It happened often enough to be distracting.

Considering we're asked to pay MORE than the paperback price for the NookBook, and we can't return the NookBook for being shoddy, this is unacceptable."
Catch-22,0684833395,Joseph Heller,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"When I think of the term ""war story,"" I tend to think of the long grueling battles, the wounded dying in the mud, or the sounds of guns blasting in the distance. However, in Joseph Heller's great novel, Catch-22, the most significant and my favorite scenes are ones not on the battlefield; they are the ones at camp. The ingenious (yet sometimes confusing) plot is centered around the main character in this novel, Yossarian, who has seen the inhumane and thoughtless actions of his superiors during the second half of WWII. He is an air force pilot stationed in the Mediterranean Sea conducting bombing raids that seem to never end. After enduring one mission after another, he stumbles on a way to be discharged from service if he is deemed insane. His never-ending search to get out of the military and his conversations with his friend Nately are humorous and entertaining. However, when Yossarian first claims to be ""insane,"" he proves to the doctors that he truly IS sane because anyone who is really sane would want to be discharged. This confusing paradox, or circular reasoning, is Catch-22. Catch-22 is described in many other ways, mostly in other nearly incomprehensible paradoxes that ""catches"" its subject in its illogic, and always allows the government complete control over the pilots' lives. The theme of total power to the government can also be found in some other side stories (and flashbacks that happen at unspecified times) throughout the novel, such as when Officer Minderbinder can make himself immense amounts of cash just by trading amongst the companies he himself owns. You find yourself rooting for the soldiers, and wonder why they must die.  I thought Yossarian's struggles with the law Catch-22 as amusing as no matter where you went, or which way, the government always ended up on top. And as the war goes on, Yossarian witnesses more tragedies among his men- murder, death, rape, and disease. When he is arrested in the streets of Rome, he is given a choice; Stay in the Air Force, or be honorably discharged. But there's a cache, if he is discharged, his men in his squadron must fly another eighty missions. Will Yossarian be tempted to regain a life of his own, and yet endanger the lives of his own men? Or will he continue to fly under the rule of Catch-22? Although the plot is hard to comprehend at first, is you persevere through the confusing flashbacks and characters whose names you forget, it will all make sense in the end."
Catch-22,0684833395,Joseph Heller,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Way_of_the_Carl,"Catch 22 is a classic novel that comes around every ten years or so that delivers a story so out of the ordinary and yet so real that everyone who loves to read should pick this title up.  Not only did this book create a phrase that has lasted the ages it makes you think what could have been if...Even though thinking this way will only get you in trouble because of the Catch 22 you find yourself in.  Joseph Heller brings to the table a dainty group of soldiers who believe someone is trying to kill them and that they are going to die, even though they don't want to.  The dialog back and forth is outrageous and hilarious, making one wonder how would I react if I was stuck in the same situation.I found this classic easy to read and understand, rooting for the soldiers to come back home asking myself ""Why do they have to die?"", even if they don't.  You'll love Heller's creation of a wayside group of individuals vying to survive in a outfit of misfits who can't seem to get along.  He delivers solid dialog and great storytelling, running the reader through the muck of unmotivated soldiers all trying their hardest to survive."
Middlesex,0312422156,Jeffrey Eugenides,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"Very interesting read. On the surface, a story about a Greek-American hermaphrodite. Calliope/Cal narrates this tale of birth and rebirth.Cal describes the family history and traces the journey of a rare, recessive gene over about 80 years. Cal's grandparents flee from their burning home in a small village in Turkey. Desdemona and Lefty, brother and sister, reinvent themselves during their journey to America and get married. When their son marries his cousin, two recessive genes collide. The result? Calliope, raised as a girl until an emergency room doctor notices something different about her. A visit to a famous specialist in New York sets Calliope on a completely new path and she is reborn as Cal.Excellent character development and the intricate details of Cal's convoluted family history will keep readers turning pages. The normal adolescent angst and sexual exploration take on a whole new dimension, yet these issues are handled with grace, sensitivity, and, often, humor.I did not expect to like this book, as it was on my ""have to read"" list, rather than the ""want to read"" list. Nevertheless, Cal's story grabbed me from the very first lines. I found this to be an excellent read."
Middlesex,0312422156,Jeffrey Eugenides,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Lisa_RR_H,"I loved this novel. I picked up this fat tome with some trepidation, hearing it was inspired by a memoir discovered and promoted by Foucault by and about a hermaphrodite. I pictured some post-modern turgid avant-garde mess--like Delillo's Underworld, which had been on the same recommendation list. Instead I found what was promised in Underworld's blurbs was fulfilled in Middlesex--a Great American Novel--and a page-turner.

Strangely, in the tale of a hermaphrodite I didn't find anything remotely freakish, but humanely universal, as if by having this protagonist of an ambiguous gender, Eugenides was able to embrace and bridge both (all?) genders. It's an ambitious work, taking in about 80 years from his Greek immigrant grandparents roots in Turkey, to his parents and childhood in Detroit, to his coming of age on the road from New York City to San Francisco and his current life at a diplomatic posting in Germany. It takes in massacres in Turkey, Ellis Island, the development of America's car culture, Prohibition with it's Speakeasies and bootlegging, The Great Depression, World War II, The Nation of Islam, Detroit race riots and Black/White relations, the sexual revolution, politics, religion--there doesn't seem anything missed, and yet nothing that feels rambling or contrived or caricatured.

The voice is miraculous. Technically it's a first person narrative, but it breaks the bonds of that point of view into an expansive omniscience in telling its story of three generations: Book One dealing with his grandparents in Turkey and their immigration to Detroit; Book Two with the story of his grandparents and parents in Detroit before his birth; Book Three with his childhood and early adolescence; Book Four with his crisis of identity when doctors discover he's not the girl he was raised to be. Even in those two parts of the book during his own lifetime, the narration has that expansive, feel of third person omniscience, but with the intimacy of the first person voice.

Eugenides makes me feel for his characters. I ached for Callie--and Cal--both. I worried for him. I hoped for him. I was propelled through the 500 pages not wanting to skip one paragraph and ended it sorry it was over and wanting to read this again sometime--and Eugenides other novel."
Middlesex,0312422156,Jeffrey Eugenides,Barnes and Noble,4.2,mL_i_B,"&ldquo;I was born twice: first, as a baby girl, on a remarkably smogless Detroit day in January 1960; and then again, as a teenage boy, in an emergency room near Petoskey, Michigan, in August of 1974.&rdquo; Jeffrey Eugenides draws the reader into Middlesex in just the first sentence, and sets the scene for the purpose of the novel. Immediately, the reader is aware that the main character, later named Cal/Calliope, is a hermaphrodite. This is interesting because, BAM, within the book&rsquo;s first few words the most shocking information about the story is already revealed. Eugenides could have decided to keep this information quiet and completely shock the reader in the middle of the novel when an emergency room technician discovers Cal&rsquo;s embarrassing truth. However, due to other elements in the story, this strategy would not have been nearly as satisfying. Middlesex is a story of controversy, a story of history, a story of secrets, a story of coming of age. All of which are tied together beautifully. 
	The novel takes a historical, twisting path from Greece in the 1920&rsquo;s to 1960&rsquo;s Detroit and 1970&rsquo;s San Francisco. The story begins by telling Cal&rsquo;s Grandparents&rsquo; history. This occupies a good part of the novel; and I feel if the reader was unaware of Cal&rsquo;s abnormalities they would be questioning why she was going into such detail with their life story. This is why revealing Cal&rsquo;s predicament in the first sentence works so well. It is ALWAYS in the back of the reader&rsquo;s mind. The reader is compelled to find out more about Cal&rsquo;s sexuality, and why she is like the way she is. Watching her deal with her unique problems makes the novel a one of a kind, modern coming of age tale. 
	Cal also periodically interjects parts of her current life into the novel, which takes place in modern day Europe. Again, the fact that the reader knows of Cal&rsquo;s troubles makes these parts understandable. However, these sections of the book did not click with me. At one point in the story Cal travels cross country (don&rsquo;t worry, this does not give away much) and during this journey, I began to question her survival. But, because of the constant interjection of her current life, I knew that death was not an option. My imagination could not run wild. These pieces also called for a complete change of gears, which i was not fond of. One moment I was on a boat somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean in the 1920&rsquo;s, and the next I was on a subway during the twentieth century. It would have added another element of surprise to the story if Cal&rsquo;s current life was talked about at the end. 
	Nevertheless, the story contains many layers. This is satisfying because just as the story has different elements, so does the idea of hermaphroditism. Eugenides constantly adds in historical events, such as the fire in Smyrna, Turkey. He also adds even greek culture by paralleling Cal&rsquo;s story with that of Greek myths. He tells a classic story of immigrants coming to America, while also revealing a modern story about a hermaphrodite. This contrast is written so beautifully. Which is why the story of an uncomfortable topic actually works well. The novel is not just about a Hermaphrodite. Middlesex is about history, about Greek culture, about family secrets, about adventures, about acceptance."
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,0143039563,"Mark Twain, Guy Cardwell, John Seelye",Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"This book is about two boys named Tom and Huck.  They heard about a treasure buried somewhere.   They are trying to find out where the treasure is buried but they have a little problem--other people are looking for the treasure too. Injun Joe is also looking for the treasure and he is the meanest person that no one likes.  One night Tom and Huck were walking in a grave yard and saw Injun Joe kill a guy. So now Tom and Huck are scared of Injun Joe.  Then Tom ran away to an island because he wanted to try living on his own.  Everyone in the town thought Tom and Huck died, but they didn¿t.  On the day of their funeral they showed up and surprised all the grown ups.  Do they find the treasure?  Read and find out. This was an easy book to read because it was short.  I liked this book because it had a lot of adventure."
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,0143039563,"Mark Twain, Guy Cardwell, John Seelye",Barnes and Noble,4,Mark Strack,"I read this book to my 6 year old daughter and she loved it. Keep in mind it's been rewritten and shortened up for a younger audience, but it was a great way to get her interested in the classics. We've read many from the series and have not once been disappointed."
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,0143039563,"Mark Twain, Guy Cardwell, John Seelye",Barnes and Noble,4,Trevor_,"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain is a very enthralling novel. It is about an imaginative young boy, Tom Sawyer who can be very mischievous but is naturally ""good"", instead of his half brother Sid, or the novel's antagonist, Injun Joe. He begins the story as a manipulative young rebel, which is demonstrated when he swindles his classmates into whitewashing a fence that he was originally punished to do, in exchange for small treasures. Tom, captivated with stories of pirates and other rebels, leads him and his friends in a series of adventures, from playing battles to running away to an island to create a pirate crew. As the adventures become more serious and dangerous, Tom becomes more and more mature. After witnessing a murder, and testifying against the killer, Injun Joe, Tom and Huckleberry Finn fear for their lives while treasure hunting, and they both display heroics that ultimately result into their ""real"" maturation into adulthood. Twain, throughout the story satirizes the hypocrisy of most adult institutions, such as the church, Sunday school, regular school and the temperance tavern. He views that adults are hypocritical and pretentious, possessing a certain ""false maturity"". This ""false"" maturity is defined by the moral maturity a person or institution has. For example, the temperance tavern, which is not supposed to serve alcohol, has a secret back room that does just that. By the end of the novel, Tom changed from attempting to undermine all authority, into a defender of the respectable adult society, displaying the truest sense of moral maturity, even though he was still not very old. Tom first explores superstitions with Huck, and soon becomes dependant on them. They created so many beliefs that in any uncertain situation, such as when they were in the haunted mansion, they can provide reassurance and confidence in one's self. Rebellion is prevalent within the novel. Tom and his friends commit crimes and disobey their parents, but they never are geared at hurting any other people. These minor rebellions could never lead to worse crimes, because Tom and the boys felt deep remorse only for stealing small amounts of bacon. These rebellious adventures for Tom lead to his praise within the community, like when he returns from Jackson's Island and shows up at his own funeral, only to be greeted with hugs. Injun Joe however, commits crimes that are obviously harmful to others such as murder, and finally dies, which shows that Twain condemns crimes that are harmful to others. I strongly recommend this intriguing book, although at times it can be hard to follow."
"A Wrinkle in Time (A Wrinkle in Time Quintet, #1)",0440498058,Madeleine L'Engle,Barnes and Noble,4.3,esuh,this book is soo good. its such a heartwarming story and i just LOVE the ending. i can read this book over and over again for sure
"A Wrinkle in Time (A Wrinkle in Time Quintet, #1)",0440498058,Madeleine L'Engle,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,I purchased this book for my granddaughter to read.  She and I took turns reading the book to one another.  We found it most delightful.  We were able to vocalize the various parts and it was great fun.  Great reading for all ages.
"A Wrinkle in Time (A Wrinkle in Time Quintet, #1)",0440498058,Madeleine L'Engle,Barnes and Noble,4.3,SuperGrrl,"This classic tale of Meg and her brother Charles Wallace has been in my subconscious ever since I read it when I was a child.  The themes of good versus evil, the hero being a young misfit girl who I could readily identify with, all gave me hope that I would one day be someone who could make a difference (although I didn't see how).  This book is more than just a book - it is a message that ""everything is going to be all right"" without sugarcoating the evil that lurks outside and without hiding the fact that you, the next generation, is what has to fight it.  A MUST READ for every YA reader.  If it wasn't on my Nook, I'd sleep with it under my pillow."
The Joy Luck Club,0143038095,Amy Tan,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"The Joy Luck Club is a story that portrays the different vignettes of four tenacious Chinese immigrant mothers and their first generation strong American daughters. As a first generation Chinese myself, I could immediately relate to some of the difficulties that the daughters faced, and many of the vignettes of the mothers reminded me of my parents/grandparents stories. The story also gives the reader a glimpse into the life of a typical Chinese lady in the 20th century and introduces the reader to Chinese culture and society.

           In the book, the daughters often try to be free from the constant nagging of the mother's, and one of the daughters even views her mother as an obstacle she must overcome, her own personal battle. I could really relate to the hard time that the daughters faced, because I myself am used to having my grandpa always comment on everything I do. His complaining would often leave me feeling imprisoned and constrained. I just wanted to get away from everything and anything that had to do with my family. However, through the course of this book I came to realize that the nitpicking of the older generation was just their own unique way of showing their love for their children.

            Many times, the Chinese daughters are often left confused by their mother's messages. The daughters cannot relate and understand the underlying meaning because of the different cultures that the mothers and daughters come from. While the Chinese culture is a high context culture the American culture is the polar opposite, a low context culture. Often times, the clashing of cultures would lead to confusion and frustration on both sides. I think that another reason why the mothers and daughters have such a difficult time understanding each other is because of the completely different environments that they grew up in. The mother's faced sexism, racism, and the struggle to just simply survive. Often times, the things that they learned growing up became important symbols and lessons that they hoped to pass down to their children.  But to the daughters who grew up  in an environment where they tried to hide their roots as much as possible, and being Asian was ""unfashionable"", these messages only helped to widen the gap between mother and daughter. The book illustrates the journey that the mothers and daughters faced trying to understand the different cultures and perspectives of the Chinese and American way of thinking.

            Chinese people prize filial piety above all other characteristics, and I remember often having to go to temples to pay my respects to my ancestors and that I could not talk back to my elders. In one of the stories, the Joy Luck Club is having a crab dinner. Since everyone immediately grabbed the largest and juiciest crabs, the hosts, Suyuan (mother), and Jing-mei (daughter), are left with the last two crabs. Jing-mei knows that one of the crabs was dead before they bought it, which is bad luck in Chinese culture, so she willingly grabs the dead crab so that her mother may enjoy the tastier crab. This is a very good example of filial piety, while everyone else is greedy, and hopes for the best for themselves, the daughter is being respectful by leaving the better crab for her mother. I specifically remembered this story from the book because I think that if I was in the same position as Jing-mei I would have taken the better crab for myself."
The Joy Luck Club,0143038095,Amy Tan,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"This book was one of the most enlighting, purest books ever!  I loved it from the beginning it shows you the powerful bond between mothers and daughters 'cheesy I know but true!'.  It shows hardship, passion, and experience.  It showed me what mothers are capable of and what they would do to protect their children, and it inspired me to be in English Honors as well as a possible future writer..."
The Joy Luck Club,0143038095,Amy Tan,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"Wow is what I have to say about this book if I had to describe it in one word. I'm a senior in high school and my english teacher gave it to me because we are going to read it later in the year but I read it early. I started on the first page and couldn't stop. I have never read a lot like this, I read all 336 pages in two days, in school, after school, whenever I had the chance. I LOVE the way Amy Tan wrote this book, the vignettes are so beautiful and touching. I found myself really feeling for the characters in the book. I am mesmorized, I feel the most unexplainable feeling of happiness and sadness since I have read it. I can't wait to read it again!"
The Handmaid's Tale,038549081X,Margaret Atwood,Barnes and Noble,4,constantreaderML,"Everyone should read this book. Period. Take it as a warning, of what CAN happen in the U.S., if religious extremism is allowed to infiltrate our society, and if Church and State don't stay separate. And keep in mind that Atwood took the social/political circumstances in the book from real situations that have happened or are happening somewhere in the world. The writing pulls the reader in, and even though the subject is terribly depressing, you just can't quit reading it. Now that I've finished it, I can't quit thinking about it. I want to read about it, and talk about it, and read more by the author. But I won't read it again for a long time, because it's plausibility is just too disturbing. Any author who can instill such strong emotions in her/his readers is a very talented writer."
The Handmaid's Tale,038549081X,Margaret Atwood,Barnes and Noble,4,andrewlin,"To categorize The Handmaid's Tale as another feminist piece of literature would be inaccurate, as it is really more. Like other novels that present visions of the world in the future, The Handmaid's tale imagines a dystopia that is all at once surreal and convincing, just as Orwell's 1984 or Huxley's Brave New World are. Though Offred's condition may appear unrealistic or even absurd at a glance, as the novel unfolds, Atwood reveals social circumstances shockingly real and in fact similar to our own."
The Handmaid's Tale,038549081X,Margaret Atwood,Barnes and Noble,4,FARIEQUEENE,"I picked up this book over a decade ago on a break in between classes while I was at school and bored.  I remember vividly reading the entire book in a day and re-reading the book so often that when I purchased my nook last December, ""The Handmaid's Tale"" was the first book I bought.  Atwood's glance at a sexist and distopian society is terrifying and the book makes a strong statement about what happens when the state has too much control.
The Red Dresses and Blue Dresses haunt me til this day, and yet I read the book over and over again when I cannot find anything else to tempt me."
"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (Sisterhood, #1)",0385729332,Ann Brashares,Barnes and Noble,4.6,AnimeFreak1,"Im 15 going on 16 and I absolutely LOVED this book. It was worth every penny!

In the story I felt that the pants truely were magical! Having bought this book at a secondhand thrift store for a $1.50 added even more magic :) Im a very picky reader but I was hooked from page one. I though it was going to be a sloppy, corny story, but I was wrong!! My cousin wouldn't shut up about it and told me that I just HAD to read it. I finished the book in about a day or two and I completely cried my eyes out in the end. Can't wait to read the other ones!! and maybe watch the movie too :) 
I loved the way the story was laid out. IT FORCES YOU TO KEEP READING!! One minute you're reading about Lena and then, it shifts over to Carmen, and then Tibby, and then Bridget, and back to Lena and so on... Oh! And in every chapter theres a cute little quote :) I loved it, some of them were funny too! I took this book to school with me and started reading in the cafeteria, and my friends looked at me like I was crazy cause I started crying. Why was I crying? 2 reasons: #1 I had finished reading it. #2 read the book and you'll see :) This book is absolutely PERFECT FOR THE SUMMER since it takes place during that time. I love books that just make me all emotional inside. Most people rate books with stars. I rate mine with tears. I cried soooo much in the end. 
There's always one character that you can relate to the most, but in this book you can relate to all of them in some ways :) I love Lena, we have the same taste and artistic skill and tend to be a little introverted. I loved Carmen too. We're both part Puerto Rican with some junk in the trunk and a broken family. Bridget and I share the same passion for soccer and Tibby and I have that little snappy attitude at times, we're not afraid to speak our mind, and we have crappy jobs with annoying bosses -_- In short :) quit wasting time reading stupid reviews about other peoples opinions about this book. Go out and buy it and read it. You won't regret it at all"

"Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West (The Wicked Years, #1)",0060987103,"Gregory Maguire, Douglas Smith",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Codefox,"I saw the Broadway show in February and it was absolutely incredible.  Clearly I needed to read the book that this masterpiece was drawn from.  A play can only tell a small part of a story so the book had to be amazing.  Amazing is a word I would use to describe the book, certainly:

Amazingly boring.  Amazingly bad.  Amazingly pretentious.

I couldn't tell you what the plot was for this book.  Every time it seems like the author is going to give us a real plot, he whisks you away to some point in the future.  Be prepared to be left hanging.  A lot.

I was constantly waiting to find out more about things that happened in the book.  What was the group that Elphie was part of?  What did Madam Morrible really do to Glinda, Elphie, and Nessa?

Things just happen because we're told they happen.  Glinda and Elphie are friends, why?  Not relevant.  You just have to accept that they are.

The gratuitous sex scenes all seemed out of place as well.  Why did the author choose to write them?  Was it to shock the reader?  They added nothing to the story.  I suppose since I would argue there was no real story, that it would be impossible to add to it.  The author also had an obsession with urination.  I guess the denizens of Oz have bladder control issues.

This disjointed, plotless, lifeless excuse for a novel was all buried under flowery language.  I'm an avid reader and I have no trouble with big words.  But as boring as Wicked was, the writing style just made it even more painful to get through.

It was a painful trip from beginning to end.  Go see the musical.  They took the idea of what this story wanted to be and made it something exciting and fun.  There's a payoff at the end of the musical.  There's none at the end of Wicked, other than the fact you don't have to read it any longer."
"Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West (The Wicked Years, #1)",0060987103,"Gregory Maguire, Douglas Smith",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Moonbunnyperry,"As an avid fan of Wizard of Oz I was always told that ""Wicked"" would be a great follow up and new take on Oz. I became a fan of the musical adaptation of the book but was told they are greatly different. This fueled me wanting to read the book. It wasn't till recently that I finally did. The book is very well done.  The book took the tale classic tale, showing before and how Elphie became the ""wicked witch"". Elphie's tale makes you wonder was she really wicked and evil or just a girl who's life took turns giving people other ideas about her?
I can't wait to read the follow up books to the ""Wicked"" series but i bet they will be just as great as this one.

All and all wicked is just a great read and should defiantly be added to your collection."

This was a fantastic story! It is imaginative, creative, unique and beautifully written. This is narrated and seen through the eyes of a five year old boy, Jack. Imagine seeing the world from the perspective of a child, experiencing life for the first time, his innocent thoughts that adults could actually learn something from. Jack's mother had been kidnapped and placed inside a stifling small space, a bathroom, some basic cooking equipment, and a TV. Over a period of years, she gives birth to Jack, and he too is kept locked inside, so his view of ""the world"" is so limited, not even to have seen daylight. What imagination it had to have taken to create this realistic view of such horror and innocence. This is an experience to behold and nightmares maybe experienced long after."

Room,0316098337,Emma Donoghue,Barnes and Noble,4,Ree_Anderson,"Wow.  Really, just wow.  This book is, by far, my favorite read of 2010.  I admit that coming into it, I was skeptical.  SO much hype, so much buzz, so much chatter about how wonderful and fantastic and lovely this book is.could it really hold up to that? Could it deliver as promised?  Oh yes.yes it could. It does. It did. Room is -spectacular- on so many levels.

The story is told from the point of view of Jack, a 5 year old little boy who has never seen the world beyond that of the single room in which he and his mother live.  His world consists of that room, his Ma, and the fantasy land inside the television.  It's amazing how spot on the author was able to portray a curious, intelligent, and yet very socially handicapped young child.  His voice was so plaintive, so real, that it makes the reader want to reach into the pages and hug him close.

I could just go on and on about every tiny little thing that I absolutely loved about this book, but I still don't think that I could really do it justice.  The novel just packs such a huge emotional punch that you really have to read it yourself to experience the beauty of the author's story.  Read Room.  You will absolutely not regret it."

You can go into any bookstore and buy this book for $8 for paperback and used bookstore can get it for $2 - $4, yet the digital download is $16.  I buy brand new bestsellers for less than that.  Don't know what the publisher is thinking here.  I know the price is set by the publisher and not B&N because they all are that way so not blaming B&N.  The publisher needs to learn something about the cost savings for digital downloads because there is no reason why the digital version should cost twice as much as the paperback version."

Dune (Dune Chronicles #1),0340839937,Frank Herbert,Barnes and Noble,4.6,¿¿¿¿¿,"Frank Herbert did not simply write a great science fiction novel; he created an entire universe of amazing detail that is filled with characters so well developed that they become real enough to be believed -- no matter how very different they are from our own selves.  Herbert laid a fabric of many plot lines, intrigues, and twists that the reader might become intractably enmeshed in the worlds of Dune eagerly and anxiously awaiting the next book in the series (as the Dune universe has been lovingly and skillfully continued by Frank's son Brian and his writing partner, Kevin J. Anderson).  When I first read Dune back in 1987 I was so strongly attracted that I finished it in a day and a half, and then immediately began reading the remaining four books of the then extant series inside of four days.  A rare thing for me.  

One should regard Dune as a master classic of scifi on par with any of the great scifi writers:  Asimov, Heinlein, etc."
The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference,0316346624,Malcolm Gladwell,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"The book is about the ""tipping point"", that is, that moment when an idea or social behaviour has reached a level where it ""tips"" and spreads like crazy. The book makes sense about how these things happen by using three rules- The Law of the Few, The Stickiness Factor, and the Power of Context. Taking three rules, then, the book uses them to explain seemingly puzzling epidemic situations in society such as teen smoking or bestsellers. Fun and interesting, if this kind of topic appeals to you, you'll like the book- its well written and an easy read. Other books that might appeal to general interest readers include The Sixty-Second Motivator"
The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference,0316346624,Malcolm Gladwell,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"Malcolm Gladwell, the author of The Tipping Point, explores the phenomenon known as the tipping point. According to Gladwell the tipping point is the moment at which ""an idea, trend, or social behavior crosses a treshold, tips, and spreads like wildfire"". In other words, the point when an idea, trend, or behavior becomes an sensation to the world. Gladwell researches the behaviors of fashion trends, crime rate, and best selling novels to explain how small, yet powerful changes can result in an tipping point.

Gladwell compares the idea of the tipping point to an epidemic of the flu. A simple sneeze from a sick person can start a flu epidemic just as a word of mouth can make an restaurant a big success. Gladwell seperates his book into the three rules of epidemics. The law of the few, the stickiness factor, and the power of context each explain how and why an idea, trend, or behavior results in an epidemic.

Gladwell uses examples such as Paul Revere's midnight ride to support his ideas on epidemics. Malcolm Gladwell states that ""Paul Revere's ride is perhaps the most famous historial example of a word-of-mouth epidemic"". Gladwell continues by calling Paul Revere a connector, a person who is truly socially diverse. Revere was able contact an abundant amount of people because he was connected with a large amount of diverse people. According to Gladwell, the message itself has to be sticky enough to make people listen and respond. The message ""the British are coming"" was a sticky phrase that made the message itself important enough to respond to. Malcolm Gladwell's context law states at the enviroment at which a message is sent also makes an impact. Paul Revere sent his message in the evening because the majority of people are sleeping and when they are woken up by a noise they are more susceptible to listen.

The Tipping Point is a brilliantly written book that will change your outlook on famous fashion trends, falling crime rates, and the success of best selling novels. Malcolm Gladwell uses interesting examples throughout to make his book an enjoyable read. By the end of this book Gladwell will make you believe that any immovable object can be tipped if it is pushed in the right place."
The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference,0316346624,Malcolm Gladwell,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Chantalaimee,This book was very intriguing in explaining the causes of fads and why things get popular. The examples talked about are really interesting like how Sesame Street came to be and what makes a sales person so successful. Gladwell uses examples to make his point fully comprehendible and interesting. He explains and analyzes studies of human behavior to conclude to several rules about the tipping point of products. It is a book worth reading! :D
Steve Jobs,1451648537,Walter Isaacson,Barnes and Noble,4.2,bulbrandt,"I bought this book after seeing a promotional interview with Walter Isaacson and this book. I didn't know much about Steve Jobs or Apple. I have not been an avid Apple products devotee. This is a wonderful book! I found it to be a compelling read and had a hard time putting it down. Mr. Isaacson is a really good writer and I now plan on reading his biography of Benjamin Franklin. I now know that Steve Jobs was a very interesting individual following his own head and heart. Isaacson writing is SMOOTH. It is succinct, but not boringly so, treating Job's sometimes not so great personality characteristics as honestly as he treated his very good traits and his genius. And apparently both Jobs and his wife wanted it that way which was very wise on their part. To do otherwise would have been a mockery of his life. If Isaacson had an agenda while writing this book or about Jobs it doesn't come out in the book. I felt no tug pulling me toward or against Jobs. This is one of those books that stays with you. Fascinating man! It made me feel that I/we may be missing out because of the mediocrity that is so prevalent in this country. There just are not a lot of Jobs's around, we discourage them. One thing I wish Isaacson had given us. Some sense of what it was like for Jobs to grow up in his rather conventional family without having his unconventional genius squashed. From what little was said they sound like they were suppportive, but I would like to hear some details. Can you imagine if some little boy like Jobs was in your child's elementary school? How many of these creative geniuses are molded into conformity? Excellent read - buy it!"
Steve Jobs,1451648537,Walter Isaacson,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Ahmed Raza,The only Steve Jobs biography which exposes Steve Jobs completely in terms of his work and personal philosophy. We finally know Steve as a mortal through this book.
Steve Jobs,1451648537,Walter Isaacson,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Kuasol1,"This is a very comprehensive book that details all aspects of Steve Jobs life and work bar one. Details about his formative years are sketchy. Walter Isaacson did not interview the one living person, adopted sister Patty Jobs, who could enlighten him more about interactions in the Jobs household that helped form Steve Jobs. Living relatives of Paul or Clara Jobs, his adoptive parents, were also not interviewed. Isaacson places more emphasis upon his biological parents. It seems that the literary works of Mona Simpson, Jobs biological sister, over influenced Isaacson. Even when there is a strong father figure in a home, mothers do help to form their children's personality. Clara Jobs gets no more than a few lines in a 600+ page book. Patty Jobs is mentioned only once or twice in passing. Research shows that she is still living and works at De Anza College in the payroll department, a position similar to that of her late mother. Hopefully a later biography will delve more thoroughly into Steve Jobs formative years."
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,0451163966,Ken Kesey,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Meagan_Traver,"The novel One Flew Over a Cuckoo¿s Nest is a dark, classic book that describes the journey of ex-prisoner Randle Patrick McMurphy and how he shakes up the life of a mental hospital after being sentenced as a patient himself. He claims to be insane but quickly shows his rebellious persona by challenging authority in the ward with his dramatic way to take over. The book maps his constant battle with the big nurse Ratched who is the overseeing power of the institution. Their combative ways is an eye-opening and compelling story line that shows the era of the 1960¿s was way different from today. The repetitive themes found in the book are standing up for one¿s self even if it is against a higher power and of course surviving the cruel, brain frying punishments executed in the disturbed ward. McMurphy is a brute and forceful man that has to push nurse Ratched¿s boundaries and break the rules to keep him from actually going crazy. I found myself riveted with the storyline and always wanting to turn the page to read what scheme McMurphy had dreamt up next to put into action. His interactions with the other patients was humorous and gave a clear picture of what life must have been like living with such twisted and physiologically disturbed people. McMurphy might not be considered the stereotyped ¿Hero¿ but is a timeless character who you want to see succeed nevertheless. Author Ken Kessey was not disillusioned into creating tragic endings. It is not a book for a younger audience or a feel good time. This book can measure up into being one of the greatest horror stories written and a perfect read during the Halloween season. If you enjoy this book as much as I did, I would recommend the following novels that give off the same eerie but page turning thrill; 1984 by George Orwell, Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, Go ask Alice by Anonymous, or 13 Reasons Why by Jay Asher. This book was an impeccable piece of writing with a shining 5 star quality. It is a longer read but the pages fly as the novel steadily peaks to the climax and shocking ending."
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,0451163966,Ken Kesey,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"For starters, I have this strange curiosity about psychology; coincidentally we were assigned outside ready in my English class and to my delight a Ken Kesey novel was on that list, One Flew Over the Cuckoo¿s Nest.  I went into the book without many expectations other than the fact that I was excited to read it, I fell in love.  Not only does Kesey refrain from shying away from saying something vulgar and true, he shines a light on what many don¿t want to see.  Based on semi-non-fictional experiences, Kesey offers a glimpse into a psychiatric ward in the late 1950s.  Many things are learned throughout the novel such as brutal ways patients were treated with, the head nurse exercising a totalitarian rule over the ward and that not all the patients are crazy rather they have tendencies that are different from the norm.  I really loved the novel and I highly recommend it as a ¿must read¿ because it touched topics that most people would not think of on a normal basis and really made you question the definition of insanity."
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,0451163966,Ken Kesey,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Dan Combs,"very interesting take on the treatments of the mentally ill.  sometimes funny, other time ver harsh.  a slow read, but a must read."
The Name of the Rose,0156001314,"Umberto Eco, William Weaver, Seán Barrett",Barnes and Noble,4.1,DrJimC,"This is an excellent book, but I feel it useful to provide editing feedback in this early stage of eBooks.  The maps of the abbey and the library are poorly transferred to the eBook format.  In both cases, only the upper left corner of each of these maps are visible on the BN nook.  This does not seriously detract from this fantastic novel, but I was disappointed by the seeming lack of effort to format these images appropriately for the nook."
The Name of the Rose,0156001314,"Umberto Eco, William Weaver, Seán Barrett",Barnes and Noble,4.1,william_deeds,"If I were asked which book had greatly impacted my intellectuality, I would say it was ""The Name of the Rose"" by Umberto Eco.  Even though the book was very challenging and complex, the literary elements used (in the novel) made it a very well written book.  It entertained me for five complete days in which I was successfully forced to isolate myself from the world, only to live this medieval experience at its best.  After reading those exhausting first 100 pages (that were the most challenging from the entire book) in which the abbey was being described with excessive detail, I really got hooked up even more.  The plot advanced extremely fast after these first 100 pages, and before I even knew it, I was finishing the novel with tremendous pride.  After reading ""The Name of the Rose"" everything was worth it; all my time, my effort, etc. invested gave their respective ""healthy fruits"".

Many appropriate elements in the book, not seen in any other book, successfully made me feel as if I were part of the most intriguing era: the medieval era.  The Latin phrases disseminated throughout the text, the magnificent descriptions of the abbey, the historical context in which this book took place in, but especially, the ideas expressed in the book, were the elements that made this book superior from the others to such a level that a movie was made to fulfill the vast excellence of this work (although the movie is not as good as the book).  The author also used an opportune book structure throughout the text that was historically used by the medieval intellectuals (the scholars).  When they wrote books, the medieval scholars used summaries at the beginning of each chapter, and this made me feel (even more) as if I were part of the medieval era.  

All the ideas, superstitions, beliefs, etc, exposed in the book really made me think seriously.  It is extremely interesting how the author combined religion and philosophy in the book.  For instance, the blind scholar Jorge of Burgos feverously made a very profound point about religion that came in hand with the philosophy of life (or existentialism).  Jorge played a huge roll in the novel using, as a justification for his actions, the seriousness of life (not laughing at anything since it is a great offense to God).  This was the main point (with many more) were philosophy and religion of the medieval era fought against each other, and this combination really left me pondering a lot.  Besides this, the book carried out the idea of history throughout its plot, which I really liked. This historical consistency seen throughout the novel gave me a very high-quality history lesson about a specific part of the medieval era.  

This is a very well written book that should be read only when you feel intellectually and physically strong enough (since this book is not that simple and requires quite a lot of time).  I sincerely recommend, and it's a must read book. Waste no more time, and READ IT NOW!"
The Name of the Rose,0156001314,"Umberto Eco, William Weaver, Seán Barrett",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"I had no idea when I picked up this random book hiding on a shelf in a bookstore that I would not be able to put it down for 2 weeks. It blows Tolken's books out of the water. I didn't think I could find a better mystery than A Tale of Two Cities, but did I ever."
Go Ask Alice,1416914633,"Beatrice Sparks, Anonymous",Barnes and Noble,4.5,SamanthaRenae91,"I think that many people will appreciate this book and will find it helpful in understanding the life of a drug addict. This book makes people see the other side of an addict, they can really get to know alice in the book. And not just as a drug addit but as a person who is struggling to be a better person for herself and for her family. 

I think everyone should read this fantastic book."
Go Ask Alice,1416914633,"Beatrice Sparks, Anonymous",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Sara-Stewart,"Most of us know by now that this is not a ""true"" diary, but a fiction. Nevertheless, it's highly entertaining as a cautionary tale of drugs and a teenage descent into hell. It reminds me a lot of the German film, CHRISTIANE F. -- another story of a downward spiral into oblivion due to drugs. In many ways, it also reminds me of a 1970s' ""movie of the week"" -- and in fact a movie does exist of this (and it even features William Shatner); though I haven't seen it. 

This is a terrific book for those with a morbid curiosity (like myself) about drug addiction and runaways. It's a dark entertainment and a dark fantasy that poses the question: What if? (What if I allowed myself to go there?)

It's like a death wish in many ways. But I do recommend it -- I kept wanting to see how far it would go -- and if it would end tragically. Some have found the writing to be less than spectacular, but I don't care: I was fine with it. For a so-called ""young adult"" book, it's edgy. 

It's also a period piece in many ways. A peek into the drug culture during the late hippy days (not to sound disparaging). It has that hippy culture-gone-bad vibe.

Recommended (for unconventional readers)."
Go Ask Alice,1416914633,"Beatrice Sparks, Anonymous",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"I read this the first time in my late teens...20 years ago!  I remembered really enjoying the book, but couldn't remember the specifics of it.  So when I recently came accrossed it again, I re-read it.  It was just as good 20 years later!! Definately a classic!! And in a few years when my daughter is old enough, I will reccomend it to her!

And although some have questioned weather this book is an actual diary or a work of fiction, I don't believe it makes much difference. Fact is, this HAS happened, CAN happen and sadly, will continue to happen girls/young women....."
A Confederacy of Dunces,0802130208,"John Kennedy Toole, Walker Percy",Barnes and Noble,4.1,bossbaggs,"Ignatius J. Reilly, Toole's main character in this hilarious tour de force, stands alone atop the heap of modern anti-heroes.  After reading Confederacy, one never encounters the wackiness of life without asking, ""What would Ignatius do?""  This book, testimony to Toole's brave genius, takes aim at the twin inanities of multiculturalism and political correctness, years before they fouled our national consciousness.  Don't get me wrong. Toole is absolutely fair and even-handed: everybody gets theirs in this fearless and funny book.  The plot is tight.  The action is fast-paced.  The characters are memorable.  The ending is madly happy.  And along the way, every page is crammed with humor, insight and deeply appreciative humanity.  Long live JK Toole!  Long live Ignatius!"
A Confederacy of Dunces,0802130208,"John Kennedy Toole, Walker Percy",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Atticus_Caufield,"I'll say it: Reading A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole wasn't always a pleasant experience for me. I was equal parts sympathetic, frustrated, and just outright incredulous at the actions of its main character, Ignatius J. Reilly. In truth, that is probably a testament to Kennedy Toole's unique voice and vision of a well-drawn character never before seen in the likes of literature. It's what Kennedy Toole doesn't say about Reilly and his thought process that becomes most frustrating and compelling. Is he just really very spoiled and sheltered? Completely out of touch? Mentally ill? It's all left up in the air like some of the best poetry, and spaces are left for the reader to bring their own meaning to the proceedings.

A Confederacy of Dunces isn't the most compelling read as far as plot development or symbolism. You're more likely to glean more meaning from Aesop's Fables, but it should be required reading to experience a unique voice and style, and just one more facet of American Literature.

The story, so detailed throughout, ends abruptly, and this reader thinks the story would've continued on or spawned a sequel, had the author not tragically ended his own life. Which begs another question, of course...how much of John Kennedy Toole lives in Ignatius?"
A Confederacy of Dunces,0802130208,"John Kennedy Toole, Walker Percy",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"'A green hunting cap squeezed the top of the fleshy balloon of a head. The green earflaps, full of large ears and uncut hair and the fine bristles that grew in the ears themselves, stuck out on either side like turn signals indicating two directions at once. Full, pursed lips protruded beneath the bushy black moustache and, at their corners, sank into little folds filled with disapproval and potato chip crumbs.'    Meet Ignatius J. Reilly, the hero of John Kennedy Toole's tragicomic tale, A Confederacy of Dunces. This 30-year-old medievalist lives at home with his mother in New Orleans, pens his magnum opus on Big Chief writing pads he keeps hidden under his bed, and relays to anyone who will listen the traumatic experience he once had on a Greyhound Scenicruiser bound for Baton Rouge. ('Speeding along in that bus was like hurtling into the abyss.') But Ignatius's quiet life of tyrannizing his mother and writing his endless comparative history screeches to a halt when he is almost arrested by the overeager Patrolman Mancuso--who mistakes him for a vagrant--and then involved in a car accident with his tipsy mother behind the wheel. One thing leads to another, and before he knows it, Ignatius is out pounding the pavement in search of a job.    Over the next several hundred pages, our hero stumbles from one adventure to the next. His stint as a hotdog vendor is less than successful, and he soon turns his employers at the Levy Pants Company on their heads. Ignatius's path through the working world is populated by marvelous secondary characters: the stripper Darlene and her talented cockatoo  the septuagenarian secretary Miss Trixie, whose desperate attempts to retire are constantly, comically thwarted  gay blade Dorian Greene  sinister Miss Lee, proprietor of the Night of Joy nightclub  and Myrna Minkoff, the girl Ignatius loves to hate. The many subplots that weave through A Confederacy of Dunces are as complicated as anything you'll find in a Dickens novel, and just as beautifully tied together in the end. But it is Ignatius--selfish, domineering, and deluded, tragic and comic and larger than life--who carries the story. He is a modern-day Quixote beset by giants of the modern age. His fragility cracks the shell of comic bluster, revealing a deep streak of melancholy beneath the antic humor. John Kennedy Toole committed suicide in 1969 and never saw the publication of his novel. Ignatius Reilly is what he left behind, a fitting memorial to a talented and tormented life"

It's the only written work that's ever had me laughing out loud in public--Oscar Wilde is an incredibly witty man.  He makes great use of snappy banter, the occasional satirical reference to real-world social issues, and puns (such as the one in the title itself), but never comes on too strong, as many comedies can tend to do.

Overall, I loved this book all the way through, and in my opinion is the best book Mr. Riordan has written so far in his mythological stories. The characters are totally realistic teenagers, and some moments, I sympathized, and empathized with them. Many times during reading I have laughed out loud, or cried with the characters. I felt like I was part of every moment. I will definitely read this again and I hope the next book, lives up to this one. The next book has big shoes to fill, but I think Mr. Riordan manage it."
"The Color of Magic (Discworld, #1; Rincewind #1)",0060855924,Terry Pratchett,Barnes and Noble,4,Kasia_S,"I've been collecting the Discworld books in no particular order for a few years now, mostly because my father always had an affinity for them and recommended them as hilarious and entertaining at the same time. Now that I finally got to read the first in the series I can see what the fuss is all about! There is plenty of humor, dry wit and magic, extremely complex scientific and fantastic themes and myriad of characters brighter than all the rainbows and flowers in the world combined. My head was spinning after few pages but somehow I couldn't stop reading; this incredible journey that Pratchett invites the reader on takes some time to get adjusted to, but once I let my mind go and read it slow, it all melted into a fantasy like no other. I can't really imagine kids reading it unless they are prodigies at understanding language because their little brains might pop from the amount of information given; I know mine was taken for a spin a few times! So here we are, visiting a world that exists as a flat disc with water walling over the edges, carried by four giant elephants standing on an ancient turtle, covered in meteor holes and all sorts of space debris, swimming who knows where....In one of it's cities, Ankh-Morpork , a failed wizard by the name of Rincewind comes across Twoflower, a traveling little man with magical luggage, carved out of rare sapient pear tree that follows him everywhere on its tiny feet. Yes walking luggage, with teeth too, guarding his master and providing lots of entertainment through out the story. The two men are the only ones in the whole city who speak the same language and thus their zany adventures start. Hastily hired as a guide the magician, who sucks at magic but it awfully funny and likable, gets into all sorts of troubles with trolls, dragons, islands with lunatics chased by Death itself without trying to loose poor Twoflower who thinks the whole adventure as a great sight seeing trip, they escape all sorts of scenarios that take them form the murkiest depths of underwater caves into far away galaxies in deep space. Seems like a lot and it is, but the novel takes all sorts of turns ad twists and one never knows what awaits our heroes on the next page. When Gods play magic dice and Fate and Death are in talks of getting them, our characters have a lot at stake and loosing such charming little fellows would certainly be horrible so the reader is constantly kept on a tight leash as the beauty of the story and its intricate pattern morphs into more fantastic scenarios. I can't even clearly say what this book is about other than being simply fantastic, albeit very complex. Folklore, mythology, fairy tales, comedy and drama, it's all here exquisitely woven for those who dare. - Kasia S."

Kafka on the Shore,1400079276,"Haruki Murakami, Philip Gabriel",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"The style of the book reminded me a bit of Kurt Vonnegut's style. I read it within 3 days and I keep thinking about it. Although everything isn't answered in the story, I think it's enough to keep the reader more than satisfied (after all it makes the reader think about it more). It's so different from the other things I've been reading lately that I just find it refreshing and intriguing."
Kafka on the Shore,1400079276,"Haruki Murakami, Philip Gabriel",Barnes and Noble,4.2,CR-Buell,"Murakami is one of our greatest living authors, and in my opinion this is his masterpiece.  Kafka on the Shore is so beautiful and so surreal it will leave you haunted for days.  The characters are so masterfully crafted that they will become a part of you.  The existentialist themes are so profound that they will change you.  This book is designed to make you think, and more importantly, to make you feel.  And it does both those things, powerfully."
Kafka on the Shore,1400079276,"Haruki Murakami, Philip Gabriel",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Breeze_in_Austin,"Escaping the bounds of reality seems so simple in this amazing book by Japanese author Haruki Murakami, one of today's most original and mind-bending writers.  The translation from Japanese to English is absolutely stunning as the language is both vivid and detailed.  Following the story of a 15-year old boy as he finds his way through the mysteries of life, Murakami crafts a story that jolts the reader from concrete feelings to far-fetched imagery.  Let go of what you expect and know of the world and allow yourself to venture into this meandering tale full of surprising twists and turns.  Murakami's greatest feat is his ability to make what is surely impossible seem so real and lifelike - from a man who can talk to cats, to strange characters who resemble familiar characters from modern day product marketing like Johnny Walker and Colonel Sanders.  The tale is told in such a way as to suggest a dreamlike state where life isn't what you expect, and is much more vivid than we normally allow.  

Not a love story, exactly.  Not a coming of age parable, either.  Not a thriller or mystery.  And yet, it weaves together elements of all of these into one masterful piece of writing that will keep you glued to the pages.  Set in modern-day Japan, the story is filled with contemporary references, making the situations seem entirely plausible.  But as the plot twists and meanders, it is clear that what you are reading requires a suspension of reality and a willingness to take in the well-crafted writing as merely a different way to see things.  

Kafka Tamura finds love and adventure as he fights to uncover the power of his father's oedipal prophecy.  As he travels Japan as a runaway, he finds himself wondering if his path is chosen for him as fate, or if he is living a life of coincidence.  While wondering, but not searching, for the mother who left him as a young child, his only sister gone with her, he discovers much more than he bargained for.  

Having lived in Japan, the descriptions of the people and the places immediately drew me back to times spent in this friendly, yet oftentimes exotic locale.  Reading Kafka on the Shore made Japan seem less foreign, and more strange at the same time.  The language is compelling, even as it has been translated to English - a notable feat not generally achieved.  

Murakami will be regarded as one of the world's most unique and creative fiction writers and Kafka on the Shore is the perfect example of all he brings to the written page."
"Red Dragon (Hannibal Lecter, #1)",0525945563,Thomas Harris,Barnes and Noble,4.3,ChesterfieldWatts,"This is the true masterpiece of an author more well-known for a different book. I read ""Red Dragon"" before reading ""Silence of the Lambs"" or seeing any of the movies. I could not put it down, and it kept me on the edge of my seat. When I saw the movies, I was disappointed by the way they failed to capture the suspense Thomas Harris creates in the book. The characters are richly developed, and Harris makes it very easy to empathize with the characters. Whether you have seen the movies or not, this is a great read. The writing is masterful, and the characters are richer and more developed than in ""Silence of the Lambs."" A great book for those looking for a suspenseful read."
"Red Dragon (Hannibal Lecter, #1)",0525945563,Thomas Harris,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"Thomas Harris has been one of those pleasant suprises for me.  I only read 'Red Dragon' because my wife was busy reading and praising 'Hannibal'and I am not a patient man. The central plot of the book involves two FBI types, Jack Crawford (of 'Silence of the Lambs') and Will Graham ( a retired civilian specialist with a knack for catching serial killers)chasing one Francis Dolarhyde, a bonafide twisted soul who kills families. The narrative prose is elegant, effortless and exciting and presents the case and the chase in a style so smooth and transparent that Harris hardly ever gets in the way of his own writing. I have always liked this ability in a storyteller.  But more importantly, Harris has a remarkable gift for writing deeply in and out of the characters' souls while weaving the unfolding arc of the story in a revealing way about their formative histories. It's easy to write about events, but much harder to create psycho-biography which engages and holds the reader. This is Harris' true gift. He begets utterly 'knowable' characters. One is left exhausted and sad at the end, but with a sense of not having been cheated by the effort of reading  because we know the killer so well. We even...dare I say it...understand him and why he is such a brutally disfigured personality. That's refreshing. (Did I really say refreshing?) I will look forward to 'Hannibal' and all subsequent Harris works with enthusiasm."
"Red Dragon (Hannibal Lecter, #1)",0525945563,Thomas Harris,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,The thing about this novel was it was by far better than the movie. But the thing is that you should really read the book before watching the movie. When i read the book after seeing the movie i was dissapointed as to how the plot moved a tad slowly and seemed to drag on. It was certainly enthralling though and a great read.
"I, Robot (Robot #0.1)",0553803700,Isaac Asimov,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"IMPORTANT: The book does not resemble the movie in any great detail.
This is a must read for SF fans out there, packed in a very affordable package."
"I, Robot (Robot #0.1)",0553803700,Isaac Asimov,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Justint,"I, Robot by Isaac Asimov is made up of a series of nine science fiction short stories that all are connected through a robot psychologist named Dr. Susan Calvin.  The stories are told as if Susan Calvin is relaying them to a reporter, the narrator.  The first story, ¿Robbie¿ is about a young girl who has a robot friend, but her mother disapproves of the relationship.  Her mother tries desperately to keep them away from each other.  In the next few stories, we are told of two scientists who are distraught with problems in development of labor robots.  The two come across danger while trying to relieve the issues almost costing them their lives in the process.  A common thread among each story is the Three Law of Robotics, which underlines and governs the way robots should behave as well as the interaction of humans and robots.  In the next five stories, Susan Calvin is the main character and the stories talk about the evolution of robots.  The stories also talk about her removal from humanity.  She retreats due to a mind-reading robot that discovers her romantic feelings for a fellow colleague.  Throughout the novel the robots show intelligence and understanding which in some cases surpasses that of the humans.  Soon the humans begin to realize that the robots may have more power then they themselves have.  Their ability to deduce and analyze creates a major problem for the humans and it seems as though the robots could remove the humans.  After their creation it is evident that the increasing knowledge of the robots will be too much for the humans.  Isaac Asimov wrote a break through novel many years ahead of its time.  His creativity and shear brilliance is shown through his attention to detail and development of the story as a whole.  It is good read for anyone interested in the mind versus machine aspect of entertainment."
"I, Robot (Robot #0.1)",0553803700,Isaac Asimov,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"The book is pretty old, and has a few plot holes, but it's still very entertaining and makes you think a bit.    Note that while the movie claims to be based on Asimov's books, that's a big fat lie.  The movie takes two elements from these short stories: robots, and the Three Laws of Robotics.  That's it.  The inclusion of the movie picture on the cover of the new edition is a travesty.  It would be more appropriate to put the poster from Mel Gibson's 'Passion' movie on the cover of the Bible -- hey, at least they have some characters and story elements in common!"
"Dark Lover (Black Dagger Brotherhood, #1)",0451216954,J.R. Ward,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"Dark Lover is my first read of a vampire storyline. I couldn't put it down. I admit I had few expectations of a romance sort of novel and even less for a story about a group of vampires. I was shocked at the detailed world the author has created, and she presents unique attributes to her vampires that extend beyond those typically found in popular culture. Like, their preferences for vampire blood and not human blood! I ended up reading the entire series and loved every book. This book drew me in, and even though I found the book somewhat profane in its use of language, it didn't detract at all from the overall quality of the book. I will say that if you are bothered by graphic sex and language, this book (series) might be hard for you to read. Having said that, there is much more to this book than the sex and rough language. Overall, excellent!"
"Dark Lover (Black Dagger Brotherhood, #1)",0451216954,J.R. Ward,Barnes and Noble,4.5,StephanieD,"Dark Lover was my first paranormal romance. I had a LOT of reservations and I was positive there was no way vampires could in any sense of the word be sexy or romantic. In fact, my mother had read all the books and loved them. But I stuck to my case, no way was I going to like this book. Well, I can say with no shame, that J.R. Ward proved me wrong. I loved it and can't wait to read the other 5.	Dark Lover is about a woman who is about to go through her transisition and the sexy vampire who is going to help her through it. There is a lot of action as far as the Brotherhood having to protect there species. There is a lot of steamy scenes that will probably knock your socks off too. If you have any reservations about reading this book, just give the first book a try. It may change your mind."
"Dark Lover (Black Dagger Brotherhood, #1)",0451216954,J.R. Ward,Barnes and Noble,4.5,EverlastingWolf,"This is the best romance vampire series I have ever read and probably will ever read! 

When I read the first page, I was compelled to continue and not just because of the steamy hot guys. I was almost certain, it had to be because I was holding my breath with anticipation and tension. I think it was also because of the way they introduced Wrath. 

These series are rare because the relationships linger on the edge of a dagger. Between rough and tender. Beautiful and cruel. Love and Hate. Reminding us all, that you can still find beauty in the dark.  

I'm completely taken with this series and I will certaintly be reading them outloud to my Wrath! 

I cannot thank the author enough!
Please read this, you will never put it down!"
"Crescendo (Hush, Hush, #2)",1416989439,Becca Fitzpatrick,Barnes and Noble,4.5,EllzReadz,"My thoughts...Crescendo starts with the mysterious death of Nora's Dad, then quickly picks up where Hush, Hush leaves off.  If you have not read Hush, Hush, I recommend you read it before Crescendo. 

Some things did not change between the two books.  First, Patch is still shady.  I still have a hard time trusting him and I lost my connection with his character.  While I want to believe he has Nora's best interests at heart, his actions at times are very hard to swallow.  I want to cry into my pillow for the pain he causes her.  Secondly, the evil character of Marcie is still around causing havoc.  Actually she is ten times worse in Crescendo, if that is even possible.  Book two does offer some insight into why she is so cruel.  

Fitzpatrick does a great job of writing Nora's character in this book.  She acts her age, making reckless decisions, and speaking without thinking.  Her jealousy is written in a way I could relate to, many of us could.  Her character also shows quite a bit of growth.  She is a lot more confident and street smart.  

Crescendo fills in a lot of blanks from Hush, Hush.  These details provide a larger picture of Fitzpatrick's world.  Nora is still a magnet for trouble, which takes readers on an adventure.  Parts of the story were are scary in a way that makes you want to leave the lights on and check under the bed.  The ending of the story surprised me a bit and left me hanging.  I am eager to continue reading as Nora is already in a heap of trouble."
"Crescendo (Hush, Hush, #2)",1416989439,Becca Fitzpatrick,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Mehlah,"I am ashamed to say the original reason I bought the first (hush, hush)book was the amazing cover art. But the book it's self was amazing as well. I read the whole thing in about 1 day. The characters are surprisingly relatable and I must say that PATCH is one ""Hawt Piece Of Work!!"" Haahaa!! And Nora's best friend Vee... HILARIOUS!!! Becca Fitzpatrick is a fantastic writer and I look forward to see where she will take her series. Becca!! you have a fan for life!! (so far)"

Since im completley against books with and kind of sexual interactions anymore than kissing. I made the mistake of going through with books worse (i mean with sexual interactions, not the plot or story) and it made me very umcomfortable. 

I had not wanted something with swearing, smoking or drinking in it either. The story itself was fine, but it still made me wish i hadn't bought it. 

If you dont want something with that stuff in it, don't get this book. If you aren't bothered by that, then but it, because it still has a good story."

The God of Small Things,0679457313,Arundhati Roy,Barnes and Noble,4,SandyID,"This book is skillfully written showing how difficult life can become for children and their parents when traditions and familiar things are changed forever as the influence of a great nation brings its own forms of education and traditions to bear on another great but politically weaker nation.  The needs of the young and helpless must not be overlooked and dealt with harshly and indifferently in these circumstances, as the authoress cleverly and clearly portrays."
The God of Small Things,0679457313,Arundhati Roy,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"I really don't understand where the bad reviews are coming from. In all honesty, this is not a light read, but its genius! Roy's syntax and diction further highlight the tradgic events of the story.  It is dazzling - I couldn't put it down! I found myself thinking about it even when I wasn't reading it. It's perfect."
The God of Small Things,0679457313,Arundhati Roy,Barnes and Noble,4,cloggiedownunder,"The God of Small Things, the first (and so far, only) novel by Indian writer, Arundhati Roy, was written between 1992 and 1996. This (semi-autobiographical) story takes place in the village of Ayemenem and the town of Kottayam, near Cochin in Kerala, and is set principally during two time periods: December 1969 and 23 years later. The main characters are Esthappen (Estha) and Rahel, seven-year-old two-egg (i.e. non-identical) twins, and their mother Ammu. Ammu falls in love with Velutha Paapen, a Paraven (Untouchable) who works for the family&rsquo;s Pickle Factory, a man the twins already list amongst their most-loved. But even in 1969, with a Communist Government, parts of India are still firmly in the grip of the Caste system. By breaking the &quot;Love Laws,&quot; or &quot;The laws that lay down who should be loved, and how. And how much&rdquo;, Ammu and the twins set in motion &ldquo;The Terror&rdquo;. The manipulations of Ammu&rsquo;s aunt, Baby Kochamma, are instrumental in bringing down The Terror, and her subsequent cruelty to Ammu and the twins will leave readers gasping. 
As well as commenting on the Caste system and Class discrimination in general, the novel examines Indian history and politics, the taboos of conventional society, and religion. But more than anything, this is a story about love and betrayal. 
The innocent observations of 7-year-olds, their interpretation of unfamiliar words and phrases, the (typically Indian) Capitalisation of Significant Words, the running together of and splitting apart of words , the phonetic spelling, all are a source of humour and delight in this novel. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an afternoon-mare&rdquo;, Estha-the-Accurate replied. &ldquo;She dreams a lot&rdquo;. Even as Estha is being molested by the Orangedrink Lemondrink man in the Abhilash Talkies, his observations (&ldquo;Not a moonbeam.&rdquo;) bring laughter. Echoes, repetitions and resonances abound. Roy is a master of the language: &ldquo;So futile. Like polishing firewood.&rdquo; Her prose is luminous. This novel is powerful, moving, tragic. Beautifully written, with wonderful word pictures.
This novel demands at least two reads: once to learn the story; a second time to appreciate the echoes and repetitions and understand what the early references mean. It deserves a third reading to fully appreciate the prose, the descriptive passages. On this, my third reading, I read parts I would swear I had not read earlier. And I had tears in my eyes very early in the novel. I loved this book when I first read it: I love it even more now. I remain hopeful that Arundhati Roy will share her considerable literary talents with her eager readers in the form of another novel."
The Invention of Wings,0670024783,Sue Monk Kidd,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,I find the &quot;highlighted by Oprah&quot; text to be very distracting to the reading of this book.  I would not have purchased it if I had understood that all the highlighted text would hinder my reading and enjoyment of this book.  Won't purchase books with this &quot;feature&quot; again.  How do I get a copy without the distracting highlighting?
The Invention of Wings,0670024783,Sue Monk Kidd,Barnes and Noble,4.2,RebeccaScaglione,"I received this book from the publisher in exchange for a fair and honest review &ndash; but OMG was I excited when I did receive it because it&rsquo;s an Oprah&rsquo;s Book pick and I read alllll of her choices!

The Invention of Wings by Sue Monk Kidd is the kind of book that makes you want to be a better person.

The newest Oprah&rsquo;s Book Club 2.0 pick is incredibly moving. The story is told in dual narrative, following Sarah Grimke and a slave named Hetty &ldquo;Handful&rdquo; Grimke in the 1800s.

Sarah is given Hetty as a gift for her eleventh birthday, and even at that young age, Sarah believes that slavery is immoral. But Sarah is caught in the Charleston upper class lifestyle and is useless in making a change. So she rebels the way she can, giving Hetty the freedom of literacy.
Sarah evolves, trying to turn into someone she wants to be: a strong, independent woman, but her dreams are pushed down by everyone, including her family.

Only when Sarah leaves the comforts of the South does she truly begin to understand the power that individual voices can have.

At the same time, Hetty changes from young, rebellious slave girl to becoming a strong, still rebellious, woman.

Both Sarah and Hetty&rsquo;s stories are mesmerizing. Hetty is such a strong, spunky character who was so much like her mother: unwilling to bow down to every need and want from the master/missus.

And then Sarah went fully against her own culture and society in order to fight for what she believed in &ndash; equality of all people, no matter the sex or race.

Sue Monk Kidd&rsquo;s The Invention of Wings is a book that makes me want to get out there and make a difference, to take a stand for a cause I truly believe it.

The Invention of Wings is inspirational. So pick up this novel and get a little inspired yourself.

What cause do you think is necessary to fight for?

Thanks for reading,

The only thing that is frustrating for me is that I purchased this for my Nook, and the blue text hyperlinks keep sending me to the Oprah notes at the back of the book!  So you have to be very, very careful when &quot;turning&quot; the pages with the blue hyperlinks....I discovered this when I had to find page 10 four times!!!  Hopefully, the publisher will fix this soon, because otherwise, it is going to take me a really long time to finish this book!"
A Brief History of Time,0553380168,"Stephen Hawking, Cao Chi, Phạm Văn Thiều",Barnes and Noble,4.3,ReadingRedHead,"When I started reading this book, I thought there is no way in the world I will be able to understand one of the greatest minds in physics today. How wrong I was! Dr. Hawking makes complicated theory understandable for the rest of us. This is a fascinating book that I would recommend to everyone."
A Brief History of Time,0553380168,"Stephen Hawking, Cao Chi, Phạm Văn Thiều",Barnes and Noble,4.3,CodyHunt,"Throughout his book, Stephen Hawking presents his outstanding observations and beliefs of the physics of our universe. Hawking presents information on the history of the universe, motion of the universe and most exhilarating of all, black holes. He includes his perception and opinions of the universe and its past as well as the physics acting upon it as time passes He presents the writing in reasonable short chapters that help you understand him and all of his reasoning as well as the tons of background information that he has researched and drawn his observations from. I would recommend this as a read for anyone that has even a slight interest in astronomy and the cosmos. Stephen Hawking teaches you about simple and general astronomy and from that draws major theories that are constantly changing as we learn more about our universe through technological innovations. There are many pages that will have to be read multiple times before you can really understand what he is even talking about. This isn't really a book that you can skim through or you are bound to miss something vital to the theory of relativity or some function of  quantum physics. Since it is so thorough, unlike some books, you WILL put it down. Chances are, you'll throw it down in frustration with Hawking, but you will be rewarded in the end when you realize how blatantly he put some of the most complex thoughts and information accessible to humans. I enjoyed Hawkings sense of humor and voice in his writing. Before I read this book, physics seemed extremely dry and boring but he adds humor and feeling and made me captivated by concepts. I felt like I was sitting in a classroom while I read this, hearing the teachers voice rambling on and on and on about something I didn't really care about until he cracked a joke that I just caught through the blur of boredom. I let out a little chuckle and grin then realize that the subject is exhilarating and fun. I had no dislike from this book, just shock and awe of a new subject that I knew very little about. Irate this book overall, four stars out five because I do not think this book is for everyone, but I loved it and believe that many people could capture some of the ideas in the writing and be surprised with an epiphany of your surroundings and how miniscule we are in the universe and how much else is out there in time and space."

"Fall of Giants (The Century Trilogy, #1)",0525951652,Ken Follett,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Catbluize,"This is the first book of a new series.  Starts with Welsh miners in early 20th century and intermission (ends) in the 1920's.  The interaction historically is wonderful, the characters are extremely varied and it's amazing how they tie together.  Follett goes into great detail of the characters.  The book is very instructional on the politics of the era and the various characters are examples of the points of view of the period and how the politics eventually affect them.

This is not a book you can read 5 pages at a time.  Chapters are 50 pages.  Find a comfortable chair, a good bottle of wine, and plan on a weekend of wonderful reading.  If you're a part of a book club, plan on chapter discussions, they will be extremely stimulating.

IF I had a complaint, it's that the book jumps between the characters.  I plan on reading the book a second time, a character at a time.

A definite for your Library.  You'll want to keep a copy to reread when the second comes out."
"Fall of Giants (The Century Trilogy, #1)",0525951652,Ken Follett,Barnes and Noble,3.6,SanvenFW,"Having had the opportunity to actually read the book, I can tell you that Mr. Follett is spot on yet again. His razor sharp story telling, character development and interwoven storyline are all realized brilliantly. The entanglement of these characters with each other leads to a complex yet seamless journey around the globe. The book is fast paced, almost impossible to put down and sure to be an instant classic! I can not more highly suggest a title, this one was incredible. That being said, while I agree that the eBook price is outrageous, please note that the price is not set by Mr. Follet, it is in fact, set by his publisher. While I can say this book blew me away, I'm do not think I would purchase this title until Penguin decides to stop punishing those of us who have decided to invest in the future of electronic publishing. Book: 5 stars, ebook price: 0 stars."
"Fall of Giants (The Century Trilogy, #1)",0525951652,Ken Follett,Barnes and Noble,3.6,PiratesGold,"To all who have complained about the price of this novel, I will be the first to admit, it is worth every dollar. Fall of Giants falls into the status level of 'Gone with the Wind.' I would have paid $40 to have the experience of reading Margaret Mitchell's timeless classic. Price is relative to all and all will have their different thresholds. I spent twenty dollars to have a fascinating journey into the early 20th century. The same day, I spent twenty dollars on cleaning supplies for my kitchen. Guess which will have the most lasting impact on my life? This is an exceptional story with Follett creating depth into his characters in which very few authors can achieve. The list of characters in the beginning of the novel can be daunting but Follett introduces his characters to the reader as if they were part of your family. You understand their thought process and inner workings to the point where emotions are evoked, similar to the way family members evoke certain emotions at Thanksgiving... for better or worse. This historical fiction has the abilty to open eyes to the complicated yet simplistic world of politics. Find a weekend with no commitments then buy this novel, a bathtub shelf, bubble bath, and a bottle of wine. On Monday, tell me what the price is to your mind and soul, of having the opportunity to enjoy the luxuries of a warm bath with an amazing novel."
Under the Dome,1439148503,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4,Freekman993,"Please hold your critiques until you've read the book.  I had the privilege to get my hands on an advance copy and I've been singing this story's praises to everyone.  King brings the town of Chester's Mills to vivid life, examining the deepest, darkest secrets of the town.  Early on, a character makes a reference to Golding's Lord of the Flies; if only they had such luck.  The story could happen in any town, and that is what makes it so terrifying and engaging.  Under the Dome is long, but it seems he could have  doubled the length and still left you wanting more.  I recommend taking off a few days after the release of this book, because you will not want to waste time eating, bathing, or going to work until you've turned the final page."
Under the Dome,1439148503,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4,Encharion,"I'll be honest.  I haven't been a fan of King's last couple of novels.  With the exception of, ""Just After Sunset"". His books have been slow at best.

This is not true with ""Under The Dome""  I too got the chance to read the advance copy and I loved every page of this lavish tome.  The wealth of characters and plot balance perfectly between way too many people to keep track of and too few to hold your attention.  Those of you skeptics who look at the page size and think of how long winded King can be, this is not that book.  It needs to be this size, and I will tell you right now it is worth every minute you spend with it on your lap.  
The only bad thing to say about his newest book is if you leave it sitting on your legs, they may fall asleep-but you'll be too enthralled to notice anyway."
Under the Dome,1439148503,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4,delcobooklover,"I was lucky enough to get my hands on an advance copy. I was initially concerned by the editorial reviews comparing this to The Stand. As a fan of the author, I have read all his works, the good, the bad, and the ugly. Arguably The Stand is King's greatest stand-alone work, Dark Tower connections not-withstanding, but this is darn close to the top. King catches you from page one, with his description of an apparently ordinary morning in The Mill, which quickly becomes extraordinary. The characters drawn in the story are compelling. He shows us a seemingly ordinary American town, whose underbelly is far darker than anyone can imagine. After the dome falls, the dark core of this town quickly overwhelms the good. Some of the characters are twisted and evil. The good folks of The Mill shine through the breakdown of values and social structure. But just as compelling is the effects on the dome on the normal townsfolk. People who are just like the rest of us, but fall in line with the despot in charge. In a week, a Maine town becomes Germany in the 1930's. There are some 3rd act problems in the book, it is not perfect, but it is an exceptional work. The fantastic aspects of the dome aside, this is a great book dealing with the sociology of human goups in a crisis. Like The Stand, you'll grow to love and hate the characters, but you will keep reading. King is truly a master of character developement. I forced myself to read the book in small portions, because King can turn me into a glutton, devouring his work in hours. It is worth the time to enjoy his writing to its fullest. Can't wait to see the cover!"
Snow Crash,0553380958,Neal Stephenson,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"""Snow Crash"" rocks.  What else can you say about a book published in 1992 featuring a heroic protagonist named Hiro Protagonist that incorporated pizza delivery franchises, ninjas, punk rock, linguistics, skateboarding, avatars, mafiosi, glass knives, and gated communities ... and managed to be prescient and coherent without being absurd?  I've read thousands of books, and have never found one more engaging than this."
Snow Crash,0553380958,Neal Stephenson,Barnes and Noble,4.4,DearReader,"Stephenson wrote this book in the late 80's / very early 90's. If you read the book (which is a really great read even if it were written recently) with that in mind, it will give you an extra appreciation for the feats of imagination contained within. The ""internets"" as our fearless leader would call it was certainly in existence at that time, but people, it was accessed via character based, pre-Windows, menu driven applications! 

The story starts with a sci-fi futuristic bang but builds into a really compelling drama/mystery that just gets more and more interesting while introducing one great futuristic notion after another. Eventually he ends up dealing with the origin of human language, the Bible, the Mafia, corporate America, skater culture...but it's not all over the place. It's brilliant. 

I've given this book to at least 10 people, and every last one of them loved it. A slam dunk any time but especially for holiday/summer/travel reading."

With the character of Owen, she shows that you (no pun intended) cannot judge a book by it's cover (or a teen by their clothes or attitude).  There are many layers to people and Ms. Dessen showed each and every one in the amazing story."

Before I Go to Sleep,0062060554,S.J. Watson,Barnes and Noble,3.9,OtotheD,"Every morning when she wakes up, Christine has no memory of who she is, where she is, or who the strange man lying next to her is. She has amnesia, and is unable to form new memories, or retain her old ones. Some mornings she wakes up thinking she is in her twenties, others she believes she is a child. Most mornings she tip-toes to the restroom, and is surprised to find a middle-aged woman staring back at her from the mirror. It is there she finds pictures of herself and others taped to the wall. The pictures have names and identities below them. All left to remind her of who she is.

Christine lives with her husband Ben who, every day, has to tell her that she lost her memory after her accident 20-some-odd years ago. One day Christine receives a phone call from a neuropsychologist who tells her he has been working with her to help her retrive her memory. He gives her a journal that she has been keeping and on the very first page the words ""DON'T TRUST BEN!"" are written in her own handwriting.

This book is a psychological thriller that will have you turning the pages well after bedtime. It is obvious in the first few pages that something isn't quite right. Should she, or shouldn't she trust her husband? A majority of the book is Christine's Journal and to say anymore would give away the details, and I don't like to give spoilers. Though it does feel the author tends to spend a little too much time drawing things out, the ending packs such a punch that it's easily forgiven.

Before I Go to Sleep,0062060554,S.J. Watson,Barnes and Noble,3.9,theReader278,I loved reading this wonderful book! It has a story that keeps you entertained for hours. Truly excellent!!
Before I Go to Sleep,0062060554,S.J. Watson,Barnes and Noble,3.9,-Madison-,"""Before I Go to Sleep"" is a brilliant and profound piece of fiction, a psychological thriller that will captivate the reader about a traumatic brain injury that when the main protagonist wakes up she can't remember anything about herself. I can't imagine too many things as frightening as that! The premise was different from anything I've read before. This is a remarkable job of taking us through Christine's mind as she learns about events and people in her past and the frustrations involved in not being able to remember. She keeps a journal, at the suggestion of Dr. Nash; the idea being that she progressively remembers her life before the accident that caused her amnesia. The first part of the book tells about her meeting her husband and her psychiatrist calling her, telling her that she needs to read the journal she has been keeping. He gives it to her and tells her to contact him if she wants to continue her treatment. What a pulse-pounding thriller! It's suspenseful throughout and the pacing is brilliant. The thriller ending is not predictable so don't bother. Profound and completely captivating, yes, but the intrigue will keep your eyes glued.

A Study in Scarlet,1420925539,Arthur Conan Doyle,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Luvsoc85,"The first of the four Sherlock Holmes novel the character development is wonderful.  You really capture the essence of Watson and Holmes.  The story starts off very intriguing with a mysterious murder and the chase of the killer.  However, there is a LONG intermission during the chase to give the back story of the killer and victims.  The back story proves useful once the case is resolved but I found it a little too long and wanted to get back to Baker Street.  As one of the classics it is a must read and a good start to the rest of the novels."

Each book in the Inheritance Cycle is better than the last! Chris Paolini is an impressive writer! When I read his books, I can't put them down! The depth of detail and his writing style provide a vivid mental image. I can read his books and it's like a watching a movie in my head. I love Eragon, and I get choked up every time Brom is mentioned. I hope he finishes that fourth book soon. It's as bad as it used to be to wait for the next Harry Potter book. And when will they make the next movie?!?"
"Brisingr (The Inheritance Cycle, #3)",0375826726,Christopher Paolini,Barnes and Noble,4.5,redheart52,Christopher Paolini does a great job at continuing the series. The ending left me wanting more and i can't wait for the next book. Paolini did a great job at making his characters grow and reveling more about the fantasy world that he created.
"Brisingr (The Inheritance Cycle, #3)",0375826726,Christopher Paolini,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"This book is by far the best book Paolini has written by far. In the year he took off and the time it has taken him to write this book he has grown so much as a writer. The evidence is plastered all over the pages which are now loaded with more detail.Brisinger was excellent and left me wanting more. The story begins with Eragon going off with his cousin Roran, to help rescue Roran's beloved, Katrina, from King Galbatorix's clutches. The story has many twists and turns when Eragon and Saphira are once again faced with opponents more powerful then themselves. The reader finally gets to know about Aya's friend/lover and the events that occurred just before Eragon found her.There will be a Major death, A BIG secret, the rise of a new dwarf King, the secret about a dragons power and the reader will get to know Eragon character and struggles like never before. With the Varden taking over city by city Galbatorix is not taking a blind eye to their presence anymore.This book is a MUST read for anyone who has read the previous Eragon books."
The Purpose Driven Life: What on Earth Am I Here for?,0310276993,Rick Warren,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"When I first read The Purpose Driven Life, I was a born-again Christian. I don't like tags but that is the best description I can give. I had attended church most of my life but drifted away. In my mid-40s, I began searching. I felt empty. When a friend recommended Warren's book, I read it, following the 40-day journey plan. I have recommended and bought copies for people. It is not the Bible but it helped me to understand many things not only about God but myself and my relationship with Him. Some may not find it enlightening but I believe that if you read it with an open mind, you will learn more about God and your relationship with Him. The book is easy to follow. I have gone through it four times. Each time I read it, I find something new to think about."
The Purpose Driven Life: What on Earth Am I Here for?,0310276993,Rick Warren,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"I read A Purpose Driven Life by Rev. Rick Warren two years ago. I came away frustrated because after nine months of struggling with the forty day program, I still didn't feel I had a purpose in life. The fault didn't lie in Rev. Warren's book; it was in my thought process.I thought the book was all about finding the perfect job. I hoped God would speak when I opened the book (like one of those musical Hallmark cards) and that He would name my perfect career. Not so. Practically speaking, career assesment tests do a much better job. God kept pretty quiet as to whether I would make a better secretary or bellhop.What I did find after reading The Purpose Driven Life was a deeper relationship with God. This relationship opened the door to understanding (eventually) what my life purpose is. I finally realized that my life's purpose is unique to me. It's not a job, per se, but a calling to do God's will.When I discerned my purpose, mission, calling - I realized that as long as I centered my work in God's will then it didn't matter if I was a cabdriver, a barista at Starbucks, a grade school librarian, or a life coach. I can (and should) serve God in my unique way at work, at home, no matter where I am."
The Purpose Driven Life: What on Earth Am I Here for?,0310276993,Rick Warren,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"Rick Warren's, 'A Purpose Driven Life,' will certainly make you ponder and reflect on the life you're leading. From the very beginning of the book, I found myself drawn into his beliefs. People often question, 'What in the world are we on this Earth for?' or 'What is our purpose?' 'Does life make sense?' Of course, no one alive knows the true answer. It is in our own belief system. Some criticize his views. However, he has a right to his own belief system. I found myself connecting with him from page one. Having gone through medical adversities in life within my family, I understand what he is trying to convey to the reader. When bad things happen to people they ask the question, 'WHY ME, WHY NOW? However, WHY NOT ME? My belief system is that God does have a master plan that we will never understand. Many people do believe that we are here for a purpose and everything happens for a reason.     I've had that experience many times in my life. The right person will enter my life to help me or a family member through a difficult adversity. Or a book will show up on the store bookshelf that will suggest the perfect solution to my problem. I believe that certain things 'good and bad' happen for a reason. Otherwise, this unpredictable world wouldn't make sense. Since I have experienced adversity 'as we all have', and have found some joy out of the difficult situations in life, I agree with Rick Warren about God's plan for us.     It gives me solace and peace knowing that God does have a plan for our lives. People think they can escape adversity. But no where in the Bible does it say that life will be all sunshine. There will surely be rainy days. It reinforced my own belief system and I highly recommend this book just to wake people up to let them know that life has meaning. We are here for a purpose. Let us not forget what our purpose is in this life.If we all acted with more compassion and acceptance, our world would be a much better place to live in.     Nancy A.

As the new leader of the Dark Daughters, she's responsible for turning it into a respectable and admirable club. Also, she seems to find herself with two boyfriends...with another guy sending her some mixed signals. On top of all of that, Zoey has been seeing some dark and mysterious creatures on the east wall. She wonders if it's all a trick of the mind, until human teenagers start disappearing...and ending up dead. Zoey will have to start facing the facts, especially after a shocking death in their midst reveals that what she has seen is no figment of her imagination...and what's truly horrifying is the identity of the person behind it all.Betrayed picks up on all the suspense and thrill right where Marked left off. Full of twists and turns that flow fluidly and a continuation of excellent character development, Betrayed reveals more sinister plots and dastardly deeds that will leave readers reeling. The many normal teenager issues and feelings are melded with the supernatural happenings to create an adventurous and believable story. Though the world in which Zoey lives is unfamiliar, the Casts make the reader right at home with their smooth and inimitable writing style."

"Storm Front (The Dresden Files, #1)",0451457811,Jim Butcher,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Piper68,"At times funny, touching, snarky, scary, and exciting, this book is a great introduction to the Dresden Files series by Jim Butcher.  Mr. Butcher has created an excellent character in Harry Dresden, who, while being in unrealistic situations, seems to have realistic reactions (for a hero, that is).  I cannot recommend this book enough to fans of fantasy and mystery, as well as the other following books in the series."
"Storm Front (The Dresden Files, #1)",0451457811,Jim Butcher,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"This book is clearly one of my favorite books!  I myself have a very difficult time getting actively engaged in books. I buy many books hoping to get captured by one of them so that I will not want to put the book down.  This book has done it!  I didn't know anything about the Dresden Files Series until the twelfth book already came out.  I read reviews on that one and it sparked some curiosity into purchasing the first book.  After reading the first few chapters, I was hooked!

The thing I love most about this book is how laid back and down to earth the main character(Harry Dresden) is.  I also enjoy finding out what this paranormal investigator will get his hands into.  Another great thing I enjoy about the book is that it takes place in Illinois, and the author provides very great detail in the surroundings in an actual location which people could picture in there own heads.

This is a great read, and I highly recommend this book!  I can't wait to purchase the next books in the series!"
"Storm Front (The Dresden Files, #1)",0451457811,Jim Butcher,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"This book, this series, is mystery done right - the key clue given in the first chapter or three, and you never see it because it's just part of the background.  I've never recommended this book to anyone who didn't enjoy it.

This book is fantasy for myth and folklore enthusiasts - it's real old-world style, with a powerful grounding in cultural heritage.  It has a real pre-Tolkien feel to its mythology.

I bought this book for my dad, who's not a big reader.  It takes him ages to read a book.  He finished it in two weeks and was eager to go to the store to get the next!

I can rarely pick up a new book in this series and not read it from start to finish in a single sitting."
Northanger Abbey,1593082649,"Jane Austen, Alfred MacAdam",Barnes and Noble,4,Anne_Scarlett,"I have been a big Jane Austen fan since I first read Pride and Prejudice as a ten year old. Since then, my love has only grown. I thought that nothing could top Pride and Prejudice, then I read Northanger Abbey. I love this book! It is funny, sweet, has good morals, endearing characters, and everything else that a good novel needs. I would recommend this to anyone who loved Pride and Prejudice or wished that Persuasion had a bit more spice. It is perfectly lovely, and a piece of work worthy of recognition. Put this in your personal library and read it again and again!"
Northanger Abbey,1593082649,"Jane Austen, Alfred MacAdam",Barnes and Noble,4,peppered_piper,"What seasoned Austen readers know is that Northanger Abbey is written almost entirely in a satirical vein. It is one of Jane Austen's finest displays of wit throughout her writing, poking fun at gothic novels and embellishing with zest. Readers who are only familiar with a few of Austen's works, like the more mainstream Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility, may thus be confused by difference in tone of Austen's first novel. It is a splendid way to familiarize oneself with all of Austen's work. Five stars."

Epic, beautiful, terrifying , dark and hopeful all at once.  I can't wait for the next one."
"The 5th Wave (The 5th Wave, #1)",0399162410,Rick Yancey,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"An epic story of trust and human survival in the wake of an alien invasion, The 5th Wave is a well written teen fantasy novel that is a page turner.  Cassie Sullivan is a strong female lead that is thrust into a deadly new world on her own.  She's seen her fair share of death and has some serious trust issues.  Not very heavy on the actual sci-fi stuff, but that doesn't matter.  Teens will be talking about this one this summer."
"The 5th Wave (The 5th Wave, #1)",0399162410,Rick Yancey,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"The story is interesting enough, I guess. It's funny: it's marketed as being like Ender's Game, The Hunger Games, and The Road, but it feels more like the author <i>wanted</i>
 to make it like those, so he sloppily threw together a girl wandering the wasteland here, a camp for child soldiers there. When the quasi-Twilight love triangle started to develop, I almost threw the book down entirely. On the other hand, it's fairly entertaining at times and a pretty easy read, and I think my disappointment was augmented by all of the hype and advance marketing the book got. 

I don't know what it is about teen books that they all start to feel the same, like they're written by the same mediocre, seventeen-year-old. Sometimes I wonder if &quot;Teen&quot; is just what publishers call books they've  already committed to publishing that aren't good enough for the adult fiction section and happen to be about people under 20. I would just lower my bar for teen books, except that I've read great books geared towards young adults, and it would be a disservice to those authors to call this one-eyed man King. 

If you're big into the Teen Adventure scene, or a fan of  Rick Yancey, by no means am I trying to dissuade you from reading. If you're a reader who likes to read a little of everything and got caught up in the hype for this book, just don't expect to have your mind blown."
Cold Mountain,0802142842,Charles Frazier,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"I literally could not put this book down once I started reading it. With the turn of each page, I found myself becoming an even more curious and eager companion on Inman's journey. The unspoken connection between Inman and Ada is one most people can only long for. Ada's transformation is equally inspiring. Never before have I so highly recommended a book to friends, and never before have I recommended a book to strangers."
Cold Mountain,0802142842,Charles Frazier,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"There is a depth and richness to Mr. Frazier's reading of his book which makes the unabridged audio version superior to the printed one. At 449 pages, and with many long passages about the characters' thoughts, emotions, and world they inhabit, reading the book can - at times - be a stretch of one's patience.     But when you listen to the book, you are transported by Mr. Frazier's voice to a world that is deep in belief, experience, and characters whose lives become part of your own. Having listened to Garrison Keillor on NPR's 'A Prairie Home Companion' for many years, I cannot help but make an overwhelmingly positive comparison when reflecting on Mr. Frazier's ability to draw you gently but unyieldingly into the triumphs and tragedies of the characters' lives as well as the spirit of the land along the Blue Ridge in the western Carolinas. Like Mr. Keilor, the author has deep roots in the territory that he describes, and there is simply no substitute for the kind of familiarity found in writers who draw well on their native surroundings.      Note #1:  Get the unabridged version of the tapes. Don't sell yourself short with the abridged. You don't really gain anything, and you'd lose a lot...      Note #2:  Women read a lot more books than men for a variety of explainable and unexplainable reasons and this book has the many elements guaranteed to attract the female audience. But I want to say this is a bonafide winner for men also, especially since the tape can become part of commuting to work. As a man, I am always wary of the way authors of historical novels can transform characters - especially men - into Jane Austen period pieces. Saps or heroes or whatever. Not true with this one. Mr. Frazier tells it straight on. It is a novel to be respected.    Note #3:  Although it is set during the Civil War, the major military events are distant and described in tragic remembrance. But the local version of the war is ever-present and intense. It's a very personal set of experiences framed by civilian life under a military rule that is mediocre, savage, and inept.     For a fine novel on a major military event of the Civil War, listen to the tape version of 'The Killer Angels', a profile of the key decision-makers (both large and small) at Gettysburg."
Cold Mountain,0802142842,Charles Frazier,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"I have written a review about this book when I first read it and I must say it really is a wonderful fiction piece. I read this novel during the junior year of highschool, and now as a Graduate Student who has a more in-depth understanding on literary works, this books still continues to hold up and remains in my top-3 books of all time. Although some casual readers may be turned off by the length of it, I suggest stick with it and you will not be disappointed."
If You Give a Mouse a Cookie,0060245867,"Laura Joffe Numeroff, Felicia Bond",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Steventas,"You will read it in the living room.  

If you read it in the living room, you will probably read it in the dining room.  

If you read it in the dining room, you will probably read it at nap time.  

And if you read it at naptime, you will probably read it at bed time.  

And chances are, if you read it at bed time, you will read it a second time. :)

Our three year old great-niece LOVES this book and the ""If you give a cat a cupcake"" book.  She pretty much picks one of the two a few times each week for us to read to her at nap and bedtime.  The pictures are great, and allow us to go ""outside"" the story and look for items, and when he is drawing - colors of crayons and counting things in the pictures and other learning activities while reading the book.  Other than that and the educational value of learning that choices come with consquences, this doesn't have much ""educational"" value - it isn't a counting book or have a deep moral story.  But, it is a very beautiful book and when our great-niece outgrows it, it will go on my art book shelf.

So, if you buy this book, chances are you will enjoy it and the little one you buy it for will also enjoy it - again, and again.

If You Give a Mouse a Cookie,0060245867,"Laura Joffe Numeroff, Felicia Bond",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"I bought this book after referring to it at work and realizing that none of my co-workers had read it.  As this was a classic from my childhood, I was a bit flabbergasted.  I shared it with them, and now have it sitting on my desk as a reminder of thinking through a scenario from end-to-end.  I'm in the software industry, and it's a simple but effective illustration of the fact that it's not just enough to give your customers a feature: you have to think about what they'll do with it when they get it.  The lessons in the book are ones adults need to be reminded of too, not just ones for kids."
If You Give a Mouse a Cookie,0060245867,"Laura Joffe Numeroff, Felicia Bond",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"Laura Joffe Numeroff and Felicia Bond have teamed up on several children's stories.                       Many people will tell you that this is their favorite in the series. I slightly prefer When You Give a                       Moose a Muffin, but you'll have to decide for yourself by reading them both.                         Having had two sons, I always found them most delightful when they were the most physically worn                       out. Oh, if only I had had this mouse to keep them occupied!                         The boy is sitting in his front yard eating a cookie. He spies a mouse, and gives the mouse a little                       bite.                          This is a forward mouse, though, and he asks if he might have a glass of milk to go with the cookie.                       The boy takes him inside and obliges. Then the mouse inquires about having a straw. The boy finds                       him one. Then the mouse requests a napkin. That means that he is concerned about having a milk                       mustache. So the mouse wants a mirror to check. While looking in the mirror, he notices that his                       whiskers need some trimming. He requests some nail scissors from the boy. Considerately, he then                       wants a broom to sweep up. But if you're going to sweep in one area, you might as well do many.                       While you're at it, the floors could use a good washing. That makes the mouse tired, so he needs a                       nap. The boy makes him a little bed out of a box and a tiny blanket and pillow. But the mouse                       cannot sleep without a story. Seeing the pictures, the mouse thinks what fun it would be to make                       some pictures. Paper and crayons must be obtained! After the picture is done, he must naturally                       have a pen to sign his name. Then, the boy has to get some Scotch tape so that the picture can go                       on the refrigerator. Then, of course, you get thirsty from all that activity. You get some milk from the                       refrigerator . . . and of course, it's a good idea to have a cookie. And off we go again!!                         The contrast between the increasingly exhausted looking boy, and the sprightly mouse make for                       much good humor. Also, the boy is better at getting things for the mouse than putting them away, so                       the house is soon filled with messy piles of what the mouse wanted . . . sort of mouse droppings as it                       were.                          The absurdity of a tiny mouse running a boy ragged is quite hilarious to youngsters. By reading the                       book faster and faster, you can add a note of semi-hysteria that increases the fun.                          The words are easy to follow, and closely track the illustrations. Children can easily begin to                       memorize the story, decode the words, fill in the blanks, and later begin to read aloud to you (first                       from memory, and later in reality).                          The book is beautifully illustrated in a semi-Dr. Seuss style by Felicia Bond that adds much to the                       enjoyment.                          One thing I like about the story is that it gets into how one thing can lead to another. That's one of                       the best ways to stimulate intelligence and imaginative thinking. It is also good for problem solving                       later in life. Now, where did all these mouse whisker shavings come from? What caused them?

"Something Blue (Darcy & Rachel, #2)",0312323867,Emily Giffin,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"I picked this book up, without even looking at the flap, because I so loved Something Borrowed. I had no clue what it was about. When I began the book and realized that the same characters were in this one, I got excited. Then I promptly got un-excited when I realized that the central first-person character of this book was Darcy -- the lying, cheating, spoiled brat ""best friend"" from Something Borrowed. I was immediately concerned that this book, being told from Darcy's perspective, would taint my fondness toward the Rachel and Dex characters from the first book, and I did not want that. It's always nice to look back fondly on characters you really like and/or identify with from a book you truly enjoy. I thought that Giffin might use this book to make you feel sympathy for spoiled Darcy and shed light on why she did the things she did. But to my surprise and delight, she did not. What's more, Darcy is still the annoying, shallow character that she was in the first book. You would think that would make for an annoying read, but it does not. Giffin pulls it off somehow and keeps it intriguing. And if ever there was a story of positive character evolution, this is it. Darcy does change over time, for the better, but not at the expense of the characters you may have grown to love. The ending of this book, too, is worth noting. Few really good books have really good endings in my opinion, but this one does. The final pages of the book are poignant, poetic ... perfect. And without being fairy tale saccharinized. 
Something Blue is a fabulous story of friendship, romance, and self-discovery. It was easy for me to give it 5 stars."
"Something Blue (Darcy & Rachel, #2)",0312323867,Emily Giffin,Barnes and Noble,4.2,theReader278,I loved reading this wonderful book! It is a story that keeps you entertained for hours.
"Something Blue (Darcy & Rachel, #2)",0312323867,Emily Giffin,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Sosweet487,"After reading Something Borrowed I LOATHED Darcy and could not understand how she got her own book. After some hesitation I decided to give it a try. I have to admit I did not love Darcy right away. She was still her spoiled, selfish, and down right annoying self. I had no compassion for her! But as the book progressed and Darcy's character progressed I began to feel for her and surprisingly ROOTING for her to get her happy ending. I actually ended up loving this book 10 times more than the first and will forever be one of my all time favorites :)

Great Job Emily Griffin for doing it again!!"

Station Eleven,0385353308,Emily St. John Mandel,Barnes and Noble,4.1,BrandieC,"There has been a lot of &quot;buzz&quot; surrounding Emily St. John Mandel's contribution to the post-apocalyptic genre, Station Eleven, which was selected as one of Amazon's best books of the month for September. While I'm not sure that all the hype is quite justified, I did enjoy Mandel's writing and her fresh approach. Rather than placing her primary focus on the horrors and challenges of survival in a world decimated by the &quot;Georgia flu,&quot; Mandel clearly believes the motto she gives her Traveling Symphony: &quot;Survival is insufficient.&quot; The main characters in Station Eleven are not ex-military hardasses, as is so often the case in this genre; they are actors, musicians, and artists who believe that the fine arts are essential to our human identity, a sentiment with which I heartily agree. Mandel conveys this feeling not only through the actions and dialogue of her characters, but also by following key relics of the pre-apocalypse world (a paperweight, a comic book) as they pass through various hands, connecting lives in sometimes unexpected ways. We have here, not six degrees of Kevin Bacon, but six degrees of &quot;Station Eleven,&quot; the comic book from which the novel draws its title.

Strangely enough, Station Eleven's strength is also its main weakness. Mandel gives short shrift to her characters' survival narratives. Survival may be insufficient, but it is nevertheless essential. Kirsten Raymonde, the child actor who subsequently joins the Traveling Symphony in its Shakespeare productions, doesn't remember her first year as a survivor, presumably because it was too traumatic. Although I didn't need the gory details, I did feel as though her amnesia left a gaping hole as I reached the end of the book.

This quibble aside, Station Eleven is a moving and surprisingly hopeful addition to the literature of the post-apocalypse.

I received a free copy of Station Eleven through Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review."

It is written is such a way that Mr. Ove becomes real in your life. The author lets you be upset with him,  feel his pain and loneliness and sadness and then lets you see his heart and then his vulnerability. This is a book that I will give as gifts at Christmas and birthdays just because it is written in such a way that it captivates you.  I couldn't put it down and I have reviewed quite a lot of books.

I particularly enjoyed the way Buck portrayed China, its class systems/struggles, and family cultures. When reading the story it was obvious Buck was very knowledgable of China and the time setting in which the story occurred. Although there were many times I had a strong dislike of the main character there were times when the reader could not help but be impressed with his resolve. The saddest moments in the book involved those dealings with his wife. We should all be very thankful not to be a laboror's wife in revolutionary China.

It's not that he's original... he borrows a lot ideas from Walter Benjamin and Claude Levi-Strauss, but that he explains it in clear, easy language, with examples.The chapter about oil painting was especially illuminating for me, as I had never understood how to tell a ""great"" oil painting from a mediocre one, having no context in which to see them.  But Berger here really dissects the historical origins of the form, and what oil really allowed artists to do that they weren't able to do before.Major turn off: the entire book is set in bold type.  I have no idea why this decision was made, but the book is worth reading, despite this huge flaw.  Another smaller flaw: a book about images should definitely have been printed in color."
"Dragonfly in Amber (Outlander, #2)",0385335970,Diana Gabaldon,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"Dragonfly in Amber is a really good second chapter of the Outlander series. If you enjoyed Outlander you are sure to enjoy the continuation of Jamie and Claire's story. All of the characters from the first novel are back, with more romance and political intrigue than ever.

At nearly a thousand pages, this book is longer than Outlander, but generally the pacing is good and the action comes fast, so you keep reading. I did feel like the third quarter of the book dragged a little bit, but all in all I really enjoyed the read.

I would not recommend that a reader new to the Outlander series start with this book, since there is very little flashback to the first book, and you really need the background of the first book to understand what is going on in Dragonfly.

For the most part, I recommend books that don't need prior books for the background check, but this was an exception."

This is the second book in the Outlander series.There is so much story in this book I honestly don't know where to begin...The story starts out in 1968, Claire Randall is a doctor, her husband Frank Randall passed away two years ago. She is traveling in Scotland with her daughter Brianna. Traveling back to Inverness where she disappeared into the past twenty years ago. She returns to visit an old friend and to try to find out the fate of her other husband Jamie Fraser and his clansmen, wondering if they died with so many others on the battlefield of Culloden in 1746.An engrossing read with lots of attention to detail, those of you who love details like I do will not be disappointed. I know that Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series is sometimes categorized as romance, I think that is an incredibly limiting label to place on a story that is so rich with history and adventure. Reading this I often found myself humming the theme to Indiana Jones. I loved the adventure, the treachery and the passionate love story between Claire and Jamie.Gabaldon creates very vivid descriptions and very realistic characters and a wonderfully rich story. She's a talented writer and a gifted story teller and I am looking forward to reading more in this series."
"Dragonfly in Amber (Outlander, #2)",0385335970,Diana Gabaldon,Barnes and Noble,4.5,ReadingQueen12-17,"I actually started this book a year ago. The fact that I am just now writing this review because I've just now finished this book is telling in and of itself. After reading Outlander and LOVING it, I set sky high expectations for the rest of the series and delved into book 2 with lightning speed. After 500 pages of this romantic onslaught (which is only the half way point), my rocket paced enthusiasm was reduced to a mere farting noise. As so often happens when I read two books by the same author back to back, the stylistic flaws become blaringly obvious and in the case of Dragonfly, Gabaldon's honeydew dialogue and purple prose proved too much for my pallet. 
To be fair, book two does pack its fair share of action, introduces a new cast of characters, and moves the landscape from the rugged highlands of Scotland to the metropolitan high life in Paris. But in spite of all this, the benefits of the story can not overcome the pitfalls of the writing. For example, after a scene where Clare and Jamie barely escape a life threatening situation by the skin of their teeth, Clare turns to Jamie and exclaims ""Oh Jamie! I just want to make love to you!"" 
What?! That doesn't even make sense! You are almost killed, you've just gotten home, it is made expressly clear that you feel like hell and you want to make love? I mean maybe ""Oh Jamie, open that whiskey I need to get drunk"" or ""Oh Jamie, let's call a therapist!"" but not ""let's make love"". That's just ridiculous. 
The other issue I have is with Gabaldon's apparent obsession with adverbs. There is not a SINGLE action that takes place without some descriptive word preceding it: ""he handsomely ran across a field"", ""she tremblingly touched his glistening chest"". OH MY GOD. 
Will I continue with the rest of the series? Yes, because I've already bought the books. Will I enjoy them? Not likely."

""Finally, I can read it on my Nook"", I thought.  I was extremely disappointed in some of the choices of the formatters.  Tolkien's illustrations are included, but are reduced to a postage stamp size, for some reason.  The Nook screen has a very high resolution, and the illustrations should take advantage of it!  The illustrations even look terrible on the tiny iPhone screen.  Also, for some reason, the lines of verse are irregularly spaced.  Sometimes you'll get 5 stanzas on the screen, sometimes two or three with bizarre spacing.  If I'm paying for a product, I expect a professional look and consistent formatting!"

Tolkien, David Wenzel, Sean Deming",Barnes and Noble,4.5,GVSreading,"The Hobbit (the prelude to the Lord of the Rings) starts out great and never goes downhill from there. When it starts out with a three foot tall person being thrown out of his home with nothing, and coming back the richest person in his country, it will almost always be a great book.
  In the beginning a hobbit named Bilbo gets thrown out of his home and goes on an adventure.  The following exert is Gandalf the wizard getting Bilbo out the door. ""But. """"No time for that!"" ""But.""""No time for that either!""   He then goes on a fantastic journey with talking spiders, goblins, greedy elves, and..riddles.  That last part may not make sense, but it will when you read it and decide it is an incredible book.
  I think it is an occasionally funny, exciting, fantasy genre adventure story.  It sprinkles in humor sparingly at good points in the story.  It is not a book I would recommend for those below eleven or twelve years of age.
 The Hobbit is, in my opinion, an incredible read that should be worth a look from everyone.
 The Hobbit is the greatest book I have ever read, and a true classic.  If you like The Lord of the Rings movies, you will love this book.  When I set it down, I was captivated by its story, and its incredible quality."
The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao,1594489580,Junot Díaz,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"After reading so many positive reviews and hearing about   the numerous awards this book won, I was extremely   anxious to get my hands on a copy.  Once I did, however,   I was disappointed.  I was expecting Diaz's style to be   much more subtle and sophisticated, based on what I'd   read in the reviews, and was rather underwhelmed by his   style of prose.  The characters had the potential to be very   interesting, but I think the author tried to delve too deeply   into too many of them, thus leaving the reader with a   shallow impression of all.  Oscar, especially, disappointed   me.  While he may not be a typical DR boy, he is the   standard nerdy American boy stereotype.  I almost felt as   if I was reading a random YA paperback with subpar   writing and a so-so plot.    I enjoyed the supernatural elements of the book, but they   were so few and far between, and examined so briefly,   that Diaz might as well just have left them out.  The   Spanish sentences and the footnotes didn't bother me.  If   I don't understand something, I can always find an   internet translation site, and while the footnotes did drag   a bit at times, my understanding of the book would have   been severely prohibited without them.    Overall, not a bad book by any means, but certainly not   one of my favorites.  Perhaps if my expectations hadn't   been so high to start with I would have enjoyed it more."

As an English teacher, I find some of the slang and strange sentence structure slightly off-putting, but certainly not enough to put the book down.  I find Latin American history/culture extremely fascinating, so the novel's take on the Trujillo Era is quite engaging.  I would recommend it to a friend, but it is neither light nor easy reading,so better for a book club/somewhat serious read than escapist or beach reading..."
The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao,1594489580,Junot Díaz,Barnes and Noble,3.9,PickledJarofBrain,"Book Review: The Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao

            The Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao by Junot Diaz is definitely not an ordinary book. and not to be read lightheartedly. It is written in lively voices of the characters in mix of English and Spanish, jumping from time to time and characters to the other. It tells the story of the De Leon Family, consisting of the Single Mother, Bel&#237;cia, and her children, Lola and Oscar. Bel&#237;cia's story tells the tale of her youth, when she was so recklessly in love with men and the disaster the love brings to her. Lola's story consists of a growing woman trying to find her freedom within her rocky relationship with her mother. Oscar, the main boy, tries to find true romance with his heavy body and geeky tastes, and ends up meeting his own ""happy"" doom. A strong curse (or 'F&#250;ku', as the family calls it) seems to follow this family from 1944~1995, and the characters struggle to survive and find their destiny within it.

            The book is not particularly an easy reading, for there are so many jumps. Time jumps almost randomly every chapter, and at this change, the narrator, place, and people flips back and forth. Also, the author provides an inside-out history of the Trujillo dictatorship in Dominican Republic in side notes, which deeply related with the story base. Violence and injustice is strong in the story, and you'll be taken back by the intensity of emotions. Despite the strong themes, there are still humor and romance (although sometimes politically wrong), and draws its readers into the true read-through oh humanness

            I recommend  The Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao to those who like a story with fast pace, and a mix of fiction with reality. Also, the book contains many aspects, from violence to humor, and is good to re-read. For those who does not like so much changes in plot from chapter to chapter, this book might not be as capturing to you.

            In overall, this book opened my eyes to a new type of literature with its direct 'street' language, talking about very possible events. I strongly recommend this book to be read smoothly and through the night, and hope that you experience the excitement in it too."
Their Eyes Were Watching God,0061120065,Zora Neale Hurston,Barnes and Noble,4.1,rb924life,"My Review
	

This review is about a book called ""Their Eyes Were Watching God,"" by Zora Neale Hurston.  If you wanted to now the genre of this book is a Western Romance type.  If you like stories about the past in slavery time you will love this book.  This book consists of many people since the setting is in the town of Eatonville in Florida.  Main characters of the book consist of Janie, Jody Starks, and a young man by the name of Tea Cake.  Supporting characters in the story are Nanny Crawford, Johnny Taylor, Pheoby Watson and Dr. Simmons.  In more depth Janie is a really complex character in this book.  She is beautiful, very intelligent, and powerful.  Throughout this whole story she tries to find who and what she really is and fights through all of the obstacles and finds out that she is a powerful black women that doesn't need a man to support her.  Another main character in this book is young sweet talking Tea Cake who is Janie's longest lover.  Tea Cake plays a huge roll in this story.  He teaches Janie many things and plays a crucial role in her development.  He is a strong well rounded character with only great morals.  This guy is the best guy out of the other two, first husband Logan Killicks and Jody Starks her second husband.  In this story the setting is really significant because it is based in Florida a little bit after slavery has been abolished.  Because of this there are many African-Americans who are just like Janie and Tea Cake trying to find a home and where they fit in life.  The major conflict for the most part is that Janie can not stay with a man for her entire life and trying to figure out ultimately who she is.  During the course of this story she is with three different guys.  She leaves two of them and something happens to the other that I won't exactly tell what.  One thing that is very special about this book is the dialect between characters.  Throughout the whole story the characters don't speak proper english, they still have a sense of not being educated when they speak, but it sort of gives the book a good aspect and makes it more realistic.  In this book there is a lot of conversations and dialect it's the majority of the book.  You don't tend to get inside to the thoughts of characters.  The point of view in this book is first person told from Janie's views.  I'm a high school baseball player type of guy and I really honestly could say that I was pretty interested in this book.  Even though it wouldn't be a book I regularly read.  It took me for a ride through the life of Janie from childhood growing up to her late forties.  There were thrills and excitement to starting a new town of only colored folks to disappointment and tragedy at the end of the book.  All in all it was a thumbs up.  A great read!!!!!"
Their Eyes Were Watching God,0061120065,Zora Neale Hurston,Barnes and Noble,4.1,FayBellamyPowell,"I first read ""Their Eyes Were Watching God"" more than 45 years ago and thought it was a magnificent piece of writing.  In August of 2008 I  bought the book on CD, read by Ruby Dee, and I must tell you, I was overwhelmed. Ruby makes the characters in this book live.  If there was such a thing as Oscars for individuals reading books on tape/CD etc., Ruby would win it, hands down.  Her presentation breathes life into each and every character; their voices, male and female, through her interpretation, is absolutely outstanding.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to go on an adventure, because Zora Neale Hurston's main characters were living a life of adventure, of being nomads in America, of taking a chance on life, of walking out on faith.  Amd Ruby Dee, through her vocalization, includes you in that adventure. Absolutely wonderful book and Rudy Dee's reading is like icing on the cake.  Just amazing."
Their Eyes Were Watching God,0061120065,Zora Neale Hurston,Barnes and Noble,4.1,KATiEJB,"""Their Eyes Were Watching God"" tells the story of a young black womans life. Throughout the book, she encounters many new and unpredictable obstacles that, in the end, she learns made her into a better person and more appreciative of her own life. Through three marriages, Janie learns how beautiful, though sometimes brutal, the world can be. She travels from place to place, seemingly always looking for something better, she wasn't going to settle for just anything. Janie wins the heart of any reader because of her determinaton and strong will."

Fanny's sweet character and manners touched me, and to meet all of the characters and travel along with them in time is a very touching experience, which makes you miss them when you've finished the book, as if you'd let go of old friends. I recommend this book to anyone who likes Jane Austen, or who wants a comfy read."

Man's Search for Meaning,080701429X,Viktor E. Frankl,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"I continue to look for books to read that give meaning to my life.  I was overwhelmed with the positive reviews for this book so i chose to read it.  I wasnt disappointed as i read through it in less than a day.  It touches on his experience through a concentration camp and describes a great deal into logotherapy...or finding one's reason to live.  In a time when it seems all of our immediate needs are met, i too, feel a sense of hopelessness or meaningless as i am unemployed with a mountain of student loan debt.  This book certainly shifted my focus on the outlook i have on life and definitely lived up to the reviews.  I Recommend it!"
Man's Search for Meaning,080701429X,Viktor E. Frankl,Barnes and Noble,4.2,younity521,"Through his Holocaust tale of incredible strength and courage, Frankl forces you to take a look at your own life and implement some powerful changes. Frankl's life story proves that, no matter what happens to you in your life, you can always choose to focus on the positive and move forward in the direction of your hopes and dreams."
Man's Search for Meaning,080701429X,Viktor E. Frankl,Barnes and Noble,4.2,jrsedivy,"I had received ""Man's Search For Meaning"" a couple of years ago as a gift. Since that time it had languished on my bookshelf, overcome by other priorities. After all, it was written in 1959, so it could wait a bit longer, right? Having just finished this book I really wish I would have made the time earlier. The lessons within could have easily been applied earlier and with great results. This book is simply remarkable. At 165 pages, ""Man's Search For Meaning"" is lightweight compared to some of my other reads, but this book took me some time to read, not because the subject matter was difficult, but because it really caused me to stop and reflect many a time. Great things really do come in small packages - less is more. ""Man's Search For Meaning"" is a life changing book that you simply cannot afford to pass up."
"In the Woods (Dublin Murder Squad, #1)",0670038601,Tana French,Barnes and Noble,3.6,SkatesNYC,"I have to agree with many reviews posted.  The book was overly descriptive about irrelevant details, whereas one of the biggest mysteries was never resolved (perhaps a sequel).  The back story was just a red herring for the main event it seems, and was poorly intertwined.  The fact that the ending wasn't a ""happy"" one made for an interesting read.  I found myself liking the main character all the way through until the end, where the arguments between him and the female main character were borderline ridiculous.  Could have been written better.  All in all, interesting concept, and may be next time, less time should be spend on description of nature as oppossed to actually addressing the story.  I can usually get through such a book in 2 days, this took nearly a month."
"In the Woods (Dublin Murder Squad, #1)",0670038601,Tana French,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Guest,"The first part of the book is what draws one in.  Then the investigation pretty much goes nowhere, or in circles.  There is an old mystery and a new one and both seem to be related.  The old, and more intersting one, is never really solved.  The new one is solved almost like an aside.  I came to dislike the self-centered, whining protagonist and felt badly for his partners.  I would not recommend this book as a good read."
"In the Woods (Dublin Murder Squad, #1)",0670038601,Tana French,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Anonymous,This was a very good book that kept your interest throughout.  The only criticism I have is that there were some issues that seemed paramount to the story that were never resolved.  I hate when authors do that!
The God Delusion,0618680004,Richard Dawkins,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"I am amazed at some of the negative reviews of this book and am doubtful that some of these reviewers actually read the book.  I found The God Delusion to be a well-assembled and witty argument against faith.  For the reviewers that throw scriptures at him as rebuttal, you might as well threaten him with unicorn attacks, as they hold as much weight--none!  This book will not convince those blinded by faith to open their eyes but it reinforces the convictions of those that still hold onto reason.  Richard Dawkins does a great job of showing how faith requires the believer to suspend their reason.  The fact that so many are willing to do this is troubling and downright scary.  I particularly enjoyed his dismantling of the 'uncaused first cause' argument.  I was raised as a Catholic and always asked 'Who created God?'  I never did get a satisfactory answer, only 'God always existed.'  Well, the fact that the universe always existed is more likely because it doesn't rely on some 'bearded sky daddy' that hears your thoughts and answers your prayers, just physics we don't yet understand. Too many of us have been brainwashed as children to believe in fairy tales. Thankfully, some of us recover the reason needed to see how foolish we were.  I have read most of the books that the negative reviewers recommend and would put Dawkin's book against all of them.  Logic always wins over blind faith!"
The God Delusion,0618680004,Richard Dawkins,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"I found this book very refreshing, and a great read. Although it may be considered condescending at times, he gets his point heard in an intelligent and even humorous way. As a born and raised atheist I did not need anymore convincing, but I definitely enjoyed the read. Anyone bashing this book because of their own personal beliefs should really just step back and take another look. If you don't agree with it, read it again. Maybe you'll catch it this time around. A great read for all open-minded intellectuals."
The God Delusion,0618680004,Richard Dawkins,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"Before this book, I knew that I didn't believe in ""God"" or anything of the sort. I knew what a person like myself was called before I read this book, but afterward I understood more about it afterward. I've learned a lot from this book and I recommend it to all, atheists especially who need solid ground to stand upon."
"Where She Went (If I Stay, #2)",0525422943,Gayle Forman,Barnes and Noble,4.5,BooksWithBite,"I cried. My heart broke and came back together again. I loved reading every single word of this book. There is so much emotions and unspoken regrets that punches you in the stomach.  The story is captivating from the very beginning, never letting you go. 
 
Adam and Mia are both great characters with much  history and love. The story was great as it was being told from Adam's point of view. I loved getting inside his heart and his head. I loved watching Mia as she is now. So much has happened in the past few years that to be able to see it all come together was genius.

What else can I say that hasn't already been said? This book is simply divine all the way through. If you have not picked up this book you should. It will break you heart like no other book has before, but if will also leave you smiling.

Ms. Forman wrote an unforgettable, undeniably, perfect book. It was perfect. The writing, the plot, and both amazing characters had my eyes running with tears and a heart yearning for love.

There was some minor cursing  and a sex scene (vague)."
"Where She Went (If I Stay, #2)",0525422943,Gayle Forman,Barnes and Noble,4.5,A_Readers_Record,"Writing this review is even harder then writing the review for If I Stay, which took me over a month to write.

Rather then picking up directly where If I Stay left off, Where She Went picks up three years later and this time it is Adam who guides us from his spot in stardom with his band, Shooting Star.  Adam was almost unrecognizable at first but that laid the wood work for the emotional roller coaster that was this not-even-sad book.  I mean, really, how does one cry when the book isn't really that sad.  

Who knew the stepping stones for Where She Went were not only Mia's accident and Adam and Mia's mutual love for music, even if from different spectrums, but Adam's promise,
""If you stay, I'll do whatever you want. I'll quit the band; go with you to New York. But if you need me to go away, I'll do that too. .. And that would suck, but I'll do it. I can lose you like that, if I don't lose you today. I'll let you go. If you stay."" 

At the risk of sounding extremely vague Mia's character was nothing compared to the complexity of Adam's.  The weight of his voice, his emotions, and the way that one promise paved the path for what was his life, all contributed to this extremely raw and emotional read.  Even being from Adam's point-of-view, through his eyes I was still able to see the emotions of others, for as off track as Adam was painted in his story I was still able to pick through his eyes and piece together the emotions that mattered.

Gayle Forman truly is brilliant with If I Stay and now Where She Went.  She give us two books that formed one extremely moving, thorough, story.  With having had both Mia and Adam's points of views I was able to see all sides of these characters, piecing together the story of their lives and the weight of their love and how it affected them.  Gayle concluded Where She Went beautifully, as well as the story of Mia and Adam.  Even if it wasn't straight out of a fairy tale.

And I knew right then that I would read the whole series.  Since then,  I've read about 6 of them and Killing Floor was First Rate.   All of them are Top Notch,,,hands down.  My only fear is that I'll read them all and there will be no more; will be a sad day indeed."
"Killing Floor (Jack Reacher, #1)",0515141429,Lee Child,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"This is my 1st Jack Reacher book and it won't be my last.  I am starting with the first one and have already picked up the next two books in the series.  This book was a roller coaster ride from the beginning.  Reacher gets off a bus and stumbles into a small town looking for information on a musician that lived there years ago. Next thing you know he is in a diner eating when the local police storm in and arrest Reacher for murder.  Child develops good characters, a great story, and plenty of twist. A mystery thriller that was hard to put down.  Reacher is bad ""a"" in this story and I can't wait t0o read about his next encounter with trouble."
"Killing Floor (Jack Reacher, #1)",0515141429,Lee Child,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Susan Conlan,"Having read every Reacher novel and finally beginning to get a handle on the guy after the latest, which delves into his child-of-a-military-man upbringing, and in which Reacher is ironically placed in the position of leadership in his own family, I decided to go back to the beginning and read them again, sequentially.  It is going to be fun watching Reacher grow, along with Childs' skills, and now I can appreciate the poor guy's idiocyncracies in the later stories by knowing his earlier life in the order it took place. I get a kick out of Childs' obvious affection for his character, Reacher.   It is almost as if he is raising a son, the way he explains (and makes excuses for) Reacher's unusual behavior and uncommon lifestyle.  Although I am not usually a fan of the macho or ""superhero"" persona, Childs has me returning time after time and looking for the next book.  He has made me care about his paper character like a (dare I say it)  mother!  This first book of the series is a ""must"" read for anyone intending to follow the series, in order to get a good basis for Reacher's somewhat odd lifestyle.  I appreciate Childs' imaginative and descriptive style throughout the series.  The fun begins here with this book - don't miss it."
Robinson Crusoe,0375757325,"Daniel Defoe, Gerald McCann, Virginia Woolf",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"Robinson Crusoe was an excellent read.  Entertaining and   eductional.  I used it as a read-aloud to my kids.  They   were a little skiddish at the graphic depiction of the   cannibalization (who could blame them), but they   thoroughly   enjoyed the book.    The introduction in the B&N Classics Series is worth a read   too.  It gives interesting insight into Defoe's life and   motivation for writing the novel.  The endnotes are   essentially nonexistent, which is too bad.  The B&N   Classics often (but not always) have very good endnotes to   better describe what the author was intending to convey.    Not in this book."

I was supposed to read this in school but I never took the time to do so.  Now in my late 30's I decided to read it on my nook.  I was surprised to find that this book is more about self discovery and how Crusoe discovers where he fits into God's plan.  Key ideas involved in the book are of mastery, spirituality, & morality.  Crusoe becomes a man one can truly respect."
The Prince,0937832383,"Niccolò Machiavelli, Adolph Caso, Rufus Goodwin, Benjamin Martinez",Barnes and Noble,3.3,jkepler on LibraryThing,I can see how it had a huge influence in humanistic politics--it lends itself to realpolitik.
The Prince,0937832383,"Niccolò Machiavelli, Adolph Caso, Rufus Goodwin, Benjamin Martinez",Barnes and Noble,3.3,homeofharris on LibraryThing,"Everyone relates this book as explaining how to be an unethical (possibly immoral) self-centered person to attain success by back-stabbing and the like. It gives tips on how to play people against one another, etc.I must say that honestly it is really just common sense stuff. Obviously these are all undesirable traits to find in someone, and in fact I avoid people who live their lives with any resemblance to the methods in the book, but none of this is new.  Basically it is all just politics as usual.  Watch a group of how teenage girls interact with one another, ostracize a friend for a while, steal each other's boyfriends, etc.  You'll learn everything you need to know about The Prince."
The Prince,0937832383,"Niccolò Machiavelli, Adolph Caso, Rufus Goodwin, Benjamin Martinez",Barnes and Noble,3.3,Kade on LibraryThing,"To many autodidacts, this book is a bible of political science, a gross misconception that reinforces the cynical view of politics perpetuated in popular culture.  This wouldn't bother me if it weren't for the fact that people read the Prince, and then think there's no other bibles to political science. The Prince is to modern political theory what Sun Tzu is to Clausewitz's Von Krieg.  It has come before, and is useful for tracing a linear path and building upon what comes before, but if you're a complete neophyte to political science and think this comes packed with all the answers, you're grossly off the mark, and your time would better be spent on John Locke's Second Treatise (which actually is a lighter read), Hobbes' Leviathan, Marx's First and Third Manuscripts, Burke's Reflections, or Rosseau's Social Contract.  Highly recommended for political scientists to see the origin of their discipline."
"The Amber Spyglass (His Dark Materials, #3)",0440238153,Philip Pullman,Barnes and Noble,4.4,JayInBloom,"This book is the third in the series 'His Dark Materials' by Philip Pullman. So much controversy has surrounded this book, and this is why. In 'The Amber Spyglass', Lyra and Will, the heroine and hero of the story, learn about growing up, Dust finally settling, having their daemons (spirit in animal form) find their permanent form, love, and the existence of God. now Pullman was a devout atheist when he was alive, so it shouldn't have been shocking what he said in his books about God and His angels, but many people thought it was. This book was ahead of its time, and although considered a 'children's' or 'young adults' book, it is just as easily adult literature. In his metaphorical ways, Pullman discusses the possibility of other worlds, evolution of these worlds, a young teenager's blooming sexuality, how politics AND religion can corrupt people's individual thinking, and how the interconnections between worlds,  and the organisms in them can bring not just one species or world, but everything, falling down around our heads.
One of the main issues in this book was the way God, or the 'Authority' was described, not as an all-powerful being, but simply an archangel, dying of old age, and how the hapless Lyra, and her friend Will, only being thirteen or fourteen, don't realize that by setting the Authority free of His prison, they have killed Him. You see, only the Angels and witches of Lyra's world have free access to all of the adjoining worlds in the universe, and Will carries a knife (see The Subtle Knife, Book Two of His Dark Materials) that can rip holes from one world to another. And Lyra carries an alethiometer, or a golden compass (see The Golden Compass, Book One of His Dark Materials) that can answer any question asked of it. 
After Lyra and her daemon, Pan, are kidnapped by Lyra's evil, theologian mother, Mrs. Coulter, Will and the polar bear king Iorek have to rescue her, as Lyra represents the rebirth of Eve, 'the temptress'. Also, Lyra's father, a scientist, is after her, to protect her from the Church, who believe they have to kill her, to stop the replay of the Fall from Grace described in the Book of Genesis in the Holy Bible. Will tears a whole in another world, where he and Lyra escape to, and they find themselves in the world of the dead, trying to find a way out, so the dead can be free to evaporate into the air.
The Amber Spyglass is not a book to read simply for leisure, for once you read it once, you will find yourself going back to pet its spine maybe a year afterwards, to open it to a favorite spot, and discover new meanings behind every metaphorical phrase in the book. It is a thing to mull over, and smile at your new discoveries.
One part that describes both evolution at its highest and Pullman's great ability to imagine things outside of our world, is the world in which no humans exist, but a certain Dr. Mary Malone stumbles upon, and discovers a completely, previously unheard of intelligent being, the mulefa. Their world evolved in a completely different way than out own, and theirs ties into both Mary's and Will's, and Lyra's worlds, in the way of Dust, or the beginning of the original Fall.
It may seem like a lot of information, but Pullman's writing pull you in from the first page and you are stuck until you hear Lyra's last words, 'Build the Republic of Heaven',  and the book spits you out, jumbled and ready to try and find the next in the series, but of course, as in all great endings, there is n"
"The Amber Spyglass (His Dark Materials, #3)",0440238153,Philip Pullman,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Ludolove,"I really enjoyed reading this series, but I thought the Amber Spyglass was not as good as the first two.  I would have liked it more if one of the main characters were the narrators of the book. I felt like I needed a deeper understanding of their emotions, or something that gave the characters a greater depth.  All and all, I still would definitely still recommend this series to all the fantasy lovers out there.  This story has fantastical worlds and imaginative characters."
"The Amber Spyglass (His Dark Materials, #3)",0440238153,Philip Pullman,Barnes and Noble,4.4,A-Wood,"Is a very good ending to a very good sci-fi trilogy.

"Wizard's First Rule (Sword of Truth, #1)",0765346524,Terry Goodkind,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Ravenclaww,"That is if they don't read this novel. I must admit that I first got into this because of the show Legend of the Seeker. Which got me hooked on from the very first second of the opening. As the show progressed I found out that it was based on novels and I quickly searched for them and added them to my list of books to buy. I finally bought all of the books and finished Wizard's First Rule and Holy Mother Confessor it is one of the best books I have ever read in my life. Each character is so unique but so connected to each other that you would think they were real people. The way they are written and how they interact and how they react to each other, everything just makes them believable. I feel as if I know them in real life. But it's not only the characters that are just WOW! It's the plot, the story, the lands. EVERYTHING! I don't want to give anything away, but watching the show I kind of knew how things ended. I mean, I know that the show and the books are totally different but I knew what happened to the characters. But at times when they were in danger I still held my breath and grew worried that they would be gone. Not only from the novel but from my life. Terry Goodkind is an amazing writer who created an amazing world full of loveable characters. This is one book I say you HAVE to read. That is if you want to know what great literature is. I did find a few grammar mistakes and such but they were very minor like a letter missing or a word was repeated. But put that aside, and you have a masterpeice in your hands. I will definatly have to re-read this book again in the very near future. Watch the show and read the books."
"Wizard's First Rule (Sword of Truth, #1)",0765346524,Terry Goodkind,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Dragonsinger,"Let me begin by saying I'm not a professional critic.  I loved this book as I loved the television series it spawned - ""Legend of the Seeker"".  It's full of action, romance and is packed with lessons that the right thing to do is not always easy.  If you are looking for a ""feel good"" book with a little fantasy action and romance you'll enjoy reading ""Wizard's First Rule"""

The Kitchen House,1439153663,Kathleen Grissom,Barnes and Noble,4.3,readtillyoudrop,"I purchased this book Friday night on my way home from work. I am usually a chapter a night reader; I started The Kitchen House Friday at midnight and read till 4:30am: 
I was awake at 8:30 and finish it. 

Grissom's writing creates such a colorful picture that you find yourself transported back in time. The characters are not just on the page, but are with you in such a way that you experience what they are experiencing. This is not a book that you merely read and put down, it stays with you. Papa George, Mama May, Belle and the host of other inhabitants of Tall Oaks pull you into their world and keep you hooked till the end. 

Though I normally don't read historical fiction I was brought in by it's haunting cover and after reading the prologue I couldn't put it down. I LOVED this book!"
The Kitchen House,1439153663,Kathleen Grissom,Barnes and Noble,4.3,retromom,"This story starts out with the prologue narrated by Lavinia. It depicts a horrible scene of a hanging. We know something bad has happened but we don't know why or to whom. The story then begins with Lavinia and Belle narrating alternating chapters. Lavinia is the young Irish girl who is orphaned on her family's journey to America and is taken in as an indentured servant by the ship's captain. Belle is a slave on the captain's plantation who also happens to be the daughter of the captain. Lavinia is sent to the kitchen house to be taken care of until the time that she can be of service. Lavinia becomes part of the family of Mama Mae, Papa George, Beattie, Fanny and Belle. The captain's family is pretty dysfunctional and plays a huge role in the lives of Lavinia and Belle. Lavinia eventually finds herself torn between two families and places in society. I like how the chapters alternate between Lavinia and Belle. The story flows beautifully between the two narrators. There is a lot going on in this book and I don't want to give the story line away. I think it is a story you have to experience and be surprised by. Trust me! It is a great story! There are times the story gets uncomfortable which makes it much more realistic feel than other books about the antebellum period. I could actually feel the fear of the characters at times. Once you get involved in the story of Lavinia and Belle you will not want to put this book down. I enjoyed this book very much and I highly recommend it. Don't read it too fast. You don't want to miss one morsel of this book. Kathleen Grissom does a fantastic job telling the story of The Kitchen House. I can't wait to read what she comes up with next!"

Franny and Zooey,0316769029,J.D. Salinger,Barnes and Noble,4.1,ArdentReader,"Most people know J.D. Salinger and have read ""Catcher in the Rye,"" but ""Franny and Zooey"" is a true gem. This is a small book about family and religious beliefs. This book will make you laugh out loud and cry. It is witty, funny and sad. If you want to see another side of J.D. Salinger, read this. I've read it a few times over the years and always find it new and enjoyable. 

Franny comes home a changed woman, and it is discovered that she's had a breakdown. She has begun reciting the Lords Prayer over and over much to the dismay of her intellectual family. The way her parents and brother Zooey deal with this is amusing and touching. If you love a classic than this is one to read. Forget about ""Catcher in the Rye,"" try this book that will touch your heart and your mind! After this you'll see J.D. Salinger in a whole new light."
Franny and Zooey,0316769029,J.D. Salinger,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"I absolutely hated Catcher in the Rye, thus was somewhat apprehensive about reading this work of Salinger. However, a freind continued to assure me I would love it, and once I picked it up, I actually did. It does have that slight hint of whining that Holden did in Catcher but otherwise, this actually has a story line and a plot and a reason for being. It's touching and makes you think and gave me a little slice of compassion. Though I will admit, you have to be in a certain mood in order to read this. Do not come looking for a happy-go-lucky, marvellous adventure, but rather a healing bit of insight for those weary with life."

Choke,0385720920,Chuck Palahniuk,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Middle_of_Nowhere,"This was the first book I have ever read by Chuck Palahniuk and I have to say I will never forget it. Sometime last year a friend gave me a list of books, one of the books happen to be Choke. She told me that the book was by the same guy who wrote Fight Club. I never new the movie Fight Club was based off a book and I thought because I enjoyed the movie so much I would give Choke a try. I found that this book was nothing like I have ever read before. It was so disgustingly enjoyable, I found myself lost in a world that I did not want to enter. Taboo isn't the right word, but it's the first word that comes to mind. After I finished reading this book, I could not figure out if I really liked it or not. The book had a refreshing originality to it, but I was not sure I would want to read it again. I continued to think about the book for the next following days, then it hit me: its not whether or not I like the book, it is that fact that I am still thinking about it. I think this is what Palahniuk was truly going for, he didn't care whether people liked it or not it was that people were thinking about his book. I still think about this book today and I am still not sure whether i really like it or not. However this is what makes it wonderful, I love not being able to explain things and define them. I have decided that this is one of my favorite books not because I like or don't like it but because I can't decide."

Choke,0385720920,Chuck Palahniuk,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Prahni,"From the very beginning of the novel Choke, by Chuck Palahniuk, we are instantly warned, ""If you're going to read this, don't bother."" This warning should be discarded immediately for this book was great. The main character, Victor Mancini, a med school drop-out, is a character that you really shouldn't like, but you do. You really can't help it! His perception on life is one to really think on, and by the end of the book you don't really want to leave his twisted world.
Palahniuk's  diction is simple and easy to understand, yet, the way he strings them together, create a picture unlike any other. Palahniuk certainly has a way of  reaching into our minds, disturbing us and all the while making his readers beg for more."

It was like i was really there with the characters and everything. It made me feel like i just couldn't stop reading(which for me is unusual)it.

The Green Mile,0451933028,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.7,BAMBAM808,"Stephen King, the famous artist of spook tales and horror books probably created his best novel yet! The Green Mile, an interesting story like no other, talks about Paul Edgecomb and his life at the Louisiana State Penitentiary, it dates long back to the times of racism and Death Row. He has worked there all his life, but never before had been in a situation in where he has to choose between his job, the law, and possibly his life and doing whats right. This is definitely a book for you if you like a suspenseful book! Don't mind the number of pages! I definitely recommend this book for all you people who like a book about moral, justice, segregation, and a little twist at the end! Stephen King uses his fantastic, horrific ideas and blends it with a realistic conflict that keeps you on your toes. I couldn't put the book down! During my free time, I read page after page after page! Honestly, I was never a reader to begin with! But, this book changed my perspective of reading! After reading this novel I craved for more of Stephen King's fantastic books. I now am convinced that King is one of the best authors, his way of style, his lessons, and his use of imagery (especially the execution of Delacroix, or the scene with Melinda Moores), Stephen King truly brings his art to life! I believe everyone should take some time out of their busy life to read this book. I give Stephen King a hand for another successful novel."
The Green Mile,0451933028,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.7,seaniniowa,"After watching the movie several times, I finally got around to reading the book.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel.  While not tracking entirely with the movie, it tells the exact same story and then some.  If you are a fan of the movie, you need to read the book."
The Green Mile,0451933028,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Anonymous,"This book, The Green Mile by Stephen King, shocked me.  As a ninth grader who does not get around to recreational reading, I was absolutely surprised how engaging this book was.  I have never read a book that grabbed my attention like this one has.  The first thing that I noticed about the book was the the author's name, Stephen King, which I have seen all over television commercials that are advertising a new T.V series or something.  So I thought I would give this book a try.  I am so happy that I did, Stephen King's ability to put such emotion in a book is outstanding.  The description is so precise.  He easily paints every scene that he describes in my head.  You might be thinking that you probably won't like it, because you are not a reader.  Well I'm like that, someone who finds it almost impossible to read a book that is uninteresting.  But, this book is completely worth all the long hours you put in.  I was completely drawn to this book.  It provided me with a completely new look upon reading books, I have never actually wanted to keep on reading like this before.  I strongly urge people to pick up a copy of this book.

    I loved the description used in every page.  Stephen King can take such a minor detail and dilate it into something much more.  Beside the amazing emotion and description, I loved the character John Coffey.  He is a tall, broad African American who seems very mysterious in the beginning of the book.  However, I like to compare him to a modernized, human form of God.  He takes in all the bad of the world and only tries to release good and peace.  He must have looked quite intimidating at first because he towers over the guards and is so thick.  However, John does not try to cause any trouble, he remains calm.  John Coffey was a great contribution to why I adore this book.  Along with the characters, emotion, and description; I liked the perspective that Stephen King used.  The way that the book is written in one of the guard's perspective is momentous.  If it was written in John's perspective, then it wouldn't give the book as much suspense.  The guard's perspective gave the ability to give a great description on what John looks like.

    Overall, this book is worth the time that you put in to read it.  You can take many values that the book touches upon.  I strongly urge you to take the time to find this book and let your mind get lost in the pure beauty of the book."
The Prophet,000100039X,Kahlil Gibran,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Guest,"I remember I had to read this book in high school.  I was 16, and quite frankly, hanging out with my friends and partying were much more fun than some silly homework assignment.  Fast forward 19 years.  I was in B&N a few weeks ago, and I happened to have stumbled on the book.  I wanted  something to read, so I thought, 'Eh, why not?  It looks like a quick read.' So, I bought it. Well, all I can say is, 'Wow! What a disservice I did to myself back then by not reading this book!'  Then again, maybe I wasn't prepared for such an awesome piece of work.  I think you need to experience life to really appreciate this book.  My first time reading it, I was BLOWN AWAY.  I actually started crying in a few areas of the book because I could relate so much of it to my own life and experiences.  The first time, I read it as a novel.  Now, I use it as a reference tool for life.  When my son rebels, I turn to the 'Parenting' section.  When my heart was broken earlier this year, I went to the 'Love' section.  Sometimes, my intensity is too much for daily life, so that's when I flip to the 'Reason vs Passion' section.  I have read a lot of books in my time, but I must say that this is probably the most SPECIAL book I have ever had or read.  Now, I'm not some super-intellectual who dwells in the World of the Intelligencia.  I'm just a regular person who really needed a book like this in her life.  Honestly, I think Mr. Gibran wrote this book for people like me. Heck, I was thinking that he wrote it JUST for me :-)  Enjoy."
The Prophet,000100039X,Kahlil Gibran,Barnes and Noble,4.7,E-Bennet,"When I picked this up, I had no idea what to expect. My mouth stands open. I feel like I've read a map to the entryway of my soul. I keep going back and reading my favorite parts over and over. I am in love with these words. They come off the page in my own voice, like they speak from somewhere I have been already, remember acutely. Gibran himself is a prophet, only a prophet could speak such true words. I want to quote him here to give you a taste, here the prophet is speaking of love:

""For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning.

Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun,

So shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth.

Like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto himself.

He threshes you to make you naked.

He sifts you to free you from your husks

He grinds you to whiteness.

He kneads you until you are pliant;

And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you may become sacred bread for God's sacred feast.

...

But if in your fear you would seek only love's peace and love's pleasure,

Then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of love's threshing-floor,

Into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, and weep, but not all of your tears.""

-Kahlil Gibran"

"Maus I: A Survivor's Tale: My Father Bleeds History (Maus, #1)",0394541553,Art Spiegelman,Barnes and Noble,4.4,KatieSpears on LibraryThing,"Maus I: A Survivor's Tale is a graphic novel by Art Spiegelman depicting his father's survival of the Holocaust.  This book is a biography even if it is a graphic novel becasue Spiegelman is telling his father's life story as it happened.  This book was written in 1973, but the majority of the action takes place during the flashbacks to the 1930's and 1940's during World War II and the events leading up to it.  In this book, the Jews are portrayed as mice, the Nazi's are portrayed as cats, and the Poles are portrayed as pigs.  Even with the people as animals, the story is still very human and real.This novel is about Art Spiegelman's father, Vladek, and how he survived the Holocaust.  The story begins with Art coming to his father and saying he wants to write a graphic novel about his life during World War II.  Vladek agrees, and Art continues to visit and record Vladek's tale.  Vladek begins his story with how he managed to marry Anja his first wife.  Vladek relates his story of how he had to fight in the war to keep the Germans out, and from there his experiences go down hill.  He returns home to find it has been transformed into a world ruled by the Nazi's.  From that point, life is about being smart in business and being smart in trusting people.  He has to hide with his family in bunkers he made.  Eventually, they are found out, but by that point, Vladek and Anja's family has dwindled down to only a few members.  The remaining family members get split up, and Vladek and Anja go into hiding and try to escape to Hungary.  The end of the novel is about their experiences in trying to be safely smuggled across the border to Hungary.This book is amazing.  It is so interesting that basically a cartoon strip with animals as people can tell such a moving story.  I think because the people are animals is what makes this tale so memorable.  The subject matter is, of course, very interesting, but the way Art Spiegelman doesn't leave anything our or sugar coat his dad's ornery behavior while telling the story is what engaged me as a reader.  It was very truthful even when the truth didn't show Vladek in a positive light, and I appreciated that Spiegelman kept it true to form.  This book raises the issue of the controversies of the Holocaust.  I think Spiegelman's opinion is that the Holocaust was horrific, but he feels it's his job to tell a true story so that younger generations can learn from history.  I agree with Spiegelman.  Had my family survived the Holocaust, I would feel obligated to raise awareness on such issues.  I think this book is extremely similar to Night by Elie Wiesel.  Night is a biography/fiction novel about Wiesel's own survival of the Holocaust.  Even though the story is about Wiesel's personal experiences, the book is still considered a fiction novel.  However, Night is brutally truthfull as well and show the horrors of the Holocaust in few words used in an effective way.  I think this book raises the issue of modern genocides that should be made known and stopped.  I feel more passionate now that awareness is a big step in actions against hate.Teaching ideas:-Watch Schindler's List, The Pianist, or The Devil's Arithmatic-Group project on modern genocide-Explore the meaning of mice, cats, and pigs as the people in the novelMaus is a moving graphic novel that keeps the emotion of such a powerful story very real.  The way this serious topic is presented is still respectful and tasteful because it is to inform not to ridicule.  The book's issues of hate and the Holocaust stir a need for action today against modern genocide.  Maus's main point is of survival and love that can survive anything.  I think this book would be a great book to read in the classroom because it is a difficult subject matter in an interesting a new way and because the story is so real and moving."
"Maus I: A Survivor's Tale: My Father Bleeds History (Maus, #1)",0394541553,Art Spiegelman,Barnes and Noble,4.4,amygatt on LibraryThing,"This was the first graphic novel I ever read, and I really liked it.  The Holocaust is very difficult to write about, and writing about it in this visual medium made this story even more powerful.  The fact that Art Spiegelman kept his voice very strong throughout this text really enhanced it, because the story is so close to him - it is about his own family's struggle in the Holocaust.  I read this book in college, but I might recommend this book even to a reader in late middle school, especially as they study the Holocaust in school.  This book brings readers closer than ever to this difficult period in history and helps them to see that family members of those who survived the Holocaust still suffer because of it.  Incorporating this text into a unit on the Holocaust would help students to relate to this subject on a more personal level."
"Maus I: A Survivor's Tale: My Father Bleeds History (Maus, #1)",0394541553,Art Spiegelman,Barnes and Noble,4.4,kikione on LibraryThing,"Artie goes to visit his father to find out more about his experiences during World War II and the holocaust.  He wants to write a graphic novel about his life.  This tale about his father is at times brutally honest and painful to read.  Artie has issues with his father, but has great sympathy for what he has been through.  Students will learn about the holocaust and the effect it would have on those who had to live through it.  The fact that it is a graphic novel makes it very appealing."
"Untamed (House of Night, #4)",0312379838,"P.C. Cast, Kristin Cast",Barnes and Noble,4.5,BANCHEE_READS,"This is the fourth book in the House of Night series and was by far the best book of the series. It is the only book in the series so far that I have felt comfortable saying I really liked it and enjoyed the story.
With the murders of the teachers in the third book things are beginning to come to a head in this book. Zoey is out of boyfriends, so to speak, so of course she is absolutely enchanted by the new kid in school, Stark. With Stevie Rae somewhat her normal self, she takes a back seat in this story but still plays a few big parts as a new type of vampire. The mythos developed in this story around the evil Neferet was engaging and very interesting. Neferet is here in all her evil glory; and man is she evil.
Zoey without boyfriends is awesome because Zoey is actually focused on the actual plot and this makes for a way more interesting book than the last one was. So, for everyone who hung on with the series despite the barely okay third book, you are rewarded in this book."
"Untamed (House of Night, #4)",0312379838,"P.C. Cast, Kristin Cast",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Nicole_Redbird,"This book is sexy, mysterious, and will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very last word. Highly recommend!"
"Untamed (House of Night, #4)",0312379838,"P.C. Cast, Kristin Cast",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"I have enjoyed reading ""The House of Night"" series. I received the four books for Christmas and finished them in no time. The books are about a human-turned fledgling vampyre named Zoey Redbird who goes to a school called The House of Night where those like herself go to learn what they need to know before they become full-fledged vampyres, if they get that far. Some make it, some don't.
Zoey makes a lot of friends (and enemies), and I'm especially fond of her best friend Stevie Rae who has such a wonderful personality. As for her other friends, Damien and the Twins, well, they are, to me, quite boring.If anything were to happen to them I don't think I'd really care much. (I nearly died inside when I thought Stevie Rae was gone.) That says a lot.
As for the main character herself, she is not my favorite. Usually I like the main characters but Zoey tends to get into a lot of situations concerning boys and it's a bit annoying (I believe it was the third book that involved a lot of that). She started off with her human boyfriend Heath. Then got herself a vampyre-fledgling boyfriend, Eric. Then there's the vampyre Poet teacher Loren. And WHAT was with that Stark business? She didn't even KNOW the guy. I'm just thankful the books involve more than Zoey's boyfriend business, otherwise I wouldn't like these books very much.
There's always something new happening. The story never gets boring, which is excellent--- except when it involves Zoey's boyfriend woes.
Overall, I love this series and I can't wait for the next book."
"Speaker for the Dead (Ender's Saga, #2)",0812550757,Orson Scott Card,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"Posted 11/02/10: This book was written as the second book in a series but Orson Scott Card. Card tried to write it in a way that you could read it without any background knowledge. I have not read the first one yet and I would agree that you can read this book by itself; however there were some points in the book where a little background knowledge would have been nice. Orson Scott Card is an excellent writer. I loved how the main character, Ender Wiggin, seemed to know everything about other peoples past without really knowing anything at all. The tone in this book was excellent. The main character is portrayed as a brilliant and understanding person. However, some of my favorite characters in the story were the piggies, an alien species discovered on a planet that was going to be settled for human use, who got their nickname piggies from their pig like faces. Card dives so deeply into the feeling and emotions of each and every character that it is very easy to relate to each one. Another thing I like about this book was how life like the struggle was shown between the humans and piggies to understand and learn from each other. I didn't like the point in the book where the piggies innocently and ignorantly murdered two of the humans studying them. It was frustrating reading that part because the actions of the piggies were not explained until a lot farther into the book. I often enjoy science fiction books that take place in the future. In this book Card writes about the future in a believable fashion. I think the overall lesson that can be learned from this book is lying and hiding the truth will just hurt a lot worse in the long run. This is shown though both the humans and the piggies. One of the main human characters hides the truth from her family and does everything in her power to keep it hidden. When Ender comes he dives deep into her past and finds out the truth, it is hurtful to everyone especially her and her family. It takes some time, but life moves on much easier after everyone knows the truth. I really liked how Ender used his high position as Speaker For The Dead and his ultra smart computer friend to get information and respect from un-willing people, and it is amazing what he does with the information. The ending of this book doesn't really seem like an ending. The book seems to end with one chapter left. The last chapter seems to be dedicated to the groundwork for the next book. It has a cliff hanger ending for this reason which I didn't really like. I like books to come to a clear conclusion at the end but where this book is not the last book in the series Card still has a chance to wrap things up and I look forward to the place where he does. Overall, I enjoyed reading this book."
"Speaker for the Dead (Ender's Saga, #2)",0812550757,Orson Scott Card,Barnes and Noble,4.4,GeekyBeachBabe,"Orson Scott Card's Speaker for the Dead is quite a different story from Ender's Game, but it's a great one. The setting is new, the characters are mostly all new and Ender is 3,000 years older (sort of). Unlike the first book, my favorite parts of this book have almost nothing to do with Ender. Rather, I'm all about the aliens in this one.

Much of this story takes place before Ender even arrives, which gives the reader a great chance to acclimate to the new surroundings. We are now on the planet Lusitania and we're even further in the future. There are so many new and wonderful human characters in this book and each has their own separate identity; I both loved and hated most of them. (I think I also picked up a bit of Portuguese from reading this book!)

The alien characters, aka the ""Piggies"" are extremely complex and mysterious while at the same time very lovable. Never could I have imagined reading a book in which I care so much about the aliens (maybe more than the people!). Perhaps the best thing about this book is that no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't figure out the twist at the end so it was a real and unpredictable surprise ending which I love.

I really loved this book - it's one of those books you wish didn't have to end. If you've read Ender's Game and loved it, I think you''ll love this one, too.

[Side note: I have read the next two in the series, but my advice is that if you want to remember the good times, stop after Speaker for the Dead and that way you can always think of Ender fondly.]"
"Speaker for the Dead (Ender's Saga, #2)",0812550757,Orson Scott Card,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Barnesie,"When you read how Orson Scott Card came to write Speaker for the Dead, it's all but specifically stated that the entire book was conceived without the character of Ender existing within its text.  It comes as no surprise that when he plucks his biggest character from his biggest hit and inserts him into a storyline thousands of years in the future, it's a slightly uncomfortable fit.  At 3000 years old, Ender is all grow'd up and is now plodding forward in a new story that bears little connection to his previous existence in Enders Game.  He now finds himself wrapped up in a bio-evolutionary mystery plot, with a rag tag bunch of natives and his trusty omnipotent sidekick cracking wise from the ether of the universe.  Will Ender somehow unravel the mystery of the Piggies?  Will Ender fall in love?  Will Orson Scott Card introduce a predictable ticking time bomb and then leave a rack of open questions so that the next book is more of a ""part 2"" then a squeal?  I'll save you the trouble, the answer is yes."
Mere Christianity,0684823780,C.S. Lewis,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"The essentials of Christianity are presented in an enlightening, easy-to-grasp narrative.  Both Christian and non-Christians benefit from reading this book. Christians will gain new insights as to why they believe  non-Christians will find a brilliant exposition of basic Christian beliefs. It certainly will provoke you to carefully consider what and why you believe.  Lewis writes, 'You must make your choice. Either this man [Christ] was, and is, the Son of God: or else a madman or something worse...But let us not come with any patronising nonsense about his being a great human teacher.'"
Mere Christianity,0684823780,C.S. Lewis,Barnes and Noble,4.4,WriterAtTheSea,"This book should be savored.  Hands down, it is probably one of my favorite books covering simple Christian beliefs without dragging dogma or denominational theory into it.  The brilliant Lewis appeals to both logic and common sense.  For the believer, this book should not be missed, and for the non-believer, Mere Christianity offers a logical, persuasive argument for belief.  It is probably one of the most influential Christian books in the twentieth century. His presentation and argument for the case for belief in Christ is profound.  I don't think there is a book that has affected my faith more outside of scripture."
Mere Christianity,0684823780,C.S. Lewis,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"I have read this book many times at many different places in my life. When I arrogantly assume I know all there is to know and that I am such a well-learned scholar that someone like Lewis must be overrated and it is my job to perform an exhaustive analysis, I find this book, and truthfully anything else I read, falls short.  However, when I humbly open my heart and mind and ask questions such as, 'Does God exist?' 'Does God really love me?' and 'What can I learn about God through this?' I find that I am filled with the wonder and joy that Lewis offers like a gift.  Read up on Lewis' life and you will find that he was disappointed by life and love - yes he did fall in love - and learned time and time again to rest in the wonder and peace of God. This book is an installment in his life's work.  Don't make the mistake of reading this through the filter of arrogance - no matter how well-educated you are or how much you think you know."
The Secret History,1400031702,Donna Tartt,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"What makes 'The Secret History' such a   compelling book is its daring to examine the  consequences of the arrogance of intellectual superiority, something I   struggled with in my youth, something which I sometimes find myself struggling with today.  Those of us who were products of accelerated  academic programs, who fell under the   auspicious acronmym AP (for Advanced Placement) often felt removed from our peers and masked our underlying feelings of inferiority as erudite superiority.  It is a defence mechanism many of us used when young,and sometimes continue to use as a means we tell ourselves of making us feel better about who we are.  The students in  TSH, even the sympathetic narrator Richard  Papen, exemplify these ideas and the impulses  these feelings cause them to act out are shown as having the direst of moral consequences to which they as a group and individually must answer for.      The pleasures of intellectual stimulation   coupled with the psychological underpinings of the deed done and how it is played out give TSH its literary resonance.  In addition the book provides a builti in mystery of its own--namely the literary future, or if there is to be one, of its author, Donna Tartt.    Upon a first reading nearly ten years ago,   I embraced TSH and Donna Tartt as a voice I wanted to hear more of--a voice which has been noticeably and mysteriously silent, which has only served to build up the legend, and rumors of an impending second novel sometime next year.  This remains to be seen but TSH continues to remain a book I turn to time and again for its exploration of moral arrogance and the destruction such attitudes can incur."
The Secret History,1400031702,Donna Tartt,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"I read it 3 years ago and im back looking it up hoping to find some clues to another, similar book.  I have found some people seem to not like it and that baffles me.  Great mystery, suspense.   I was genuinely sad it was finished when it was over."
The Secret History,1400031702,Donna Tartt,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,A really tense mystery;  well-defined characters. You want to reach out and implore them to stop.  Intelligence and narcissism and exclusivity and wealth and bored youth are a dangerous mix.
A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,0375725784,Dave Eggers,Barnes and Noble,3.8,MontyGeorge,"""A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius"" is a strange, confusing, out of order, dizzying ride.... fabulous book!  Worth the read, but not for casual readers as you'll want to finish the book in one sitting.  Eggers is a ""trip""."
A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,0375725784,Dave Eggers,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Jessie93,Definitely an interesting read.  You need patience to read this book.  Eggers is a total scatter-brains. There will be numerous time throughout the book that you will feel like there is no point to the book at all. You will read page after page of nothing.  The young Eggers in this memoir can be very self-absorbed and that is very annoying. Some parts are mildly entertaining and his thought process is completely over the top.  Seems like a good book for a psychologist to read and then come up with a proper diagnosis.
A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,0375725784,Dave Eggers,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Anonymous,"I found the book difficult to read because of the writer's self absorbtion. However,it was touching how he showed his love for his young brother and how he cared for him. But all through the book I kept thinking about his ""flight of ideas""and overworked imagination.

"The Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children, #1)",0553381679,Jean M. Auel,Barnes and Noble,4.4,MagiV,"So sad - I have all of this series in hard copy, but really wanted them on my new Nook, especially with the new Land of the Painted Caves coming out next month!  I started reading at the beginning, and was immediately struck by how AWFUL the translation to eBook had been - NEVER occurred to me that B&N didn't get access to the electronic files which the printers use when printing up new books, right? - NEVER occurred to me these books were OCRed, which means that many times the words are incorrect or missing.  There are formatting issues like italics where it does not belong, a sentence that runs right off the page of the Nook never wrapping around.  Punctuation that was incorrect or completely missing.  And, unlike the old classics, we have to PAY for this.  I actually needed to use my hard copy to be sure of what I was reading - in each edition!
I wrote a letter of disgust to B&N, and was told - in short, that my issues were being sent on to the publisher and when they made corrections, it would automatically be uploaded to my Nook - BUT, that I was not entitled to any kind of refund per B&N blah, blah, blah....  Very sad.  I have many other books on my Nook that are 10 & 20 years old yet there are no ""typos"" in those books.  Be warned!"
"The Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children, #1)",0553381679,Jean M. Auel,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"My father read the books, and everytime he read a few chapters, he went into my room to tell me all about it. After he finished, he gave the books to me. I was fifteen, and layed them away for a year. After that year I found them again, and read the first page. I almost read the entire chapter there, down of the floor in front of my bookcase.  I have never before and probably will never again fall in love with a book as much as I did with these. And especially The Clan of the Cavebear. I've just read it for the eleventh time (for real!) and still found things I missed the first times. These books opened my eyes to the full experience of reading a book. Not only reading, but seeing, feeling, living and breathing a book. I can absolutely recommend it to everyone, although you do have to consider all the extra text concerning the environment and animals present. I loved them, I love to learn, but others will find it difficult to read long descriptions. In any way, it is a book worth reading, more than most are!"
"The Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children, #1)",0553381679,Jean M. Auel,Barnes and Noble,4.4,FosterHope,"I first read this book years ago, and it impacted by adult reading choices more than any other book I've read. This story draws you in, to another time, to another person, to another way of thinking. This book is less tedious than Auel's later books, more meat to the story, less descriptive fluff."
Black Beauty,0439228905,Anna Sewell,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"When I first picked up this book, it was a late in the evening at the local library.  I was a young girl, barely eight years old and I was struggling with some very difficult situations at home.  There was a rift in my family, centered around me and it caused me to burrow into myself, not allowing for the easy childhood friendships that I should have had.  At that time I was discovering books, but they were not quite what I was looking for.  Sort of like picking up appears to be a soft drink and finding out it's really tea.  Bearable, but not quite right.  So I went looking for a book, not because I was aware of what I really needed, but because my young soul was lonely and broken.  Black Beauty and I spent much of the next few weeks together as I read and then reread the story over and again.  He understood my pain like no one else ever could.  Together we raced the wind under fair weather and toiled up great hills against odds that no one should ever have had to face.  He was my companion, as I was his.  Recently, I picked up the book again and found myself dwelling on those long ago days.  I can still remember the feel of soft grass as I lay with Black Beauty, full of pain but still able to gaze upon the bright flowers around me.  To be able to see beauty, even when life is not at its best, was the gift that I most needed and the lesson that the story teaches us all."
Black Beauty,0439228905,Anna Sewell,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,Black Beauty is a great book about a horse. It's a book about a horse's life and his point of view about life.Black Beauty expresses his so well you would think Anna Sewell the author was actually a horse because she knows so much about a horse's point of view and their lives. This book is so wonderful that sometimes it seems as if you want to be a horse just like Black Beauty! This is by far the greatest classic I have ever read! I will remember this book forever because of Black Beauty's loyalty to his owners no matter how much he was mistreated by some of them! Black Beauty will always stand in my mind as the greatest horse book of all times!

American Psycho,0679735771,Bret Easton Ellis,Barnes and Noble,4.1,ChesterfieldWatts,"""American Psycho"" is not only a great critique of the 80's yuppie culture, but it is a scathing criticism of a nation's moral decay. The book is very well written, and it has a style that creates a world easily accessible to the reader. The book creates a dissonance from real life and the actual plot that leaves the reader questioning if our narrator, dear Patrick, is a reliable source or nothing more than a raving mad-man. The wonder of Ellis's writing is that, while asking this question, the overwhelming fact is that it doesn't really matter. While Bateman, the main character, is a psychopathic killer, it is easy to empathize with him and understand his frustrations. The writing style is unique and makes it easy to get into Bateman's mindset. I usually am not a detail-oriented reader, and I often prefer to have my own imagination work than the author's descriptions, but long sections devoted to clothes and other such details really are a pleasure to read in this book, mostly because they help the reader see the world as Bateman does. A unique read to be certain, but wildly entertaining."
American Psycho,0679735771,Bret Easton Ellis,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"To each his own... but personally I find the conplaints about the over abundance of details, especially regarding the clothing brands, to be an absolute joke. Dismissing these details as mundane is dismissing tge entire message of the book. Theyre yuppies... every thing was scrutinized down to the last detail. Where you ate, what you ordered, who you were with, what you wore, who cut your hair... these details were everything that mattered. 

As for the violence, its a sattire and the book is halarious. The point is the extreme of being such a ridiculous yuppy that your more worried about reservations than your compulsion to kill and also hating everyone but helplessly obsessing over having everyone love you..."
American Psycho,0679735771,Bret Easton Ellis,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Stumpyboner,"This book is awful. I read it due to a friend's recommendation. I didn't realize at the time that he was a hip counter-culture kind of guy (the kind that tell you that the things you like are terrible, and that terrible things are good). American Psycho has no plot at all. The book begins with an intriguing literary method of hooking the reader. Bret E. Ellis introduces us to the neuroses of the Antagonist, Patrick; this is done by way of first-person introspection into Patrick's inner thoughts. This is fantastic, hence the one star that I did give the book. After that, there is no plot progression at all. There is no dichotomy to exploit between characters, no antagonist, and even Patrick lacks any dynamic character development. There is no plot; that is not to say that the plot is poor; there is no plot at all. This book is just a perpetual repetition of the (at first) intriguing introspection into Patrick's psyche, and his resultant outbursts of rage.
I find the repetition insulting. If this book was a novella, then it may have been brilliant; Ellis' one narrative hook is unable to carry a reader who enjoys a dynamic journey complete with plot, conflict, and character development."

The book gives insight into life and tradition in some parts of Africa. While there aren't any what you'd call belly laughs, there is humor throughout the book, a lot of human nature both good and bad, and many small mysteries instead of one or two big ones like in the more conventional mysteries we're used to. A good read once you adapt to the style."

The best word to describe the book is ""quirky"", but in a good way.  The writing style was not typical and the characters had an interesting way of conveying what they wanted to say without actually saying it.  I had not heard of the series before, but I plan on reading the rest of the books in the series and I have added the HBO television series to my Netflix queue as well."

I really enjoyed the setting and the way the local culture and proctocol were defined.  Having read another reivew, I was always on the lookout for the ""man bashing"" parts.  I  have to admit there was a tendency to generalize men and their ""bad"" habits, but it was not so much offensive as it was quirky.  I have to remember that this tendency to mistrust men came from the heroine's background and history.  Funny; sweet; and sad all at the same time.  A quick read and I will most certainly look for and read other books by this author.  Surprised that this was a male author."
"The Walking Dead, Vol. 01: Days Gone Bye",1582406723,"Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Suvorov,"Graphic novels are not my thing so giving this five stars is a really big thing. When I first saw the previews of the tv series, I wanted to read the comics first. I was hooked from the beginning.
 
Since I am accustomed to very long books, The Walking Dead seemed a little choppy at first. In addition, I had some problems following the bubbles and would mix them up, which of course messes up the flow and tempo because I had to go back and re-read. But I quickly got the flow of it and the reading got easier.
 
I am in the process of reading the series a second time. I am taking it slower and studying the pictures better, which obviously enhances the story- something I am sure any graphic novel/ comic fan would tell you is a must. I am enjoying it even more the second time around. For any first time readers, I would recommend reading slowly. It is tempting to get through it fast just to finish it, but it is much more satisfying to take your time. Also, you'll remember more and when you watch the tv series, that will help you compare the tv show with the series.
 
I think Kirkman did a great job developing the characters quickly. Right away I had my favorites. Unfortunately, my least favorite character is Lori. She is a nag, nowhere near self-sufficient and has totally refused to accept that her environment has drastically changed and she will have to change with it if she wants to survive. It's annoying.
 
And no one is safe. So while you may not be able to detach yourself from a particular character, don't be surprised if that character doesn't make it. Even main characters aren't safe. That is one of the things I really like about Kirkman. He can make me scream at a book.
 
If you have already watched the tv series, you will notice a lot of differences from the very beginning. While the tv series stays true to the spirit of the books, the details are much different. Characters are different and they don't die in the same order or in the same way. I know some people don't like that, but I think it works in this case. If the tv series was exactly the same, there would be no surprises for me. This way, while I know the general direction of the tv series, I am constantly surprised.
 
Bottom line, give it a try. This is coming from someone who had never read a graphic novel before this one. Now I follow 4 different series. The Walking Dead may make a convert out of you."
"The Walking Dead, Vol. 01: Days Gone Bye",1582406723,"Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Ravenswood_Reviews,"ROBERT KIRKMAN'S ""WALKING DEAD: DAYS GONE BY""
(A REVIEW)

Once upon a time I was one of those women that was scared to death of zombies and I wouldn't even watch anything that had them on it. I didn't want to see pictures I would turn my head in disgust and literally run away almost screaming at the sight. I think deep down it was always the thought of 'what if' that kept me from wanting to have anything to do with a genre that is becoming rapidly more popular. Those days ended when my husband decided we were going to watch ""The Walking Dead"" on AMC.

I was instantly hooked, and it really had nothing to do with the zombies as much as it did the humanity of the people that were still living. The books are no different. Having read the first one in a series I can honestly say I intend to seek them all out one by one.
You get a feeling of what it would truly be like to live through such a horrible plague and discover that you are perhaps one of the last living people on the planet. There is emotion, turmoil, truth and sincerity in these graphic novels as well as the show on television.

You soon even begin to feel sorry for those that have been turned and you have to ask yourself what you would do if that happened to someone in your family. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised and now I'm not as horrified by the zombies as I once was. Robert Kirkman has done a phenomenal job and I can only hope he'll continue with the story for as long as he can.

"The Walking Dead, Vol. 01: Days Gone Bye",1582406723,"Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Mr_E58,"Being a fan of the series on AMC I thought the comic series might prove interesting. Jeeze was I right. Despite knowing the gist of some of the goings on in the beginning due to the tv series, I found the read still very addicting. The only time I became upset was when I finished reading because I needed more...

All in all, Days Gone Bye is an awesome read and I suggest those interested should buy it. I know I will be buying the rest of the series."

I balked at reading it at first and put it off for a good year or so before I finally picked it up and I was blown away. It is haunting, creepy, funny, spot-on scripture, romantic, and thrilling. The authors have expertly wrapped fiction around scripture, without losing any of the credibility and viability of Biblical doctrine, rather enforcing it. For those with a spiritual interest in the Rapture and Endtimes prophesies, this book is a must!"

I'm not a person that even likes church, and if I had my choice I wouldn't go, so you could easily see my preconceived ideas of this book, but when I read it and I just couldn't put it down. I was so wrapped up in the plot and the storylines, that at parts I felt like I was one of the characters in the book. Left behind was one of the best books I've read, and now I'm on 'Apollyon.'

"The Hunger Games Trilogy Boxset (The Hunger Games, #1-3)",0545265355,Suzanne Collins,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"This trilogy is the best thing to hit bookshelves in a long time. I read ""The Hunger Games"" in one sitting, and then reread it immediately, it was that good. And before ""Catching Fire"" came out, I read it again. And before ""Mockingjay"" came out, I read the first two again. I COULD NOT STOP READING THESE! (clearly!) This is definitely a must read. I felt pain and joy and sorrow and confusion along with Katniss and all of the other characters. I cried at the happy and sad times (mostly at the sad). I cried when I finished ""Mockingjay"" because I knew it was the end. The story told throughout these three books is so moving and intriguing and un-put-downable. I've read moving books before, but I couldn't believe a story could make me feel this much. And it wasn't just the plotline; the characters, the problems, the ""supporting"" characters, things people said, all of it was amazing. And a lot of the moral values in this book can be applied to our lives today. It's a warning for things that could happen in the future if power falls into the wrong hands. Some of the things said in ""Mockingjay"" hit something inside me and I can't believe someone else who I've never met could affect me so intensely. I felt that I was Katniss and was being forced to make all of these impossible decisions and do these impossible things. I still can't believe how amazing these books are. They are definitely for a higher maturity level, but I think it's impossible to outgrow them. Definitely good for teens. Though it is fiction, it's definitely not your ""fantasy"" vampires and dragons and fairies story, but I don't see how anyone could NOT like these books. I wish I could give more than five stars, possibly an infinite amount? Because these books definitely deserve them all. And THANK YOU SUZANNE COLLINS for bringing these books into the world!!! I know that's cheesy, but it's well deserved!"
Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America,0805063897,Barbara Ehrenreich,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Guest,"This book was horrible.  I can't believe that I gave this person money!    The author doesn't bother to really understand what she is writing about.  She is consistently surprised that the poor folks around her aren't impressed with her PhD.... and what's sick is that she doesn't get that a PhD shouldn't impress the working poor.    Why does she feel that she is so much better than everyone else...  why doesn't she bother to find out how the people around her are actually making it work?  How in Gods green can she have problems getting by for ONE month when she has a paid for rental car, $1000 going into the experiment and an income, however meager?  Why does she feel that eating off you lap is a major plight of the working poor that she has to write about it?  Has she never been to a picnic?     The idea was fabulous... it's too bad she ruined it.  Lastly, no real suggestions to solve the problem?  Raise minimum wage?  Doesn't she realize that the cost for product will rise too... and still a worker at Wal-Mart won't be able to afford to shop there?    All I got from this book was that a spoiled child couldn't figure out how to live on less.  Bummer for her.  Fortunately most people on the planet are a little more crafty and intelligent.    Finally, we as Americans only need to look to other countries to understand what poor really is."
Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America,0805063897,Barbara Ehrenreich,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Guest,"While the author's experiment is certainly intriguing and even worthwhile, objectivity is quickly clouded by Ehrenreich's opinions on various social issues.  During the brief time she works as a maid, she's pretentious enough to criticize the people who own the homes she is cleaning. She implies that these owners, many of whom she has never met, must be mean, selfish people because they actually own something of monetary value and are paying to have it cleaned.  The possibility that they may have earned money through hard work to buy their possessions never seems to occur to her. Of course, this might have broken her moment of self-righteousness.   Likewise, on page 100, she describes how self-conscious and ostracized she feels about wearing her garish maid's uniform in a supermarket, saying that she's 'getting a tiny glimpse of what it would be like to be black.' In today's society, that is hardly an accurate comparison. If anything, maybe she got a glimpse of how a disfigured or physically handicapped person may feel, but I doubt such people go about their daily routines with the indignant paranoia she displayed.  Granted, there are injustices everywhere in America. However, it still remains the best country in the world for individuals to achieve their goals and attain economic comfort. It is up to the idividual to take the initiative for improvement; no one else can do it for them."
Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America,0805063897,Barbara Ehrenreich,Barnes and Noble,3.6,AdditionalReport,"The setting of this book begins in the place at where Ehrenreich lives, Key West, Florida as she decides to start her low-wage life. The plot of this book begins as Ehrenreich is planning her project on how people live in a low- wage life, and the problems that they may come across, like affording a place to live. After leaving her normal life for this project her first task was to find a place to live, since she figured she would probably make around $7 an hour. But once she found a job at Hearthside she found out that her salary was for $2.43 an hour and eventually decided to find another job at Jerry&rsquo;s in order to live. From there she started moving a couple of more times because she could not find to work with such a low-wage and have enough money for the necessities she may have to come across. In her evaluation she explains how housing is really expensive but, wages have not increased. The main character of this book was Ehrenreich the one who was doing the project to experience a low- wage job. There were also many other characters in which she came across when she was working at different places. The theme of this book is poverty because poverty had a great role in Ehrenreich&rsquo;s book throughout the book she demonstrates the difficulty of survival with a low-waged job. She shows that there are so many other people that are actually living their lives with so many limitations and, things they have to sacrifice like health insurance that may eventually leave them in debt if anything ever really happened.

"The Great Hunt (Wheel of Time, #2)",0812517725,Robert Jordan,Barnes and Noble,4.7,HouseOfReads,"Although I'm sure this book stands alone as a good read, I can only recommend starting from the first, The Eye of the World, and continuing onward. This is a great series; the characters are awesome and you will want to be one of them. The women rock, and are in no way to be confused with drippy, moony, boring, shrieky, ditzy dipsticks with heaving bosoms so common in much of the genre. These gals will kick your sorry bum! Though a fantasy world, the books traffic in the collision of cultures from martial to natural, fundamentalist to liberal and everything in between. It's a really neat way of considering any kind of cultural conflict, in addition to a rip-roaring good story. Pick these books up and dig in to this world!"
"The Great Hunt (Wheel of Time, #2)",0812517725,Robert Jordan,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Guest,"Loved this book, but like The Eye of The World, I thought that Jordan gets so verbose in the first couple of chapters, that its hard to get too deeply into his world soon enough to continue on.  The sequence in which Rand is seeking to escape Dal Fara goes on forever and I thought at times that the entire book would be just that.  If he entered one more room and described it down to cracks in the floor, I was going to put the book down forever.  Comparitively, the final battle at Falme, what I thought was some great suspense writing, takes 3 pages at best.  I'm certainly going to continue with the series, but hope that it doesn't bog down again."
"The Great Hunt (Wheel of Time, #2)",0812517725,Robert Jordan,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Guest,"Robert Jordan is pure genious!  He is the most amazing author to come into this world.  I have read through his 4th book (The Shadow Rising) and I am never dissapointed with anything that Robert has dished out towards us, the readers.  Among all of his books that I have read so far, I think that The Great Hunt would have to be the most enchanting one yet.  With non-stop action around every corner.  It is truly amazing.  The Great Hunt shows the struggle of a young man chosen to live a life that could mean the end of the whole world if he becomes mad.  He was chosen to be the dragon reborn, followed by some other Ta'veren, who also happen to be close friends of his.  The story  brings new heroes and more amazing events than the first, in this massive story of magical sedai and warriors in this gigantic world of fantasy.  Robert Jordan...Bravo!!!!!!!!"

I love all the novels in the Kay Scarpetta series but this one just sticks with you. The psychological aspect of the plot; the fact that the killer is attacking women not within the same ethnic race; was very fascinating. I could not figure out who the culprit might be and was shocked and disturbed when it was finally revealed. I read this book twelve years ago and the sense of fear still stays with me. If you like this book, you may also enjoy: the novels of Tess Gerittsen, Tami Hoag (A Thin Dark Line, Ashes to Ashes, Dust to Dust), James Patterson's Kiss the Girls, and the true-crime books of Ann Rule."
"Postmortem (Kay Scarpetta, #1)",0743477154,Patricia Cornwell,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"I read this book for the first time many years ago, but it is still the best murder mystery I have ever read.  I pull it out at least once a year to read it over and over again.  It is so captivating that I read it straight through everytime."
The Complete Stories and Poems,0385074077,Edgar Allan Poe,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,Great book and deffinitly worth the money. Poe was a genius.
The Complete Stories and Poems,0385074077,Edgar Allan Poe,Barnes and Noble,4.4,mldavis2 on LibraryThing,"Much of Poe rates a 5-star.  I read the complete works which included many early poems, a genre that Poe professed to love, and some secondary early works that lack the polish and sophistication of his masterpieces, hence the overall 4-star rating.  I find Poe somewhat of a humorist with his occasional use of absurd character names and his tongue-in-cheek sophisticated language in many of his tales, including those usually associated with horror.I don't know if I would expect readers to plow through the entire 5-book set of complete works as I did, but as a truly American writer, poet and analyst, Poe has set some benchmarks that led to later writers such as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories and other forensic efforts.  This set is well worth exploring for Poe's influence on later writers."
The Complete Stories and Poems,0385074077,Edgar Allan Poe,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Terpsichoreus on LibraryThing,"Not many people outside of literary study or detective fiction fandom realize that the character of Sherlock Holmes was inspired by Poe's Dupin. Dupin was the brilliant and insightful idle noble who occasionally aided the authorities in particularly difficult cases. However, unlike Holmes, Dupin took it up merely as a hobby, mimicking Holmes' brother Mycroft.I'm not fond of Poe's poetry. Emerson's leveling of 'Jingle Man' is appropriate. Poe puts sounds together, but usually says very little with them. It is unusual that his prose was so varied while his poetry tended to obsessive repetition. Poe presents an example of the turning point when poetry ceased to represent the most complex and dense literary form (as in Milton and Eliot) and became the most frivolous and unrefined (the beat poets), while prose moved contrarily from the light-hearted to the serious.When divorced from his single-minded prosody, Poe's mastery of the language elegantly serves the needs of mood, characterization, and action. This is not always the case: his Ligeia retains his poetic narrowness, but his detective stories have a gentleness and wit found nowhere else in his oeuvre.The three Dupin stories helped to inspire detective fiction, using suspense and convoluted mystery to tantalize and challenge the reader. He may not have been as influential or innovative as Wilkie Collins, but his contribution still stands.Any book of Poe's is worth purchasing simply for these three stories. They are studies in the careful use of language to develop mood, character, and drive--even in a sparse plot. They are not quite the equals of Ambrose Bierce's short fiction, but they are solid enough."
The Hiding Place: The Triumphant True Story of Corrie Ten Boom,0553256696,"Corrie ten Boom, John Sherrill, Elizabeth Sherrill",Barnes and Noble,4.6,purtle,This book was very good! like awesomely good! It's about a woman hiding Jews in her house during the holocaust and they get caught. She and her family is taken to prison and later put in a concentration camp. It is a very touching and inspirational story. If you want something to read in a cozy chair one rainy afternoon this is the book.
The Hiding Place: The Triumphant True Story of Corrie Ten Boom,0553256696,"Corrie ten Boom, John Sherrill, Elizabeth Sherrill",Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"We have all heard the story of the holocaust. It was a tragic experience for many and to this day, this black mark on human history haunts the lives of numerous souls. While there are an abundant amount of books about the holocaust, The Hiding Place has a quality in which none of the rest have, or so I have found. It is a story of a dedicated Christian girl living in Holland during the reign of Hitler. While she is initially safe because of her religion and background, her family and her quickly learn how serious it is, to even befriend an undesirable (Jew). The consequences may be worse than death itself. 
	Since it is non fiction, The Hiding Place is incredibly accurate and descriptive of the true happenings of Corrie Ten Boom's life. I absolutely loved the book. It was filled with every emotion imaginable. I found myself laughing one moment and crying the next. There is truly not much to dislike. If anything, I found myself wanting a more detailed account of what happened in parts. Corrie Ten Boom has done an amazing job at recounting her tale. Being in first person, she captures you and you seem to become a part of the Ten Boom family; sharing with all their joy and pain. 
	The Hiding Place is a great book for just about any age. Whether just starting high school, or you have children of your own, it is a book that will engage any audience member. The lesson of forgiveness and courage to stand up for your own beliefs is one any person of any age can learn and gain from. To think of how many people suffered though this tragic experience and lived full productive lives is encouraging. I feel I can now face anything life throws at me with just a little faith and determination. 
	If you enjoy this book or books about or involving the Holocaust, you may also enjoy I Stand at the Door and Knock by Corrie Ten Boom,? A Prisoner and Yet... by Corrie Ten Boom,? and The Diary of Anne Frank by Anne Frank.?"
The Hiding Place: The Triumphant True Story of Corrie Ten Boom,0553256696,"Corrie ten Boom, John Sherrill, Elizabeth Sherrill",Barnes and Noble,4.6,Goose315,"This book is about Faith and God's love. Despite all of the horror and evil around them, the ten Boom family never gave up hope and continued to help others to cope with the unjust treatment of people during World War II by sharing the word of a loving God. The Hiding Place is a book about a Christian family who risked their own lives to save as many Jewish people as they could from being hunted down by the Nazis during World War II. They knew that hiding the Jews in their home and later moving them through the secret underground network was against the laws of the land however, it was absolutely the right thing to do as Christians. Their faith drove them to care more about the people who were being persecuted than their selves. When the secret room was discovered and the ten Boom's were sent to concentration camps as punishment, the reader questions God's hand. We later learn that their faith was far more useful in the camps. I could not stand to read how awful the Nazis were. I do not understand why the German public didn't rebel and stop the madness. I was riveted by the graphic tales of the concentration camp life for the prisoners. I also could not stand that the Germans would disguise themselves to catch people going against the law. I think that was a little too far. I liked how the ten Boom's continued to risk their own safety and how they came up with clever codes to protect their Jews and themselves. When they built the secret room, it was amazing how small the room was, and how many people they could squeeze into it. You just knew that only God could have protected them for so long. It was moving to see how God worked through Corrie ten Boom as she became a prisoner and yet, she continued to help others in the camp by referring them to God. I also like how the history of World War II comes to life through this book. You should definitely read this book if you want a real personal view of what life was like for a Christian family during the Nazi era. This is a true story and it is written by Miss ten Boom herself. The Hiding Place is an encouraging book about unending Faith and love during unbelievable times. I haven't read any other of the ten Boom books but, I would like to. My overall rating of this book would be a 4.5."

The Prince of Tides,0553381547,Pat Conroy,Barnes and Noble,4.3,PHMMD,"I've read a lot of books, and this one has always topped my list of favorites.  There's something about the way that Pat Conroy writes that just draws me in (I even enjoyed ""My Losing Season"", and I have absolutely no interest in basketball) -- his descriptions can conjure up a place or a person in a way that makes you not just see what he's describing, but really KNOW it.  I have South Carolina in my blood, and this book makes me feel that in a way that really shocked me the first time I read it.  As other readers have said, this book is FAR better than the movie it inspired; it is an absolutely spellbinding piece of literature and one that you can't possibly forget.  I am thrilled that it's now an eBook -- I plan to read it many more times on my nook!  Pat Conroy is my all-time favorite author, and I truly feel that ""The Prince of Tides"" is his best."
The Prince of Tides,0553381547,Pat Conroy,Barnes and Noble,4.3,SC2NY,"I confess that the 5 stars I gave this book are because of the way it takes me back home - to the South Carolina Lowcountry. As a transplant to the NYC Metro Area, the novel's setting couldn't be more perfect for me. Tom Wingo is a bit crude, but his tales of home are enough to make me want to pack up the moving truck and move back to Charleston.

Conroy does a good job of mixing stories of the past and present without treating the reader like a child who needs hand-holding. The transitions can be as abrupt as an errant thought, but also come at predictable moments. There is variety, humor, love and just about every other intense human emotion.

P.S. - As usual, the book is MUCH BETTER than the movie."

I cried I smiled I laughed... thank-you for sharing your talent....I can still smell the ocean breeze...you made my crazy life growing up in our own madness feel like it's ok,  keeping family secrets was nothing to be ashamed of, and for the first time in my life I felt true compassion and understanding...

The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay,0312282990,Michael Chabon,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"If you want to indulge yourself in Escapism at its fullest, definitely read ""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay"". This book is so spell-binding, you will sometimes forget you are reading a work of fiction. The characters come to life on the pages of the book, as well as in the comic books Joe and Sammy write. At times you will sympathize with Joe, then yell at Anapol, be mystified by Rosa, and hope for Tommy. All in all, this is an utterly fascinating book! Be prepared to have a dictionary near you at all times!"
The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay,0312282990,Michael Chabon,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Lisa_RR_H,"I suppose given this is my first book by Chabon, I shouldn't yet say I have a new favorite writer, but I can say after this one I want to go out and read all this others. First, the author is wonderful at conjuring up WWII era New York City--especially as a native New Yorker I loved how he took me to that time. The novel also somehow in its characters and events gives me a new understanding of what went into the imagining of comic books from the feats of Houdini to the yearning to punch Hitler in the face. It makes me care and feel for the characters, particularly Joe--you feel his desperation trying to get his family--his Jewish family--out of Nazi Europe. As many takes on the Holocaust as I've seen, I can't recall a work that shows you this aspect of it--not of those trying to get out but those trying to get them in and those attempts lend a great deal of suspense and later poignancy. Then there's the style--I can't say enough about the style. Reading I'm reminded of some virtuoso on the piano or violin miraculously playing some work by Liszt. The work is in done in omniscient voice--rarely seen in the last century and so rarely done well, but here it's a great deal of the pleasure in reading this story--beautifully, sometimes sensuously written, insightful with flashes of humor, a wonderful imagination and the sort of story you're sorry to come to an end. I left it feeling this was a story for the ages--but it was something else I've rarely read in so-called ""literary fiction""--great fun to read."
The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay,0312282990,Michael Chabon,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"I have never been an enormous fan of comic books, yet when a friend of mine recommended this novel to me, I took him up on it.  I found it to be an amazing, incredibly human story.  The description was vivid and realistic, easily understood, yet the author used words in ways I had never seen before.  The characters, I found, were as real to me as my friends, and I found the well-placed comic relief a welcome break from the depth of the story-who would have thought, in a book about comics?  As much as I would love to keep this book to myself, I feel it deserves every ounce of praise it receives, and I think that every award it was given could not do it justice."

It's officially my favorite book && in my opinion, the best book ever written. For someone obsessed with Twilight, I never thought there'd ever be a book better than it...BUT THERE IS!!!! this book made me laugh, cry, and swoon for alex. i yelled at the characters when they did something stupid, just like i would yell at the tv. I visualized everything that was happening and I can rarely do that. Although im mad that in that Perfect Chemistry video on this site, the guy playing alex is ugly as you know what. but anyway, i highly recommend this book. its amazing. it makes me want to move to illinois so i can find me an alejandro fuentes. soooooo, i think twilight obsessers should read this book because once you do, you won't be obsessed with twilight anymore because this beats that...bar none.
AMEN!!"
"Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry, #1)",0802798233,Simone Elkeles,Barnes and Noble,4.8,Anonymous,"I read all the time, and I've read more than half of the teen books on the shelf at Barnes and Noble. But out of all of the books I've read, this is definitely one of my all-time favorites. I love how real the story seems. You can picture almost picture Alex's cocky grin, and see Brittany fall for him. This book may have a typical happily ever after ending, but from the way Simone Elkeles goes about it you realize it's one of a kind. This story is so intense from the gang warfare to the school projects. I've read it twice, and i still can't put it down."
"Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry, #1)",0802798233,Simone Elkeles,Barnes and Noble,4.8,Anonymous,"Prefect Chemistry, by Simone Elkeles, explains the lives of two very different people living in the north and south side of Chicago. The main two protagonists are Alex Fuentes and Brittany Elias. Alex is a Hispanic boy associated with a gang called the Latino Blood. He is very fit and very protective of his family. Brittany Elias is your typical rich American girl. She&rsquo;s the most popular girl in school, captain of the cheerleading squad, and her boyfriend is the star quarterback. Alex and Brittany first meet on the first day of senior year. Brittany almost crashed into Alex&rsquo;s motorcycle in the parking lot which causes a little argument between them. Their first encounter doesn&rsquo;t go well, but they&rsquo;re in for a surprise. They have just found out they will have each other in the same chemistry class, and to top it off they&rsquo;re partners. Alex and his new partner can&rsquo;t seem to work right. They argue over every little thing and can&rsquo;t seem to agree on something simple, such as where to work on their project. As time goes by, they get closer and feel comfortable with each other. They have now realize they both have secrets, secrets that can be dangerous if anyone where to hear about them. Brittany has always portrayed herself to be the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; girl and Alex has always acted as a tough guy, but are these two characters really what they say to be? Brittany&rsquo;s life at home is horrible. Her dad is almost always away on business and unable to help emotionally at home. Her mom is under a lot of pressure because her oldest daughter has a mental disorder and worries that one day her friends will discover she has been lying about her &ldquo;perfect life.&rdquo; Alex has to seem tough so no one messes with his family seeing how his father was killed when he was six, and now has that responsibility. He knows it&rsquo;s hard for his mother to support three kids on minimum wage, so he&rsquo;s decided to make something out of his life. Not caring about the world and their inner conflicts, Brittany and Alex decide to begin a relationship. Once publicly displayed, trouble is not far behind. Brittany&rsquo;s parents highly disagree of such romance, and Alex has now gotten himself into some trouble with the leader of the Latino Blood and he can&rsquo;t seem to get out of. When asked to do a special job, will Alex listen to the promise he made Brittany or do the job to learn information about his father&rsquo;s murder? I would extremely recommend this book not only to girls who love high school romance, but to guys as well. I say this because I myself am I guy and I have to confess I did enjoy reading this book. This was the first book I&rsquo;ve ever read that&rsquo;s been written in alternative-first person point of view and had me flipping pages almost every minute. At some points I would chuckle. This author really captured the protagonist&rsquo;s feelings and made them sound like believable characters. Seeing how I took pleasure in reading Perfect Chemistry, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind reading other books with a similar plot or by Simone Elkeles. When using flashbacks, Elkeles descriptions are very detailed. When reading these parts of the book I felt myself right in the middle of the action. I don&rsquo;t regret reading this book and I trust neither will you. If you have already read this book I suggest you read to following ones: Rules of Attraction and Chain Reaction."
Peter Pan,0805072454,"J.M. Barrie, Michael Hague",Barnes and Noble,4,Charlotte_Isabella,"This is not your typical Disney version of Peter Pan. This version is actually very heart wrenching. It tells the story of Peter Pan, Tiger Lily, and the Lost Boys of course, but the Disney version only sugar coats the story where everyone lives happily ever after. This is not the case in this original tale of a boy who never grows up while everyone in the real world does. Heart breaking. Love this version, though. Everyone who is a fan of the movie, or who never wants to grow up should read this. I guarantee you wont after reading."
Peter Pan,0805072454,"J.M. Barrie, Michael Hague",Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"In a world full of weak, sappy and utterly meaningless books, sometimes it's nice to sit back with a cup of tea on a rainy day and crack open your grandfather's worn copy of Peter Pan. With its whimsical heroes and frightening villians, this book is more than just a thoughtful, exciting adventure.  It's a look into the Victorian world through a child's eyes.   Get past the mousiness of Wendy, the arrogance of Peter and the carefree exterior of the Lost Boys and you'll find a hauntingly beautiful tale about love and how precious a life is, no matter how short it may be. I highly recommend this book!"
Peter Pan,0805072454,"J.M. Barrie, Michael Hague",Barnes and Noble,4,healingmercy,"Peter Pan may be a children's book but I recommend it highly to anyone who feels like they need to get in touch with their imagination. Trust me, there is truth that lies in it for all ages."
"Pretties (Uglies, #2)",0689865392,Scott Westerfeld,Barnes and Noble,4.4,kels10,"Filled with fantasy, this book is amazing! Tally used to be an ugly but not anymore. Theres a new Tally now who is totally gorgeous and has the hottest boyfriend around. But when she finds out the truth about being pretty will she want to stay that way? I would recomend this book to pretty much anyone. You should especially read this if you're into fantasy. Once you start reading this you can't put it down. I loved this book, so i read the whole series. It uses lots of figurative language, and the author makes you feel as if you're part of the book. Mental images roll through your head the whole time you're reading it. Be sure to read the whole series: uglies,pretties,specials, and extras!"
"Pretties (Uglies, #2)",0689865392,Scott Westerfeld,Barnes and Noble,4.4,WordCandie,"I'm not Westerfeld's target demographic, but he writes complex and engrossing novels that appeal to me nonetheless. I loved watching Tally's character evolve in Pretties as she realized everything she'd hoped for turned out out not to meet her expectations following her experience with the Smokies. This story captures the conflict we all experience in adolescence between what we believe about the world and the realities of it. The exploration of a possible future dystopia is so well described that I feel as if I could purchase my own hoverboard and crash bracelets!"
"Pretties (Uglies, #2)",0689865392,Scott Westerfeld,Barnes and Noble,4.4,KaylaNicole_MusicLover,I found that Pretties was not as good as Uglies. I also found that it kind of drug on in parts. I also found I like David quite a bit more than I like Zane. Not that anyone reading really cares about my opinion. But that is what I think. Read it if you want more from the series. I just found it a bit disappointing.
Cloud Atlas,0375507256,David Mitchell,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"Cloud Atlas is difficult to describe.  It is hard to explain what the book is about, precisely.  It is a book about what makes a story, and it is a book about what it means to be human.  Ultimately, it is a book that forces the reader to question what is reality.  It is a postmodern tour de force, laden with literary allusions.  For example: Sonmi-451 is a clear reference to Bradbury's classic 'Fahrenheit 451', and her story parallels themes explored in '1984'.  Similarly, Zachry's tale of Sloosha's Crossin' is much like Russell Hoban's 'Riddley Walker'.  From Frobisher's letters, to Luisa's quest for truth... from Smith's journal and his final question at the end, 'Cloud Atlas' is a brilliant novel that intertwines stories and styles across centuries, continents, and cultures.  The stories are relatable and terrifying, and all speak volumes about human nature and its relationship to stories.  It is not a novel that you can say is 'about' something, in terms of plot.  It's far more thematic.  It's about humanity's relationship to one another, to stories, and its quest for truth and the definition of reality.  An excellent read that blew me away."
Cloud Atlas,0375507256,David Mitchell,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"Very rarely have I encountered  such  a masterpiece of storytelling.
Each of the six stories is complete , yet is so tightly interwoven into
the others that you simply can't put the book down. I can honestly say
that I would not recommend this book to anyone looking for a quick and
easy story. The allusions, the shifts in dialect, and the gallops across
time periods and cultures require a level attention that the casual
reader might find alarming.  However, if you're a deep thinker and you
want a book that  will make you examine your connection to the past,
present, and future, this is the book for you!"
Cloud Atlas,0375507256,David Mitchell,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"Don't be frightened off by reviews citing the book's 'experimental' nature. While not perfect, in 'Cloud Atlas' Mitchell moves seemlessly from voice to voice and finds a way to make six very different narratives almost equally engaging. Yes, there is a momentary sense of frustration when moving from one truncated section to the next (one even ends mid-sentence), but it's easy to get past this once sucked into the next thread. Mitchell drops enough breadcrumbs in the first half of the book to imply a reward for enduring the interuptions, and indeed he delivers on several levels: the literal linking of the narratives (whether they be manuscripts or sci-fi holographs), the philosophical/spiritual implications of reincarnation or distant relation, the unfortunate consistency of human oppression, and the dependence of all fiction (including history) on what has been created before. A tad of environmental preachiness here and there where the narrative itself would have sufficed evinced a few sighs here, but none of consequence. And some of the homages may be mistaken for derivative writing (Melville, Orwell and Huxley foremost), but in fact they form the basis for a more profound relation than that between the six narratives themselves, as 'Cloud Atlas' itself admits to being admits to being another legend drawn from legends. Mitchell has used a technique similar to that of Italo Calvino in 'If on a Winter's Night a Traveler' and pushed it beyond creative novelty. He infuses the novel with a rational, integrated plot structure that, beyond giving the reader a feeling that in the end it all 'makes sense,' itself adds a deeper layer of meaning."
The Things They Carried,0767902890,Tim O'Brien,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"The author, Tim O'Brien who is also the protagonist, begins his novel by describing an event that occurred in the middle of his war experience in Vietnam. In ""The Things They Carried"" Tim O'Brien describes what his fellow soldiers in the Alpha Company took with them on their missions both mentally and physically. Many things they brought with them are intangible, while others are physical objects, including matches, morphine, M-16 rifles, and M&M's which he seems to focus on the amounts of each of them.

Throughout the novel, he mentions many characters multiple times in various stories which are often partially true and meta-fiction. The first member of the Alpha Company to die is Ted Lavender,a low-ranking soldier who they refer to as a ""Grunt."" Lavender is a man who has found tranquilizers and marijuana the only way to relieve his anxiety and fix his problems. He is shot in the head on his way back from going to the bathroom, and when his leader, Lieutenant Jimmy Cross, finds out of his death he blames himself for Lavender's unnecessary and tragic death. When Lavender is shot, Cross is deep in his thoughts of his college crush, Martha. O'Brien writes about how Cross's ""love"" for Martha was the cause of Lavender's death and he still holds his guilt years after the war has ended. O'Brien continues on describing the events he was involved in, and then goes into each of them describing how his fellow comrades and sometimes himself reacts, and attempts to overcome them. He uses somewhat real stories to describe how tough it is for a man to be in a situation like what he was in, meta-fiction suggesting that no real story can describe what it was like. These problems that were presented to O'Brien and his fellow soldiers in the Vietnam War changed all of their lives. The war changed them to such a point that every day, every moment of their lives yet to come will never be like before the war. O'Brien tells of others and how they have attempted to overcome their problems which are the same or similar to his. He seems to attempt to use their methods in hopes that they will fix his problems and he will be able to return to his life before he was given no choice but to head to war. O'Brien was led into a room with no way out, he is stuck carrying what he was carrying at the end of his experience in Vietnam and he is striving to find a way to get it off of his shoulders and find a better mental state. This novel could be thought of as a way that Tim O'Brien used to share his thoughts and feelings of the war and his post traumatic stress disorder.

Overall, this is an excellent novel. It is a great ""thinker"" book and is not a typical easy read for a High School student like myself. It is very fun to read, but it is also very difficult to read which would be one, if not my only dislike of this book. This book would be great to read because it gives you an excellent point of view from a veterans perspective; this novel shows a true veteran and what it is like to be one. An overall rating of five stars, a great book that brings satisfaction and difficulty at the same time."
The Things They Carried,0767902890,Tim O'Brien,Barnes and Noble,4.2,mulligan,"I had to read this book for an Americna Literature Class during my undergraduate studies, and I loved it.  Tim O'Brien kept me wanting to come back for more.  The detail he uses describing the settings and events as they unfold will captivate you.  The litteral and figural things they carry are so well explained by O'Brien.  Deffinetly a must read for any Veteran or history lover."
The Things They Carried,0767902890,Tim O'Brien,Barnes and Noble,4.2,ChiliHead1987,"I read this book only because O'Brien was coming to my school to speak. I cannot be happier that this occurred! This book was nothing short of AMAZING, a truly remarkable read. The novel is essentially a series of interconnected short stories about a group of soldiers in Vietnam. My uncle was a Vietnam veteran, and he told me the book was about as good as they got when dealing with the subject matter (perhaps given to the fact O'Brien himself is a Vietnam veteran). I have encountered few books required by school that have made their way into my top-faves list. This one, I must say, is in at least spot three if not two. I cannot wait to read more by O'Brien and I hope he never stops writing!"
Wall and Piece,1844137872,Banksy,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"Realy creative and inspiring.  Even if you don't understand some of the art, it stirs you up in a delightful way!"
Wall and Piece,1844137872,Banksy,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"Banksy has all the answers for the bureaucrats.  The placement of his 'art' is extremely thought provoking. The accompanying titles and quotes are equally stimulating - sometimes very funny and sometimes very serious, but always making you think 'why didn't I think of that' or 'I know just what you mean'.  The humour can be nothing but British, there is no other like it. If you want something to stimulate your mind and make you do a double take, you must check out this 'wall art' book. This is one of the best books I've 'read' in a long time. Can't wait for more books like this."

"Pandemonium (Delirium, #2)",006197806X,Lauren Oliver,Barnes and Noble,4.5,lovepassionbooks,"FIRST OF ALL!!!  If you haven't read Delirium you must go and read it right now!  It is defiantly one of the best books I have ever read in my life.  And this book is not far from it.  I received this book from NCTE from Harper! Thank you so much.  I could not wait to read this book.  For the last couple weeks I have been told that I have to read it.  That it is amazing!  And boy is it ever.

The book starts where the first book finishes. The chapters are split in Now and Then. You are learning about Lena's experiences on finding herself. She is trying to figure out who she is because Lena is not the normal Lena anymore.  She is different because she has to be.  She is in the Wilds and she is trying to survive.  She is learning to do things that she has never done before to pull her weight with the Wilds.  I really like that Lauren incorporated this into the story.  It showed her struggle with what she had to do.  It showed that she was having a hard time dealing with the death of Alex.  

But during this you find out about Julian.  Julian is a very important.  He is about to be cured and he is doing it because this is what his family wants.  But there are some hold ups because Julian and Lena are kidnapped and held hostage.  They are going to do anything to get out and escape to the Wilds.  Oh but have no fear....there are twist and turns!  Boy are there twist and turns!

This is my favorite book of the series so far!  I know that we still have book three so I need to wait unit that book comes out to make my decision, but this is defiantly up there for book of the series!  Maybe book of the year....but ask me again in December...:)"
"Pandemonium (Delirium, #2)",006197806X,Lauren Oliver,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,If Lena picks Julian in the end over Alex Im pretty sure I break my nook in half or if she doesnt decide at all or falls in love with some other person randomly placed in her life I will break something. Pandemonium was good though so excited for next book!!!!

"Darkly Dreaming Dexter (Dexter, #1)",0307277887,Jeff Lindsay,Barnes and Noble,4.2,blake_taylor,"This book was an awesome read. A serial killer who only kills ""bad people"", what a concept, huh? and it makes for a great story. I saw the first two seasons of the series on showtime and loved it, so I decided to give the books a try. I picked this one up the other day at a local used book store and once i started reading it I couldnt put it down. I figured that since i still knew most of the plot line it wouldnt be as intriguing but it deffinitely was. finished it in about 3 days and thats fast for me because normally I'm doing all kinds of other things and just don't have as much time to read, but I made time for this book. Lindsay just pulls you in and engrosses you into the story. And I never thought i would be rooting for a serial killer not to get caught. I was also highly surprised to see that the 1st season of the show stuck pretty closely to the book. Of course they added some things and changed a couple things but all the basis was there and a lot was the same. This book was thrilling, exciting, funny,....it had it all. so if you are even considering this book. Give it a try..i don't think you will regret it."
"Darkly Dreaming Dexter (Dexter, #1)",0307277887,Jeff Lindsay,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"Having been introduced to the show before even knowing there was a literary basis for it, I had high hopes for this book. I was not disappointed. Lindsay does a superb job of engaging us with his now iconic anti-hero, making Dexter a fully realized human being who is charming and repulsive in almost equal measure. Though some reviewers have expressed a preference for the televised version, I think this book makes a solid companion piece that will fit nicely on the shelf of any fan of the series. I'd also urge anyone who enjoys the deliriously twisted world of Dexter to check out Crimson Orgy, a new novel by Austin Williams that blends dark humor and jolting suspense/horror to great effect."
"Darkly Dreaming Dexter (Dexter, #1)",0307277887,Jeff Lindsay,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Brian Dutkiewicz,I saw the tv series before reading the book. I could picture the cast acting out the scenes. Dexters narritive is sometimes to descriptive and lost me at some points. Overall a good quick read. Looking foward to the next book!
"The Dragon Reborn (Wheel of Time, #3)",0765305119,Robert Jordan,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"The Dragon Reborn is the third book of the Wheel of Time series by author Robert Jordan. After reading the book I was both very happy with some parts and somewhat disappointed with other parts. But overall The Dragon Reborn was a very good book. I strongly recommend reading the first two books of the series as to not be confused with what is happening in this book. Even having read the first two books readers will be confused and mislead until about the middle of this book because of the way Jordan puts everything together, but the book is more exciting for that reason because you never know what will happen next. As with all of his other books Robert Jordan puts a lot of detail into his book in terms of setting and characters, and this lets the reader delve deeper into the story itself. The Dragon Reborn is a continuation of Rand trying to fulfill prophesies of the Dragon, but he tries to do it alone and leaves his companions to try and track him down so he doesn't get himself killed. As with the previous two books this one is also a cross between The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter but it only has a few chapters that have anything to do with magic, while the rest of the book is fighting monsters and traveling. With the complexity of the book it is geared more towards a young adult to adult audience, and not recommended to a younger audience, first of all for its complexity but it also has some stronger language and scenes that are for the most part inappropriate for children. In all a great read that would make the reader want to continue on with the series until the end. The one bad part about this book is the abrupt ending.
	I would definitely recommend this book to any fantasy fan."
"The Dragon Reborn (Wheel of Time, #3)",0765305119,Robert Jordan,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"I loved this book.  It continues the sage well, but the ebook version here is frustrating.  The chapter functions (pages left in the chapter counters) never worked, and since the ebooks add so many ""pages"" to the reading experience it made figuring out whether or not to start a new chapter before going to bed harder for me than the e-versions of other books in this series that I have bought.  I realize that ebooks cost a bit more than paperbacks, but with that I expect all of the functionality of the ebooks I buy to be spot on.  This particular book was a bit glitchy as well (would often get stuck in certain pages and cause headaches for even continuing onto the next page in spots.  Very annoying).  Not the best ebook I have ever bought, but the story is great and I am excited to read the next in the series.  Hope the quality of the ebook is a bit more on par with books 1-2."

Gulliver's Travels,0141439491,"Jonathan Swift, Robert DeMaria Jr.",Barnes and Noble,3.4,AnnieBM,"Forget the cartoon versions of the Lilliputians and read the original. This collection of adventures from four voyages (Lilliput is only the first voyage.) builds in satire and its cutting edge right through the fourth voyage. Although written in such a different time, the book remains biting in wit and thought provoking. A most read for those interested in custom and culture, power and authority, and politics and economics in a shrinking world."
Gulliver's Travels,0141439491,"Jonathan Swift, Robert DeMaria Jr.",Barnes and Noble,3.4,Guest,"This is a geat classic story. Yes, some of the satire is lost to us now, but it makes wonderful statements about humanity that are still pertinent today. Truly wonderful!"
Gulliver's Travels,0141439491,"Jonathan Swift, Robert DeMaria Jr.",Barnes and Noble,3.4,Guest,"A work of incredible genius. Every section provides new insight into human folly and idiocy- and whether one is a Houhnymn or a Yahoo, Big -Ender or  Little-Ender one must delight at the human capacity to bring  the human down to its proper size. The brilliance of Swift is evident everywhere most poignantly perhaps in those creatures who go on living forever while continuing to physically and mentally age- perhaps modern medicine should have read this section.  A remarkable work but not especially for those who love mankind and wish to be optimistic about human life."

The basic plot of the play is ok (think of any romantic comedy, and you'll most likely think of something with an element similar to this), and it does have its entertaining bits, but really, only Shakespeare's wording and humor save it.  Don't get me wrong--Shakespeare is very humorous, and I was laughing at some of his writing ever since I was a kid--but something about combining the humor with a love story just doesn't entertain me.Maybe I just look for more action and less lovey-dovey stuff in my reading..."
Beowulf,0393320979,"Unknown, Seamus Heaney",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"From a town living in fear to a hero saving the day in less than a week, Beowulf was a novel of much action and excitement. This is a wonderful read and something that people will be reading for years to come and it will never lose its popularity because of the writing style and literature to remember. Beowulf is a story in which the town of Heorot is threatened by this horrible creature Grendel who wreaks havoc on innocent people when the sun goes down. Then this hero Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow, hears about the cries for help from Heorot and decides to rake up his men and drive their boat over there to defeat this malevolent villain. When they get to the town and spend a night there they hear Grendel in the castle. Through a battle between two opposing forces Beowulf defeats the hated monster so the town can live in peace. During this part of the book the author, Seamus Heaney, does a wonderful job of giving imagery of the fight so the reader can actually feel apart of what is going on and how Beowulf is feeling throughout all this. Heaney also does a good job of getting into the character's minds to show how they are feeling. Then when everyone thinks his or her hometown will be happy once again the mother of Grendel comes to avenge her son. Beowulf and the angered mother face an even more difficult battle when Beowulf emerges his powers and wins for Heorot once again, but this time beheading the hated Grendel as a trophy for the town to praise. I think this was the most important part of the book because it gave great peace to the town living in torture once and for all and everyone was granted the serenity of feeling safe. When Beowulf returns to his home of Geatland the people hear of his leadership and victory that they make him king when the old king Hygelac passes away. Beowulf made the land full of prosper and safety until he is old and faced with another challenge. A thief has come to his home of Geatland and hordes treasure protected by a frightening dragon. The rest of the book is just as amazing as the first parts and anyone would be wrong to not read this. In my opinion this book was highly entertaining. I also thought that for this being such an old book that it is impeccable to be so popular and liked that people are even wanting to read it in today's day and age of technology taking over."
Beowulf,0393320979,"Unknown, Seamus Heaney",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"Ok, as an English Lit. major in school, I've had my share of Beowulf, most of which are horridly translated drivel. The fine line with Anglo-Saxon poetry (and any translated poetry for that matter) is there requires a balance between fidelity to the text, and fidelity to the ideas of the text; that is to say, where literal translation may be more 'accurate' in a completely logical and scientific sense, the poetic beauty and proper notions behind the text must also be upheld.         Heaney finds the middle ground so commonly lost in modern translations. The Anglo-Saxon poetry of Beowulf is so beautiful and easy on the ears when read in the original Anglo-Saxon--a sense of bold and strong verse, but with the grace and beauty--reflected in Beowulf and especially in the Wurm. This is frequently translated into modern english as grossly (what I would call) 'harsh' and 'grating' verse, with all the punch that it requires, but without the languid fluiditiy required to fully appreciate the epic. Seamus Heaney finds the perfect balance between the two, not addressing the 'bone-crunching Beowulf' as a solely heartless character, but finding the section of the modern english language (that lost area right in the middle of form and function) and giving us this gift.        A MUST have for anyone wishing to appreicate the beauty of Germanic poetry. My recomendation: have someone read it aloud to you; it adds SO much to the experience!"
Beowulf,0393320979,"Unknown, Seamus Heaney",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Oneira,"In my class on Anglo-Saxon (the language), we basically translated this the whole semester. It wais such a hard class! I was one of two undergraduates, the rest were grad students. My biggest problem with the language is that it was never standardized. So even with a big Anglo-Saxon dictionary there's no telling if you'll find what you're looking for due to all the spelling variations. Anyway, I've read Beowulf (in Modern English) many times, starting in 8th grade advanced english. It is a great epic, originally pagan though there are interpolations from Christian editors. It gives one a really great glimpse at the society it depicts, and if you compare it to the archaeological evidence you a nearly complete picture. Highly reccomended for anyone who likes epic poetry, modern fantasy genre, and of course, pre-literate germanic and scandinavian peoples."

Batman: Year One,1401207529,"Frank Miller, David Mazzucchelli, Richmond Lewis, Dennis O'Neil",Barnes and Noble,4.5,eg180,"They should change the title to &quot;Jim Gordon: Year One.&quot;  I'm not going to say I didn't like it, it was a good read.  However, it's not like this is the &quot;definitive&quot; origin story or even the best one.  For starters, it's less than half about Batman.  It's told from the perspective of Bruce/Batman and Jim Gordon, but it seems to center more on Gordon than Batman.  Sure, you see Bruce coming back to Gotham and trying to be a vigilante, but it's patchy.  They go from him trying a simple disguise that doesn't work to deciding to become a bat through the usual means (one comes through his window) and, the next thing you know, he's Batman.  We see some of the stuff he does as Batman, but not a lot of it.  We mostly see him fight thugs and corrupt city officials.  We don't see him doing much investigation or even hunting down criminals.  He just pops up to do things and then goes away.  The rest of the book is a very in-depth telling of Jim Gordon's first year in Gotham.  He comes to Gotham after getting into some unspecified trouble in Chicago and then has to deal with a pregnant wife, corrupt cops and a lot of other stuff, including the Batman problem.  It just seems like the book is more about Gordon than it is Batman.  That's not really a problem, I like Jim Gordon's character.  However, the book shouldn't really be called &quot;Batman: Year One&quot; when it's hardly about Batman.  Most Batman books center solely around the title character, this is one of the few I've read that doesn't.  I just don't get people raving about this book like it's the ultimate origin story for Batman when that part of the plot is overshadowed by Jim Gordon's part of the plot."

Go Set a Watchman,0062409859,Harper Lee,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Anonymous,"What a shame she only wrote the two books. I enjoyed Watchman almost as much as Mockingbird. There are some suprises in store, but the characters are still vibrant, albiet slightly more human. She can make you laugh, cry and mad all at the same time. I found it well paced and easy to read. Scout is still Scout, and yes Atticus is still Atticus, having said this though I think the publisher was right, Mockingbird was superior and a better fit for the time."

When You Are Engulfed in Flames,0316143472,David Sedaris,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"Now, while I have heard a number of good things about David Sedaris' books, I have never actually read one before. Despite this, I was pretty excited about reading 'When You Are Engulfed in Flames', and I was not disappointed. Sedaris' newest book is a very funny collection of essays about ordinary everyday events in his life, or at least ordinary for him. All the stories in his book feel almost intertwined, possibly because they all to build up to a realization, almost like lessons he learned over time. Whether it is his realization that country spiders don't survive well in the city, or Sedaris eventually learning what makes one of his neighbors tick, Sedaris is very good at building a story over time. He can look at a number of events at different times and places, and see how he came to a better understanding because of these seemingly unrelated events. He also tends to make the simplest things seem more fun and exciting, such as quitting smoking. Not many people would decide to temporarily move across the world just to quit smoking. I think, in the end, David Sedaris is just skilled at comedy and story-telling in general. After all, isn't comedy just making the mundane amusing?"
When You Are Engulfed in Flames,0316143472,David Sedaris,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"Maybe because I've read all of his other books I found this one a little disappointing.  I only laughed out loud until I cried while reading one of the stories, while in the past much more frequently.  But I will still keep reading whatever he writes, as I do enjoy his skewed way of looking at life."
When You Are Engulfed in Flames,0316143472,David Sedaris,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"I love David Sedaris, but this book is a DISASTER. It's hard to believe that he's the author. There are few things worse than looking forward to a new book by a favorite author and instead being sold a pile of garbage. It's not funny, it's not insightful. This book reads like Sedaris gathered up all of the stories he'd thrown away over years of writing- the ones too awful for anyone else to see, and then had them published to see if any of us were dumb enough to read them."
"Daughter of Smoke & Bone (Daughter of Smoke & Bone, #1)",0316134023,Laini Taylor,Barnes and Noble,4.4,The_BookishType,"This is a rich, imaginative tale of magic and monsters, war and heartbreak. The world-building in this novel is breathtaking, the backstory a tapestry woven with strands of legend and otherworldly secrets. Laini Taylor's style is beautiful and intelligent, bewitching in its elegant flair. The pacing is perfect with never a dull moment, whether the intensity comes from the heat of battle, the awe of discovery or the mystery of Taylor's monsters.

Taylor's imagination knows no bounds. This is the most creative, original story I have ever read. Daughter of Smoke and Bone is a book that cannot be easily defined. It is a long history of war and senseless hate, otherworldly races and ancient magic. It is a fantasy and a tragedy and a romance. It is all these things and more. The descriptions are lush and vivid, the characters terrifying and oddly compelling, the lines between good and evil hopelessly blurred. It is a tale of self-discovery and irrepressible love, a coming-of-age story like no other.

Karou is such a compelling heroine, the kind of girl that shouldn't be crossed. She is quirky and mysterious -- from her naturally blue hair to her bullet-scarred belly -- a complex character who is alive and engaging from page one. Her mental life runs deep as she struggles with a lifelong sense of emptiness, and the constant frustration of vague answers from the only family she's ever known. Karou is smart and skilled, and she knows there's more to the story than she's been told. She is fearless when she needs to be, but vulnerable at heart. It's impossible not to fall in love with this one-of-a-kind heroine.

Her relationship with the chimaera who comprise her family is a complicated one -- full of loyalty and love, but also the betrayal and pain that plagues every family. Yet their deep-rooted bond is one of the most heart-warming aspects of the book, and is crucial to the impossible decisions Karou must make. Though they are repeatedly called ""monsters"" or ""devils"", Taylor takes care to show that nothing is so black and white. Karou's unconventional family fiercely loves her, and even when it's not always clear, they're acting with her best interest at heart.

A major part of what makes this tale so engrossing is the setting. Prague is a beautiful, enchanted place with cobblestone streets and macabre pubs -- anyone who reads this book will want to hop on a plane immediately. Taylor brings the scene alive for readers, making them feel the majesty of the city's beauty and the sting of the wind's sharp bite. Prague is timeless, full of hidden nooks and dusty secrets, the perfect setting for a tale of star-crossed love and forbidden magic.

Taylor perfectly balances drama and action with wit and passion, the kind of read that tickles the imagination and seeps into the soul. Readers will delight in the mystery of the devil's teeth, the brutal war between worlds and the truth of Karou's identity, never knowing where this colorful saga will take them next. Taylor's storytelling is stark and exquisite and lyrical, but also haunting, dark and sometimes tragic. When the many strands come together to reveal a stunning and heartbreaking truth, readers will never know what hit them. This is a fast-paced and high-soaring adventure that spans continents and worlds, generations and families -- but ultimately it all comes down to one girl, one special, strange girl with a secret sadness and a forgotten past.

~Review from the"
"Daughter of Smoke & Bone (Daughter of Smoke & Bone, #1)",0316134023,Laini Taylor,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Shanella,"I'm at a lost to describe this book. Is it a fairy tale? A twist to the old Romeo and Juliet story? A tale of war? A tale of prejudice? It's all of these things and more.

Karou is an artist whose imagination creates the wonderful hybrid creatures on the pages of her art-book - which is popular among the other art students at her school in Prague. The creatures are so realistic and Karou even has stories about them, telling it all with the wry smile that hides the fact that her imaginative creations and fantastic stories are real. 

I was transported. 

Laini's descriptive writing style printed such an impressive image of Prague in my head that I'm ready to call a travel agent and book my flight. If only Brimstone's shop could be reached via plane. 

I was enthralled. 

Karou, Zuzana, Issa, Twiga, Yasri, Brimstone and the rest, leaped out of the pages. Laini's characters are so well developed that I can picture them, right now, almost as if they are crowding my room, vying for my attention. The story was constantly moving, shifting, twisting; but never overwhelming or dull. I practically devoured it. 

I was mystified. 

One of the best parts of this story was the reveal in the end. In the back of my mind I knew what was happening, I knew where the story was going - because of the clues that were hidden along the way - but it wasn't until the reveal that everything became clear. I love when authors can achieve that balance, giving just enough for you to think you've got it, but leaving just enough out for you to be surprised in the end. This was the case with Daughter of Smoke and Bone. It was a perfect blend of romance, adventure, and suspense. I cannot wait to read more from Laini!"
"Daughter of Smoke & Bone (Daughter of Smoke & Bone, #1)",0316134023,Laini Taylor,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Saint_Trinity,"This book was amazing! I've been kind of wary of the fantasy genre lately, because most stories are stereotypical and redundant. But the cover caught my eye, so I decided to check it out. And I was not disappointed. While the basic idea of an angel and demon falling in love is nothing new, Taylor wrote it in the way it always should have been: dark, intriguing, complex, and unique. The plot had plenty of twists and turns without being overly confusing. The setting was clear and distinctive. 
But the best part were the characters. Karou is what every teenage girl wants to be: witty, mysterious, dangerous, and lovely, without being too perfect. Brimstone and the other demons so embody what you want them to be that you can practically see them, sitting in your living room and drinking coffee. While Akiva is described as beautiful, he's not even close to a sparkle fairy. Instead, he's got enough of the avenging angel aspect to be formidable. 
I would definitely recommend this story for anyone who's fed up of the average fantasy/paranormal romance but isn't ready to give up hope on the genre."
The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business,1400069289,Charles Duhigg,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Ronrose,"My usual habit is to pick up a mystery novel and engross myself in the imagined problems of nonfiction characters. I decided to change this habit and try this nonfiction book with the rather intriguing title that professed to help identify our habits and show us how to change them. Habits are those things we initially choose to do, which have evolved, through repeated use into things we do without thinking. Written in language even I can understand, the book breaks down the pattern of habits into three parts that we can recognize and change. The author illustrates that by first identifying components of a habit, we can then work to change them. This is a self help book that may actually be of some help, if we want to change. This book was provided for review by Random House. Now, where did I put that mystery novel?"
The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business,1400069289,Charles Duhigg,Barnes and Noble,4.1,EthanJonesMBA,"In this wonderful book, Charles Duhigg, an investigative reporter for The New York Times, tackles an important reality head on. That is, people succeed when they identify patterns that shape their lives--and learn how to change them. This idea--that you can indeed change your habits--draws on recent research in experimental psychology, neurology, and applied psychology. My chief complaint is he doesn't really show you how to break bad habits. For this you should consider Emotional Intelligence 2.0. That book was great for my self-control. As you can see from the TOC below, Duhigg really goes after a broad range of topics. He looks at the habits of individuals, how habits operate in the brain, how companies use them, and how retailers use habits to manipulate buying habits. This provides some fascinating research and stories, such as the fact that grocery stores put fruits and vegetables at the front of the store because people who put these healthy items in their carts are more apt to buy junk food as well before they leave the store. The author's main contention is that ""you have the freedom and responsibility"" to remake your habits. He says ""the most addicted alcoholics can become sober. The most dysfunctional companies can transform themselves. A high school dropout can become a successful manager."" He makes a convincing case for all this. The only problem is that's all he does. He doesn't show you how to do it. PART ONE: THE HABITS OF INDIVIDUALS 1. The Habit Loop - How Habits Work 2. The Craving Brain - How to Create New Habits 3.

It was so boring to read story after story with the same diagrams over and over. Just wasn't what I expected."
Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,0679751521,John Berendt,Barnes and Noble,4.1,slimikin,"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is a splendid piece of nonfiction. Part true crime, part Savannah guidebook, it reaches beyond both of these to become a captivating character study. John Berendt effortlessly captures the voices of both the people he meets and the city of Savannah, itself. And yet, though his impressions and experiences shape the narrative, he remains an understated presence in the book, offering what he sees and hears with minimal commentary, and leaving us, the readers, with the sense that it is we who are in fact meeting these people and this place. As their new acquaintances, moreover, we're free and welcome to come to our own conclusions about the quality of their characters, and so we, too, become drawn into the book's singular series of events. Deftly rendered with elegant and evocative prose, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is a funny, insightful, and often touching glimpse into Savannah's charming, mysterious heart."
Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,0679751521,John Berendt,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,I loved this book! The chareacters and plot are very original and catching. I think that way the book is written draws you in and makes you want to keep reading and the way he describes Savannah makes you want to move there or at lease visit. The characters are all colorful and you love them. This is a good book for someone who likes mystery and comedy.
Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,0679751521,John Berendt,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"In the book every moment seems to lead up to main plot. The book is very organized and easy to read. The characters in the book are very different than normal characters and it is what captures your interest to start with. My favorite character would have to be Chablis, just because of her attitude and personality. In the town of Savannah, it would be very peaceful and I believe that the author portraid the town very well. It's easy to picture in your mind, even if you don't have a creative imagination. The ending was well rounded, but it possibly could have added what every one was doing in the end of the book."
A Little Princess,0142437018,"Frances Hodgson Burnett, Nancy Bond",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,I felt like this book should never end. Im 8 years old and im in 3rd grade. I felt very sad when sara crewe's father died. This book is the best book even though i didnt read it on my nook. Thank you for reading my review.
A Little Princess,0142437018,"Frances Hodgson Burnett, Nancy Bond",Barnes and Noble,4.4,CheesyPrincess,"A Little Princess, originally written by Frances Hodgson Burnett about a century ago is a classic, that girls of all ages will simply adore. A Little Princess tells the story of young, clever Sara Crewe, who arrives in England with her father from India, in order to attend Miss Minchin's School for Girls, which is a boarding school. At the school, Sara is richer than all the other girls and her room is filled with finery the other girls don't have. She even has her own maid, Mariette! She also becomes the smartest girl in school, which causes another girl, Lavinia Herbert, to hate Sara out of jealousy. But instead of being spoiled or bragging about her smarts, Sara compliments others on their own talents and strengths, and is not spoiled at all, but nice, and tries to help others in need. Sara even befriends a poor fourteen-year old scullery maid, Becky, and sara also tels stories to the other girls. She wins many friends, and soon the whole school, including mean, cranky Miss Minchin are calling Sara ""princess"". Soon, four years pass by at the school, and Sara is now ce;ebrating her eleventh birthday. But before the celebrating can begin, Miss Minchin is called to her office. Miss Minchin learns that Sara's father has died and he hadn't left any money to Sara, because he had lost all his money. Furious on everything she had spent for Sara's sake, Miss Minchin cacels the party and forces Sara to dress in rags and become a scullery maid, like Becky, nad luve in the attic. Sara now has to work very hard, and is very lonely. But when it seemed like Sara had lost everything, an unexpected twist of events come up, and Sara finds true happiness at last. I think this is an educational and entertaining classic for girls, since we can relate to it so well. Any girl out there who is looking for a classic to read, I highly recommend A Little Princess. It certainly deserves five stars! Thank you Frances Hodgson Burnett for such a wonderful and inspiring tale!"

The Truth About Forever,0142406252,Sarah Dessen,Barnes and Noble,4.7,readtolive_livetoread,"Sarah Dessen is a good writer, creating believable and relatable characters that very adequately reflect what teens are like. My favorite part of the books I've read by her is the dialogue, which, if you examine carefully, is unique to whichever character she's writing about. Sarah creates well-rounded characters. And it's probably her biggest skill.
Macy Queen is quite a confused young woman. Her father died, and grief-stricken Macy keeps blaming herself. Worse, she comes to think that if she can just keep things at a constant, that is, perfectly still, she can control her life. And that's her biggest flaw: this unfailing faith in perfection that she simply won't snap out of.
Enter Wes and the whole Wish Catering crew. They help Macy come to life-altering realizations about the controlled forever she keeps thinking she can attain. Wes, especially, helps her see that the future--the eventual forever--is about changes and imperfections and learning from your mistakes, not a present that moves forward with time, never changing.
The story had a nice message. It was well written. The characters--Wes, in particular--were for the most part great. I don't know how else to elaborate on it, because, to me, this book speaks for itself."

"Last Sacrifice (Vampire Academy, #6)",1595143068,Richelle Mead,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Katie26,"As far as I know, this is the summary for this book: ""Murder. Love. Jealousy. And the ultimate sacrifice. Now, with Rose on trial for her life and Lissa first in line for the Royal Throne, nothing will ever be the same between them.""

I can't wait for it to come out! I like Adrian as a character, but I am not sure that I like him with Rose. Dimitri obviously still loves her, but then again, Adrian does too. I just hope that this series doesn't turn out like the House of Night books where the girl has like four boyfriends. I hope she chooses one, and I hope it's Dimitri. He and her had planned a life together and they need to live it. I don't think it could ever work between her and Adrian, sorry to say.

I also am really curious about who killed Tatiana. I reread Spirit Bound like, five times and couldn't figure it out. It couldn't have been Victor Dashkov because there is no way he could get into Court to do it. But then it had to be someone close to Rose to be able to take her stake. I was sort of thinking Ambrose, but I also don't think that it was him. I just can't wait for Last Sacrifice! There was such a big cliff hanger and unresolved questions and emotions. This series is so amazing and I just want to keep rereading them!"

It took me about 4 days to read them all, I couldn't put them down! Richelle Mead is an awesome writer, and the books kept me up night after night! Rose is the a badass who knows how to handle herself and I love that about her. I want Rose to find out who really murdered the queen and kick their ass for framing her! I am counting down the months until The Last Sacrifice comes out, although it will be a bitter sweet moment, because it is the last in the series!"

A classic series, that is unforgettable!  I remember reading this series when I was about 8 or 9 years old.....I didnt put the books down until I was completley finished with the entire series and as soon as I was done reading them, I started all over again.  Now that I am an adult, I am finding myself buying the series again and cant wait to open the first book, and continue reading until the 9th book is finished.  Once I am done with that, I am going to start reading the series with my 8 year old twin daughters.  Cant wait to get started!!!!"

"Little House on the Prairie (Little House, #2)",0064400026,"Laura Ingalls Wilder, Garth Williams",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"Roughing it out on the wide open prairie. The title of the book is Little House on the Prairie, and the author is  Laura Ingalls Wilder. There are many major characters in the book, Pa, Ma, Mary, Laura, and baby Carrie. Pa is also known as Charles he, is the father of the family and Ma also known as Caroline, is the mother. The oldest child is Mary, the second oldest is Laura and the youngest is baby Carrie. The family is heading south, during the colonial period. They end up staying on a dry prairie which just happens to have wolves near by. After they find out there are wolves they find out there are Indians near by also. Will the wolves attack or will the Indians invade, who knows?		My first impression of this book was, ¿Oh it will be ok,¿ but, now that I have started reading the book, I think it is rather interesting. The book is exciting and wonderful. I liked the book because it is so lively and vibrant, with lots of details. For example, Laura Ingalls Wilder described the prairie to have tall, long, dry, grass. And a wide blue sky with no clouds in site, just a blazing sun over the prairie. 				I would recommend this book to anyone that likes the colonial period. The author uses great transitioning words, which makes the book flow really well. She has inspired me with her writing. For example she would not say the bird is blue. She would say the little bird is a shaded of blue, and in the far away distance you can hear the sweet song echoing over the hills and valleys. If you are into  long detailed books this is not the book for you!"

Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry Into Values,0060589469,Robert M. Pirsig,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,"The first of Robert Maynard Pirsig's two books, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is neither primarily focused on zen nor motorcycle maintenance but is a nonfiction account of the author's search for truth.  More symbolic of the manifestation of Pirsig's philosophies, the concepts of zen and motorcycles are used to demonstrate the author's theories so that the reader can better visualize his ideas.      Serving as the book's main organizational device, the motorcycle trip lasts for seventeen days beginning in Minnesota and ending in California.  This quest motif seems to be representative of the author's larger search for truth, for identity, and for quality.      Interspersed throughout the story of the author's journey through the mountains are what he likes to call Chautauquas:  philosophical thoughts pertaining to life, human nature, humanity's relationship with technology, and the ever-elusive concept of quality, which is the book's main focus.  The philosophical aspects make the book worth your time and somehow more sophisticated.  The narrative aspects provides interest and gives you a break from all the deep concepts presented.  The autobiographical aspects cause a relationship between the author and yourself to form.    Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance can be a perplexing book and a struggle to get through.  In the beginning of the book, before you've adjusted to this unusual style of the author, you can't help but wonder as what this book's purpose is, be confused at this structure which you had never seen before, and even question the sanity of the author.     Then, as a reader you become accustomed to Pirsig's writing style.  You begin to look at things differently, where you don't look so much as to what the words are but what they mean.  And after becoming accustomed to his unusual style, you learn to appreciate it.  His use of narrative structure makes it seem as if the author is just now experiencing all of these thoughts and discovering all of these truths.  Pirsig portrays himself to be in the act of philosophizing, in the act of his experiential struggles, not simply telling the reader afterward when the action is finished and the thought has ceased.  As a reader, you feel as if you are experiencing these revelations in concurrence with him.      Pirsig invites you to step into the next level of thinking but still allows you to formulate your own personal viewpoints and opinions.  He doesn't write above the level of the average person, yet manages to not oversimplify things as if he's addressing ignorance.      Before reading this book, I perceived the concepts which he discusses to be way above my level, perhaps because they simply are too complex for me or perhaps because I lack the patience to really sit down and examine them.  Somehow, Pirsig made these topics more understandable.  However, this is not to be confused with effortless.  He does not make the topics easy and simple, but he makes them more accessible to an ordinary person like myself.  He allows you to have the opportunity to look at and dissect these things, to relate them to your own thoughts and life, to have its own profound impact on you.      There is still much confusion, times of frustration, endless hours of thinking about these concepts that just go around and around in your mind.  There is still all of this, but there is no confusion as to what these topics are, just the marvelous confusion of what these topics mean.  Personally, my perception of the theme was that changing your concept of the world and of life can change the world and life itself.  Looking at things from a different point of view, a point of view not tainted by sociey's perception of right and wrong and normal, a point of view not tarnished by structure and routine, a point of view completely new and fresh, can do wonders.      Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is the type of book that stays with you long after you've finished reading it."

Lots of motorcycle talk & the phaedrus part is confusing, but by the end of the book, I felt that the author took me on a philosophical journey that was worth the effort.  It made me contemplate why our society believes so much in science & evidence & how art is separate.  In the end he defines quality as ¿doing one¿s best¿ & he proposes that it can be measured."
The War of the Worlds,0375759239,"H.G. Wells, Arthur C. Clarke",Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"This book is a work of art. The descriptions of the Martians and the battle for survival of the human created by H.G. Wells is exciting and worth reading. The narrator's journey to reeunite with his wife in the mist of the Martians arrival on Earth is extremely interesting to read. Also, the Martians themselves are new and different than anything that most have heard, or read, of before. The only downside of this wonderful novel is the author of the endnotes. He gives away the ending of the book in the first few endnotes, and I would've rather found out for myself the ending at the end of the book. Other than that, it is a must-read for any sci-fi fan."

"Pretty Little Liars (Pretty Little Liars, #1)",0060887303,Sara Shepard,Barnes and Noble,4.5,AJourneyOfBooks,"Often described as a mix between I Know What You Did Last Summer and Desperate Housewives PRETTY LITTLE LIARS by Sara Shepard promised to be an exciting and suspenseful read.  Sure enough, it met and exceeded all of my expectations.  

The first thing that I will say about this book is that I was really expecting something a little more superficial and juvenile.  I had never read anything by Ms. Shepard before, so I didn't know what to expect.  What I received was a book that would be great for any teen and most adults I know.  Ms. Shepard's writing is far from juvenile and made for a story that had me hooked from the first few lines.  

Sounds good right?  Girl goes missing and eventually her friends get on with their lives.  Well, if this were the end of the story, the book would be about seven pages long. No, Ms. Shepard isn't going to let you off that easily.  Tossed into the chaos right from the beginning of the book, the girls each separately start to receive mysterious text messages signed by ""A"".  As they attempt to figure out who ""A"" is, the messages get more and more disturbing, some hinting at secrets that only the missing Allison knew.

Cue the suspenseful music!

So really though, if I could have had a suspense soundtrack playing while I read this book, I'm fairly certain that I would have jumped out of my seat in shock a few times.  This was a beautifully crafted book with a well thought out plot line that easily hooks readers and then draws them in.  The complexity of the story was what really made this a great read and I can't imagine the amount of time and planning that went into crafting the various plot twists and turns that pop up throughout the pages.  Think you know something about someone?  I can pretty much guarantee that by the next page you'll be proven wrong.  When everyone is suspect, who can you trust?  Ms. Shepard answers that one for us - nobody.

One part of PRETTY LITTLE LIARS that may trip a few people up are the varying points of view throughout the story.  Each chapter is really told from a different girl's point of view although they all aren't necessarily labeled by girl.  Still, I found it fairly easy to figure out who's chapter we were in and didn't really notice too much of a disconnect between the four stories when reading.  Ms. Shepard does an amazing job with her consistency; although each girl's chapter takes place in different places and settings, they tie together well and occasionally we even see just a little bit of overlap.  

The last part of the book that I briefly need to discuss is the character development.  In a book like this, especially for the first in a series, character development is vital to a successful story.  Ms. Shepard did this wonderfully.  My proof is in the way that the characters, Spencer especially, still roam through my mind, picking at my brain when I have little else to do.

I highly recommend PRETTY LITTLE LIARS to any fans of drama or YA fiction out there.  Looking for a good thriller?  I would definitely point to this book.  Although filled with topics that young adults can relate to, I don't see much here that would turn an adult off from the book.  Indeed, I think adults too will very much appreciate the adrenaline rush this book provides."
"Pretty Little Liars (Pretty Little Liars, #1)",0060887303,Sara Shepard,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"Holy cow! These book covers are so misleading. When I first saw this book I thought it was some sort of rich-girl-i-wear-prada-and-get-my-nails-done-everyday kind of book. But like I said the covers are so misleading. The phrase ""don't judge a book by it's cover"" totally applies here. If you haven't read this book you need to. It is such a page turner. I finished this particular book in one night because i couldnt put it down. Well I can't make you read the book but i can make you want to so hopefully that convinced you.

The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals,1594200823,Michael Pollan,Barnes and Noble,4.3,SweetbriarPoet on LibraryThing,"Books that make you take a look at what society is truly doing behind the scenes always make me nervous. I'm not proud to admit it, but, even though I read a lot of sociology, politics, and history, there are some things which inherently make me nervous. Food culture is one of them. This book is truly important. It might not change your view about what you are eating, but it will inform you of the consequences of each decision. I didn't find the book preachy or overdone; I found it stimulating. However, the section on industrial agriculture made me wonder how things got so bad politically. I mean, I guess I know how they did. I just hope that Michael Pollan is right...maybe we are moving in a more transparent direction, in which we start understanding our relationship with nature is extremely complex. Maybe we will admit our ignorance and move towards an more sustainable and healthy future."
The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals,1594200823,Michael Pollan,Barnes and Noble,4.3,TheTwoDs on LibraryThing,"I guess the sure sign of my feelings on this book are that immediately after completing it, I went to my local farmers' market and purchased a bunch of fresh produce which I then proceeded to use in my home cooked meals this week.  However, I also am aware of the paradox - I was only able to make such fine (in the surprised words of my wife) meals because I was off from work and had the time to make broiled shark steak with fresh local corn, carrots and string beans; pork chops with local cherry and onion sauce with sauteed local zucchini and toasted almonds; and veal sausage with local peppers, onions and garlic with a salad of local lettuces, tomatoes, cucumbers and scallions.  Hungry yet?  That's how I felt after reading this book.  I knew about the horrors of industrial farming, particularly with regards to meat, but the history of how we became so fixated on corn and what it has meant for our diets and the environment was truly compelling.  Needless to say, the grass farmer section and the foraging section made me wish I could partake in such a lifestyle."

Life After Life,0316176486,Kate Atkinson,Barnes and Noble,3.6,lovelybookshelf,"When I first read the synopsis of Kate Atkinson's Life After Life, I immediately wondered how Ursula Todd would come back to life. Would it be like Captain Jack Harkness in the television series Torchwood, where moments after death she'd revive with a huge gasp for air? Would it be more like the movie Groundhog Day, with all the frustration that came with not being able to escape the loop? Would she be aware of what was happening? Would other people be aware of it happening to her? No matter how many possibilities I envisioned, I was still surprised by the way Kate Atkinson crafted this plot point. It is handled with ingenuity and originality; never cheesy, never trite. I'm purposely being vague here, because I don't want to spoil it for anyone. But I think every time I feel d&eacute;j&agrave; vu in the future, I'll be reminded of this novel...

Much of the story took place in London during the bombings (the &quot;Blitz&quot;) of WWII. These pages were terrifying and heart-wrenching. I would start to feel overwhelmed and think, &quot;Is this ever going to stop?&quot; I'd want to put the book down for a while, and then feel guilty. I'd been reading over the course of only two days, and could take a break whenever I wanted. London had 57 nights in a row of bombings. Atkinson gives readers an incredibly vivid portrayal of war, a poignant and multifaceted look at its enormity and how distressing - and wearying - it is for all involved.

Life After Life is beautifully written and reads like a classic. Wonderfully complex, it's a story you could read over and over and always make new connections.

I received a copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. I did not receive any other compensation for this review."
Life After Life,0316176486,Kate Atkinson,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Shudro,"I received an ARC of Kate Atkinson's latest book and was not disappointed! Kate wields Ursula's life and her various possibilities like a kaleidoscope; with one simple twist the results are so beautifully different and complex.

From the publisher, &quot;On a cold and snowy night in 1910, Ursula Todd is born, the third child of a wealthy English banker and his wife. Sadly, she dies before she can draw her first breath. On that same cold and snowy night, Ursula Todd is born, lets out a lusty wail, and embarks upon a life that will be, to say the least, unusual. For as she grows, she also dies, repeatedly, in any number of ways. Clearly history (and Kate Atkinson) have plans for her: In Ursula rests nothing less than the fate of civilization.&quot;

Facing the unknown, reincarnation and ownership for our actions or passivity is a fascinating backdrop to this wildly powerful tale that courses through different time periods in England and Europe's 20th century. It was so easy to be caught up in Ursula's many lives; I got the same rush of excitement and anticipation as I did when reading the &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&rdquo; book series in the 80&rsquo;s as a young girl! I highly recommend &ldquo;Life After Life&rdquo;, as it was thoroughly engaging and engrossing &ndash; which is the marking of a phenomenal book!"
Life After Life,0316176486,Kate Atkinson,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Anonymous,"This was a selection for our book club, and I have to say it isn't one I would have picked myself, nor would I read it again.  The premise is very intriguing and the history and writing are well done.  The explanation of the ""deja vu"" and how Ursula moves past a previous obstacle each time she starts over were very well done. However, about halfway through, the story just became mundane, and while a lot of it lended to the history of the time period Ursula lived in, I felt that the more important parts of the plot were lost in boring daily detail. It also became a little jumbled at the end, and i'm not quite sure i really understand what happened or why it happened in the end after all.  If you just want ot give something different a try, a chance to read outside the box, give it a shot. But dont expect a riveting story."
The Rescue,0446696129,Nicholas Sparks,Barnes and Noble,4.4,ilovechar,"WOW! This would have to be one of the best books I've read in awhile. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the author or is just looking for a fantastic book, which keeps you on your toes.  picked it up every free second I had. Once again Nicholas Sparks keeps on pleasing his readers.This novel includes all of his writing trademarks, secretive pasts, a new love, tragedy, and a pleasing but shocking end. One day Denise and her speaking impaired son Kyle were in a tragic accident. Then Taylor, a volunteer fireman came along Denise and rescues Kyle. After some time together, they both have to face their pasts in order to make their love for each other to work out. Taylor tries to overcome the guilt of the tragic losses of two important people in his life and learning how to love and stay committed to a woman. Denise learns to let go of her wounded pasts and fears of her mother, Kyle's dad, Kyle, and letting someone get close to him.So in my opinion, from the ones I've read, The Rescue would be one of the best books Nicholas Sparks has written.

The Rescue,0446696129,Nicholas Sparks,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"This coming from a military man, who normally reads macho type books, this book was excellent.  I am thankful for the switch.  After reading The Notebook, I thought I had a new favorite book, til this one.  A good book for everyone to read!"
"Voyager (Outlander, #3)",0385335997,Diana Gabaldon,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"While working at a bookstore, I decided that I needed to read one sci-fi and one romance novel just to get a feel for the genre. I selected Diana Gabaldon's ""Outlander"" for the romance novel, and was absolutely captivated by her story and style. I devoured the first three books in less than six weeks--an amazing feat for me as a slow reader with sight impairments--and have started at least 200 people on these books since then. I have had exactly two negative reactions.Voyager, as I said above, is my favorite of all the books so far. In the last 300 pages or so, Gabaldon's plot moves at breathtaking speed, tying up many ends. The conclusion is stunning. In a year when real time/distance travel is curtailed by high gasoline prices, the ""Outlander"" series--and ""Voyager"" in particular--is a mental escape of the first order. If you need some place to go on your ""staycation,"" I would strongly suggest Scotland in the mid-1700's, and a visit with Jamie and Clare Fraser. You won't be disappointed."
"Voyager (Outlander, #3)",0385335997,Diana Gabaldon,Barnes and Noble,4.5,pagese,"At the start of this book, I was afraid it wasn't going to live up to the first two. It took me awhile to figure out why I wasn't liking it as much. While I enjoyed learning about Jamie and Claire after they were separated, it's the two of them together that make this series so special. And then I realized that story of their 20 years apart is important too. As a reader we need to understand how much of an influence they had on one another. That even after 20 years (not to mention 2 centuries), they still hold those outstanding feelings for each other. But, I have to admit, that moment in the print shop was what I was waiting for! This book takes you on a ride. It's not stop action with all that heart stopping romance in between. It's suspenseful, and at times I really wondered if Jamie and/or Claire was going to get out of whatever situation they managed to find themselves in. It had some major shocks and twists in it, things that I was down right not expecting. And, at times I wondered if 20 years of separation was just too much to overcome. At the end of the story, I was left with a book that rivals my first love of Outlander! I was amazed at the story Diana Gabaldon has managed to create."
"Voyager (Outlander, #3)",0385335997,Diana Gabaldon,Barnes and Noble,4.5,SassaFrass2044,"Voyager was just as addictive as the first two in the Outlander series!  Not as totally indulgent as Outlander....but then again...there's nothing like the first...is there?  With that being said, I was completely satisfied with the plot and the further development of the characters.  She kept the main characters true and human.  I also liked how Gabaldon decided to write about the 20 years in past tense versus taking us through the entire 20 years. Liked all of the new characters.  There was still lots of adventure....although I noticed she lessened with the sex scenes; which I thought was appropriate.  It made the few so much more enduring! Also, even though the characters are 20 years older their passions are just as true...which is true to life.  I could honestly stop reading here (hah! fat chance) because of how Voyager ended.  Although I must say a lot will have to do with the fact that I am totally sleep deprived and on the verge of a divorce (hehehe....slightly compulsive).  My husband keeps saying ""I can't believe I have 3 more books to go!"" However, it's Christmas and if you can't read at Christmas when can you?  I've started my husband on the 2nd book in the series and he is thoroughly hooked - job done!  I will definitely be packing the light blue book for my road trip! Voyager is a great read!"

The Virgin Suicides,0747560595,Jeffrey Eugenides,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"I say first, Eugenides is a great storyteller. Well written, draws you in, descriptive. But this  is not a great story. These boys aren't realistic, holding hands, fretting about the neighbor girls, stealing their stuff (makeup? Shoes?) to idolize it. Weird boys worshipping weirder girls for no apparent reason other than they have to to make the book go. Nothing gets resolved but luckily there wasnt a big mystery to begin with so i didnt care. I felt depressed by the end--i'm not looking for happy endings when i read, but also not looking for anticlimactic absence of caring. I'd read another book from him, but their stoylines seem like real downers too, so no thanks."
"Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging (Confessions of Georgia Nicolson, #1)",0060288140,Louise Rennison,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"Angus, Thongs, and Full Frontal Snogging is the diary of 14 year old Georgia Nicolson and her adventures throughout a full year. You are introduced to her younger sister Libby, wild cat Angus, best friend Jes, first boyfriend the professional snogger, and her one true love Robbie. Before school starts Georgia begins experimenting with makeup and decides that her eyebrows are the problem. She shaves her eyebrows off. These are the kind of problems deals with all year. Life is hard enough without eyebrows but after they grow back the boy problems start.     When I started reading this book I noticed that I would be flipping page after page and not even thinking about it. Before I knew it the book was over. I made the mistake of starting the book during 3rd period English which would have been fine but I couldn't put it down until lunch. I guess I will never know what happened during History and French on that day. Not only was Angus, Thongs, and Full Frontal Snogging  easy to read it was extemely enjoyable. I would be reading during class or during rehersal and literally laugh out loud. Angus was one of those character that made me laugh. Can you imagine a wild cat that is bigger than a poodle and who loves to frighten the neighbor's dog?    The writing style of Louise Rennison is witty and conversational. When I was reading this book I would actually be reading it in my head in a british accent. I think everyone can relate to Georgia. This book isn't a fairy tale made up of unbelieveable plots and happily ever after. Georgia is real, she often says how much she hates her life and I don't know a teenager who doesn't think that every other week. When reading this book I would think to myself I know how that feels. I truely believe that most teenage girls can find a new favorite book in Angus, Thongs, and Full Frontal Snogging."
"Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging (Confessions of Georgia Nicolson, #1)",0060288140,Louise Rennison,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"I never believe when somone says that a book is a laugh out loud book, but this one really was. I had to make sure I read it only in certain places because I was laughing out loud. I'm in my early 20's and I can't put it down. I remember all those awkward situations. this book is one of the funniest things I have ever read."
"Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging (Confessions of Georgia Nicolson, #1)",0060288140,Louise Rennison,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Dani_Burrage,"Angus, Thongs and Full Frontal Snogging, Louise Rennison's laugh out loud novel, follows the ups and downs of a British teen's experience growing up through her every day journal entries. Like most of us, Georgia has a goal. And that goal is to meet the man of her dreams and live to be fabbity fab fab. Too bad nothing can be fabulous in Georgia's life. 

To start off, she is missing her eyebrows thanks to a shaving accident. And that only accentuates her much too large nose. And she cannot manage to have a large nose because she has to impress her crush The Sex God and steal him away from his wet girlfriend. And to top things off she has to live with a cat the size of a Labrador, the Olds (A.K.A her parents) and her little sister who is far from the average kindergartener. Georgia's life is not hard. It's pure entertainment. 

Teenage girls will die laughing over Georiga's tell all diary, whether it be she is whining about her miserable love life or the fact that her best friend thinks she looks like an alien. No matter what something is happening to Georgia. Ninety percent of the time it is not pleasant. 

Unlike most teen books, which center on friendship and all the great things about growing up, Louise Rennison writes to make readers laugh. And the miserably embarrassing parts of high school are always the funniest; at least to other people. That's why Rennision decided to write Georgia's life based off her own teen experiences. In fact, most of the bizarre characters and happenings in the novel aren't one hundred percent fictional. 

Though Rennison does a great job depicting teenage woes, actual plot and morals get lost in the humor and randomness. The only thing the reader learns by the end of the book that there was really no story to tell besides the fact that Georgia is hilariously funny.  

That's what makes this novel the perfect relaxed read for girls. There aren't any big or fancy words and the closest thing to thinking required is deciphering some of the British slang terms that come up here and there. And best of all, Rennison was sure to leave out any adult sounding preaching. 

Rennison's writing is true to life, the good parts and the bad ones. She never condones teen girls making out or smoking cigarettes. Rather, she finds the humor in it and gives the reader a glimpse of how silly teenage worries and ""struggles"" really can be. 

All in all, Angus, Thongs and Full Frontal Snogging is a fun read for teen girls over the age of fourteen. Sexual themes are present in the book and its best if younger readers ages 12-14 wait to read this novel.

Maniac Magee,0590452037,Jerry Spinelli,Barnes and Noble,4,MissHarden on LibraryThing,"A very good book that makes you think.  It discusses tough issues, so I suggest an adult near by to ask questions.  Be prepared for racism and people acting in ways that you don't agree with.  In the end all people in this book learn something from each other which helps them grow - which I think will happen to the reader who thinks and asks questions while he or she reads this book."
Maniac Magee,0590452037,Jerry Spinelli,Barnes and Noble,4,debnance on LibraryThing,"I listened to Maniac Magee on CD. I know I have read this book in the past, but I did not remember much about it; I read it after Stargirl and found Maniac Magee less compelling.I liked it a lot more this time. Maniac is an orphan with superhero-like athletic abilities. He settles in with an aunt and uncle but soon wanders away to find a new home with a black family. At the time of this story, a white boy living with a black family is a difficult situation. Maniac becomes the target of both blacks and whites who find the situation intolerable. Finally, Maniac gives into pressure and wanders away from the black family to live with an old black man. Maniac teaches the old man to read and the man helps Maniac hone his baseball skills. Maniac is finally able to find a way to come home to live with the black family who had so warmly received him."

Twelfth Night,0743482778,William Shakespeare,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"I used this copy of Twelfth Night for my Shakespeare class, and it was far superior to the edition the professor had chosen. The text is printed on the right page and notes appear on the left. The trade paperback provides room for a decent sized font and room for notes in the margins. The notes themselves are invaluable to understanding the play, and the extended notes and commentary in the back (illustrations of the stage, notes on modernization of text...) are interesting as well as informative. This rivals texts that are twice the price."

understand Shakespeare's language. This book is absolutely wonderful. I most definitely recommend 
this for students in high school through college. Maybe middle school though it's a very small chance they
will understand the concept and comedy. As always, Twelfth Night is underrated by critics. A true classic!!"
"Gathering Blue (The Giver, #2)",0385732562,Lois Lowry,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Amy-la,"Pain. Thats all Kira feels. Pain from her crippled leg, pain from her mother's death, and pain from being deemed useless in a community where physical prowess means everything. Lois Lowry brings us yet another riveting tale about the future. But this time it is different. Where as The Giver shows a future where there is no color and no difference, Gathering Blue is a world full of color. It is about dealing with trying to find a place in a society that does not want you, that can't use you. This village appears to bring out the worst of human nature. The villages are full of greed and jealousy and hate, and they have no place, not in the village and not in their hearts, for the newly orphaned Kira, who can't do the hard labor in a village that demands for it. As Lois Lowry weaves the story of Kira, our young heroine, we are swept along on a journey of self-discovery. And it is one that will lead us to find the dark secretes that lurk in human nature. Gathering Blue is an unforgettable story, one that will leave you breathless and wanting for more."
"Gathering Blue (The Giver, #2)",0385732562,Lois Lowry,Barnes and Noble,4.2,booksatruestory,"Gathering Blue is about an orphan girl, Kira, with a gift of dyeing and weaving threads. The community and the characters are completely different from The Giver. The story feels nothing like The Giver until you get to the end, where Lois Lowry ties the two books together in a beautiful way.  And yes, you get to find out at the end what happens to Jonas. I liked contrasting this society with that of Jonas&rsquo;s from The Giver. In some ways this community is worse off because there is poverty, hunger and no education. But in some ways this community is better than Jonas&rsquo;s because there is color, personality, deep family love, and some freedom. Not a lot of freedom, but some.

I loved the naming system in this world. I found it very creative. How many syllables your name has is a status of how old they are. I loved how beautiful the writing was. Lois Lowry is a master and making you turn the pages. With every page you get a sense of something else being not quite right (as she said at her signing) and that&rsquo;s what kept me glued to the story. She goes into a lot of depth of what the main character is thinking and feeling which I loved. The story sucked me in all the way until the ambiguous ending. I have a feeling she likes those&hellip;  She said at her signing that she likes leaving things up to the imagination.  If the ending is done right, I say that I have to agree.  And Lois knows how to end it just right. I found this book to be another powerful story from her about family and love."
"Gathering Blue (The Giver, #2)",0385732562,Lois Lowry,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,I am a Language Arts teacher for 5th/6th grade.  We have read both The Giver and Gathering Blue.

This book is NOT like Hunger Games, nor like Ender's Game. When a book is written within a specific genre, often times the concepts are similar. Doesn't neccesarily make the books similar. This book was great! I highly enioyed it, and I'm 50. The characters were sympathetic, most likeable. Concept was original and engrossing. Mr. Brown, keep up the good work, and thanks for sharing.

"Red Rising (Red Rising, #1)",0345539788,Pierce Brown,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"If you cannot read about rape, gore, teens murdering, feces  this is not for you. Minimal roamance, much world building (both of Mars and of the game). Plot twists were mostly not predictable, but some cliche. A lot of action, survival, and adventure."
"Red Rising (Red Rising, #1)",0345539788,Pierce Brown,Barnes and Noble,4.4,tpolen,"This was unlike any dystopian novel I've ever read - even the setting was unique - Mars.  As with most dystopians, a lot is at stake and in the case of Red Rising, it's freedom of people in a social system categorized by colors - and I don't mean race.  Gold is at the top of the food chain and red, the color of soil on Mars, is at the bottom.

Darrow pulled me in from page one.  He begins as a hard-working guy who loves his wife and family and just wants to provide for them, but by the end of the book, his naive view of the world has changed and he's undergone tremendous growth.  I can't wait to see what he does in the sequel.

I have to admit, somewhere around the early middle of the book I began to lose interest and felt like the plot strayed a little, but before long, I couldn't put it down.  The last half was completely testosterone-filled, which isn't a bad thing for someone who doesn't read chick-lit, and I was totally captivated.  The cast of characters also included some strong women who could hold their own in physical challenges against men.  With the actions and level of intelligence of some characters in this book, at times I found it difficult to believe they were teenagers, but they are a product of their environment and did what they needed to survive.

I would recommend this book to any dystopian lovers and it would be a great read for age 15+ teenage boys (girls too, but we all know it's harder to get a book in front of the guys).

This review is based on a digital copy from the publisher through NetGalley."
"The Way of Shadows (Night Angel, #1)",0316033677,Brent Weeks,Barnes and Noble,4.5,BluHawk,"""Way of Shadows"" has to be one of the most well written fantasy books I have ever read. It transports you into a 'shadowed' world with some extremely dynamic and interesting characters. Although a good portion of this book was difficult for me to stomach, I feel that Weeks was trying to emphasize that you can't fully appreciate the light unless you have experienced darkeness. I was extremely impressed by this novel, and I can't wait to read what Weeks comes out with next.

I think fans of Salvatore's Artemis Entreri will enjoy the characters, and fans of Stephen King will enjoy the writing style."
"The Way of Shadows (Night Angel, #1)",0316033677,Brent Weeks,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Enma,"This series is one of the few sets of books I can read over and over again and not get tired of it. It lacks the usual five paragraphs explaining some random lady's coat nor does it linger on a single detail. Its fast paced and it almost feels as if you're there, watching it like a movie rather than simply reading it. It introduced different ideas, wraps up nicely, and leaves space for future stories. Some of it was predictable and it included some cliches' but not necessarily in an irritating way. It was more believable than the norm. All and all these are the best books I have read in a while and compared to what I usually read the change in pace is a relief. It is not a story for the light of heart."
"The Way of Shadows (Night Angel, #1)",0316033677,Brent Weeks,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Wade-Black,"Way of Shadows is heartfelt without being corny, and philosophical without being preachy.  The way Brent Weeks switches plot streams keeps the reader constantly engaged and on edge.  The book reads like a gritty and modern R- rated superhero legend.  The devil is in the way Weeks details the arts of war and assassination.  Way of Shadows does not lack for action or an intelligent story that forces the reader to rock back on his/her heels with each new twist.  Totally addicting and satisfying."
"The Bean Trees (Greer Family, #1)",0812474945,Barbara Kingsolver,Barnes and Noble,4.1,GeorgeEllington,"I admit, I am no great fan of modern American literature. Apart from Ernest Hemingway, Philip Roth, and Raymond Carver, I hardly touch the stuff. I prefer a foreign setting, not to mention a different genre. And with that bias, I approached Barbara Kingsolver at long last, and found The Bean Trees to be remarkably compelling. The story of Taylor Greer, on a journey across the country, heading nowhere in particular, simply seeking to escape her dreary life. Only to be handed a life she could not have expected when a baby is thrust into her car and left in her care. Kingsolver has created characters who seem quite far from me, lives and experiences distinct from my own. Yet somehow she manages to make me care about these people. She can weave a tale around a superficially simplistic setting, a deceptively banal event - and inject it with such meaning, such feeling. Cheers to you, Ms. Kingsolver. I look forward to reading more of your works."
"The Bean Trees (Greer Family, #1)",0812474945,Barbara Kingsolver,Barnes and Noble,4.1,chloesmomst,"I was not hooked from the begining. But in a few brief turns of the pages the characters came to life. Bean Trees is a bit quirky. The characters are strange and the locations even stranger but the reader begins to care about the characters. Taylor seems to be floating thru life accepting whatever comes to her but as the story progresses she finds herself and her voice. The relation with LouAnn deepens and LouAnn deepens as a person. The caring of Mattie for the people you know and those you don't is unique. And the relation between Esteven and Esperanza to each other and Mattie and Taylor and Turtle is beautiful and deep.
This is not the best book I have ever read but it is worth reading from beginning to end."

"Walking Disaster (Beautiful, #2)",1476712980,Jamie McGuire,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"Did I really just pay $7.99 to read the same story but told by Travis?  Even worse, did it really take this author a year to come up with the same story?  Don't waste your money!!!"
"Walking Disaster (Beautiful, #2)",1476712980,Jamie McGuire,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"I cannot say I don't like this book because I really loved Beautiful Disaster. Unfortunately, I make the mistake of re-reading BD the day before this book's release, and it is as if the author simply went through her manuscript and changed the expository writing from Abby's view to Travis' and all of the dialogue is the exact same, with the exception of a few new scenes involving Travis in which Abby was not a part. This being said, the book is as good as the first...because it is the same story, but it will be far more entertaining if you don't refresh yourself on the original..."
"Walking Disaster (Beautiful, #2)",1476712980,Jamie McGuire,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Laurab68,"Walking Disaster is Jamie McGuire's follow up to her wildly successful self-published novel Beautiful Disaster. Only this time we get into Travis &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Maddox's head. This book is so anticipated that we who got early copies were lip-locked. Embargoed if you will.




I think Jamie had a good idea, but the I feel the construction failed. We know the story. We know what happens and seeing it from Travis' point of view doesn't give us insight into him at all. Yeah, we get a few bit of his interaction with his mom, but really how many three year old's remember vividly what happened? Losing a mom is momentous, but when you're three you don't quite understand the significance of it all. So I found the prologue, first chapter a bit weird.




I wanted more Travis-centric scenes with people other than Abby. I know what happens, I know they fall in love, fight, break up, are a beautiful disaster of a couple. But I wanted to see more of what was making Travis tick. There were a few scenes with him and Shepley that were nice. One scene with his dad that I wish there were more of. I really would've liked to have seen more interaction with his dad and brothers.




The saving grace of this book for me was the last chapter and the epilogue. Jamie could've written a book on that alone and I would've been extremely happy because she went into uncharted territories that is brought up in BD, but skimmed over. It was a very interesting twist and I thoroughly enjoyed that. Makes me wonder if she'll continue on with that story line? I think it would work.




For me, 3/4 of the book didn't work. I was bored, wondering when I was going to learn something new. But alas, it never came.




People will gobble it up and love it. I know that I'll be in the minority on this. I just wish there was more fresh material."
"Words of Radiance (The Stormlight Archive, #2)",0765326361,Brandon Sanderson,Barnes and Noble,4.8,Anonymous,"I like to think myself a well rounded reader. That said, this book absolutely blew me away. First, I like George R R Martin much as the next person but there's something droll about reading a series that portrays ""real"" human nature. I like to think not everyone is an incestous, gluttonous, traitorous, etceterous individual who lives specifically in the moral gray area. If you are considering reading this before the first novel in this series (I have no idea why you do that) STOP and read it. This installment is like a shardbearer fighting a bridgeman or a rhysadium racing a horse. I really loved this book. If you were afraid that Words of Radiance wouldn't measure up have no fear.

The story continues in the shattered plains and beyond as the book picks up precisely where WOK left off. Like the previous novel, there is a flashback sequence which involves the manipulative, sometimes infuriating Shallan. It is difficult to even skim a summary because there is just so much information in this book, not to mention pages. 

I will say that I feared that there would be too many questions, not enough answers, too many new characters, etc... the typical concerns that stem from a series, particularly epic fantasy. However, there is a stunning ending along with more suspense and adventure and answers than you can shake a log at. However, however, however, you will still be begging for more more more. Please Mr. Sanderson may I have another? Seriously though, I'm not exaggerating when I say this is one of my favorite books. If the quality of the novels stays in pace this will be a monumental series. Real heroes in a world obsessed with darkness. Damn refreshing. But don't take my word for it, go to your local libra.... bookstore and get yourself a copy. 

PS. The hardcover is cool. The drawings are amazing. It's also cool on the nook because you can zoom in on said illustrations. Yeah I bought both versions, wanna fight about it? 

Just kidding I hate family guy."
"Words of Radiance (The Stormlight Archive, #2)",0765326361,Brandon Sanderson,Barnes and Noble,4.8,Anonymous,"This series is supposed to be near to Brandon Sanderson's heart, the story he is most eager to tell, and as I read through, I felt that. It feels so complete and well rounded. There is clearly direction to the arc, and every moment is compelling. I've read nearly all on Brandons novels, and love his style, but this series is a statement for him. Clear as day, he has come in to his own and this series is the culmination of that."
"Words of Radiance (The Stormlight Archive, #2)",0765326361,Brandon Sanderson,Barnes and Noble,4.8,Anonymous,"This book is phenomenal. It is a strong and satisfying continuation to The Stormlight Archive. The book is great all the way through. It is exciting and answers a lot of questions from book one and new questions from book two. It's an amazing novel that I highly recommend to people who have read The Way of Kings and like Brandon Sanderson's writing. There are some faults, but they're miniscule compared to the ""awesomeness"" of this book."

"The Fiery Cross (Outlander, #5)",0440221668,Diana Gabaldon,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"Yep - this one is a RATHER LARGE read, but everything in it is necessary. Some whinge and whine that it drags on but personally I think it is superb - especially since I enjoy the historical element of these books not just the emotionally charged scenes.When I read a Gabaldon book I want to see, hear, taste and smell everything Claire, Jamie, Bree and Roger do. I want to feel like I am sitting on their shoulder, becoming part of their Clan so to speak. And in the Fiery Cross, that is exactly what I got.Take your time, read it at your own pace, and whatever you do DONT RUSH IT. The characters that become apparent in this one impact on A Breath of Snow and Ashes, so if you fly through this, you'll get lost in the next one.As always I cant praise this series enough, but at the end of the day, your opinion will be the only one that matters to you, however I hope what I say helps you make the plunge and embark on this amazing story with the same gusto you got reading Outlander aka. Cross Stitch. Brilliant read."
"The Fiery Cross (Outlander, #5)",0440221668,Diana Gabaldon,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"Having been hooked by Outlander, I anxiously awaited the sequels, and despite my vow not to purchase The Fiery Cross when it came out after waiting 2(?) years and suffering through Diana's Outlandish Cookbook (read: money-making scheme!), I broke down and purchased the new novel.     I should have trusted my first instincts and waited for paperback! I finished the book in three days and not because it was a page-turner...I was just waiting for SOMETHING to happen! This book is about 700 pages too long and the reader is forced to suffer through the menses of each character, more breast-feeding passages than a baby-rearing text, and countless (and I DO mean COUNTLESS) descriptions of Jamie's 'flowing molten tresses.' Although the central theme of the novels is the love story between Jamie and Claire, it seems as though the first 300 pages of this book was simply there to re-establish just HOW MUCH they STILL love one another. Ditto Roger & Brianna. By page 250, the author had established that Claire & Jamie and Roger & Bree would STILL sleep together...and that's IT!    There's a vague plot about the Revolutionary War coming on, also some other kind of plot involving Stephen Bonnet...but mostly the author resorts to flogging the reader with vignettes of Jamie & Claire and Roger & Bree's homelife. I have a home life with the every day banalities of kids and dishes and laundry and menses, etc. -- I don't want to spend my time reading about it too! This novel made me wonder if Diana is being paid per written word.     So -- if you're a rabid fan of the series, invest the $28 for the book. Or if (like me) you're tired of the author trying to turn spoiled Brianna and dull Roger into the exciting Jamie & Claire of Outlander, wait for the paperback. Overall, a disappointing entry in an otherwise good series."
"The Fiery Cross (Outlander, #5)",0440221668,Diana Gabaldon,Barnes and Noble,4.4,pagese,"I can see were others would begin to fall out of love with the Outlander series at this point.  They are tedious and heavy books that take awhile to read.  But, I still thoroughly enjoyed this one. I do wonder about some of the details.  It's almost like the editors were afraid to tell Gabaldon that she needed to take some things out.  And, it also feel like not a lot happens.  At the end, I came to conclude that it's a setup book.  It's preparing to you for things to come.  While the overall content of the book is basically day to day living on the ridge, there are events that happen that are important to the future.  I was completely dumbfounded with what happens to Roger.  There are some tense moments with the local wild life (including a snake and a buffalo).  I wish we could have gotten so more closure with Stephen Bonnet, but have come to accept that it isn't time yet.  I loved the interactions between the characters.  I loved what happens with Ian at the end.  But, most of all, this particular book just made me think.  I began to wonder if it's truly possible for a time traveler to change what happens?  And if they do, what might the consequences be?"
Jaws,1400064562,Peter Benchley,Barnes and Noble,4.1,JP_A7X,"If you are a reader that enjoys adventure stories this is the book for you. Jaws is a great story about how the little town of Amity deals with a bloodthirsty great white shark. One thing the author did exceptionally well was that he was very descriptive with the scenarios occurring throughout the novel. My favorite example of the description used is the first couple lines of the novel. Benchley writes, ""The great fish moved silently through the night water, propelled by short sweeps of its crescent tail. The mouth was open just enough to permit a rush of water over the gills. There was little other motion: an occasional correction of the apparently aimless course by the slight raising or lowering of a pectoral fin- as a bird changes direction by dipping one wing and lifting the other. The eyes were sightless in the black, and the other senses transmitted nothing extraordinary to a small, primitive brain."". This quote is shows one of the many ways Benchley uses description to paint a picture for the reader. Another thing the author did well was that he was able to make me as the reader feel what the characters were feeling. One way he particularly did this was through his excessive cursing, which really let the reader know how Officer Brody was feeling! I felt that the author did a great job writing the book, and to me he did nothing that detracted from the content of the book. Having also seen the movie, I enjoyed reading the book much better. The movie leaves out many parts mentioned in the book along with a HUGE side story having to do with Hooper that the movie completely ignores which I felt were a great addition to the story. As a whole and overall I really enjoyed the book as it was an adventure story full of action, terror, and left me wanting more. This book is appropriate for ages 16 and up as it has a lot of foul language and there are a few adult scenes that younger children should not be reading about. My advice to the reader is to sit down in a comfortable chair and start reading this fast-paced novel as you will become completely engulfed in the story of one Amity-summer-filled with terror."
Jaws,1400064562,Peter Benchley,Barnes and Noble,4.1,PainFrame,"A classic!

I think this book (like the movie) will be around forever, it's still terrifying.

What's interesting to me, being a fan of the movie, is the differences between the two. I won't ruin anything for you, but there is a huge part of the book which never made it into the film (probably for the best). Most fascinating was the difference in the end, including which characters live and the demise of the shark. I assume since Benchley worked on the movie that he approves of both versions. And for what it's worth, so do I. Great book!

It's such a great story of friendship and being independent, and being able to think for yourself.

This book is a lighthearted fun read, and it's hard not to laugh at some of the things that Pippi says."

The Elegance of the Hedgehog,1933372605,"Muriel Barbery, Alison Anderson",Barnes and Noble,3.8,ManUpWearATeeShirt,"I was weary of ""Hedgehog"" when my friends came to me in class on the day we picked what we would read for our book groups. We were all avid readers and didn't want to have to deal with students that would just use sparknotes in order to pass. This book looked interesting enough, and also had the sort of difficultly that would scare off anybody we wanted to avoid.

I am only fifteen, and even though I like to read, I don't consider myself to be very intelligent. That being said, the book was very daunting at first. The language was complicated, and I always had a dictionary by my side and a pen in my hand so I could write in definitions. Reading was occasionally tedious. My group decided to create a blog with a vocabulary list, predictions, and chapter summaries. There were times where we poured ourselves over only a couple of pages until we finally found meaning. It was a bit like one large riddle, and we were determined to find meaning. After a while, the book either became a bit easier to read or we became accustomed to the language. It went from taking me an hour to read ten pages to zipping right through it.

Even though it was an effort to complete, every single one of us agreed that it was one of the best books we've ever read. This book will make you laugh, cry, contemplate, and take notice of things you may have never seen before."
The Elegance of the Hedgehog,1933372605,"Muriel Barbery, Alison Anderson",Barnes and Noble,3.8,Carbentley,"This was just a delightful book. The two main characters are totally unique and quirky and become unlikely friends. There are many good movie and book references in it, which I always love, and there are some interweaving plots which bring a hodge-podge of personalities together. It is about who is really your family. And it treats the issue of how silly the rigid class boundaries are, and how they can keep you from discovering great treasures in one another."
The Elegance of the Hedgehog,1933372605,"Muriel Barbery, Alison Anderson",Barnes and Noble,3.8,FlashSR,"This book has been added to my list of all time favorite books. I was drawn to it initially by the title, without having read any reviews nor heard from anyone who had read it. The author quickly takes the reader to the luxurious apartment in Paris where the characters share their thoughts and minds. The combination of the intellectual, emotional and spiritual is what makes this story so powerful. Beneath the daily musings of the characters and their observations of their world lies the framework of our existence; the importance of beauty and art; ""the moments of always within never."" This book made me laugh, cry, and reach for my dictionary. It is a book that I will read again from cover to cover but right now, I find myself opening it to any random page and reveling in the powerful and beautiful writing. The combination of the descriptions of daily life among the wealthy, the discourse on such lifestyles and the ""profound thoughts"" shared by the 12 year old child offer an entertaining and thoughtful romp that will resonant with anyone who has questioned what its all about. And most importantly, remind us to look beyond the surface. ( and...Bravo to the translator!)"
Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,0743270754,"Doris Kearns Goodwin, Suzanne Toren",Barnes and Noble,4.4,IrishmanSpeaks,"The book's premise is that Abraham Lincoln was not just a great President but one who also had the motivational ability to create a highly effective team comprised of many of his rivals. These were men who had hoped to become President. Instead, they took a subservient role to a President whom Goodwin writes about in hagiographic terms. The team of rivals consisted of one time Republican presidential candidates William H. Seward, Secretary of State, Salmon P. Chase, Treasury Secretary, and Edward Bates Attorney General. The other major player in this detailed work is Edwin M. Stanton, War Secretary. This is a good read although the author is stretched at times to continually bring the overall premise together. The opening section of the book paints individual pictures of the major players, which I did not find particularly interesting. This I think is partly because some of the characters - Chase and Bates, at least to this reader are just not compelling in their own right. Thus it takes quite some time for the book to grasp this reader's attention. Although peripheral to the main story, the hardships of life during the first half of the 19th century become very obvious. Chase lost three wives and two daughters before he was forty four, while Stanton between 1841 and 1846 lost his wife, a daughter and his only brother. Another fascinating and heart rending aspect portrayed is how the Civil War tore families apart. Four of Mary Lincoln's siblings and three brothers-in-law fought on behalf of the Confederacy, while Bate's son also took up arms for the seceding states. Team of Rivals is basically a biography of Lincoln with a different twist. It is not as detailed as other works - especially in relation to some Civil War episodes, because the author tries to paint pictures of so many characters. Her portrait of Lincoln to some extent lacks objectivity. Every Lincoln weakness or vacillation has a logic or rationale. Lincoln undoubtedly was underestimated by rivals and media. One Democratic newspaper referred to him as ""a third rate Western lawyer ... a fourth rate lecturer, who cannot speak good grammar."" As a lawyer and in his early presidential years, the term ""inspirational"" does not come to mind. To some extent, his behavior did warrant this lack of respect. His lack of authority over his generals in the early stages of the war must have been disturbing for his cabinet. General McClellan treated him with a disdain and discourtesy that was mind boggling. Had Lincoln been more forceful with Generals Meade and McClellan, it is entirely conceivable the war would have ended much earlier. Kearns (and other writers) has tried to paint Lincoln as an accommodating, understanding head of state. It is probably more accurate to suggest as Martin Luther King did that he was at some stages a ""vacillating"" president. Much has been written about Lincoln's leadership, but I think, the student of leadership can learn as much from what Lincoln did poorly as he did well. Lincoln ""grew"" into the Presidency, winning over doubters and opponents slowly but surely with his down to earth, homely style. He most definitely has won over the author who paints Lincoln in very favorable terms no matter what the occasion. There is a tendency for the reader to become seduced by the portrait. Lincoln becomes more and more likeable, more and more presidential as the book develops. Ultimately, the rea"
Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,0743270754,"Doris Kearns Goodwin, Suzanne Toren",Barnes and Noble,4.4,MelissaP-bookworm,"I've ready many biographies of Lincoln, but never from this perspective -it is so well written and you see Lincoln thru the eyes of his contemporaries - how they first view him and how their view of him changes into respect, love and even an almost worshipful appreciation that no other man could have been sent by God to lead the country through such a perious time.  I had never appreciated the politician Lincoln was.  Crafty as a fox, he engaged in political practices we now use, that no one at that time thought of.  He was a deep thinker who thought way ahead of anyone else.Everything has come from the personal writings, journal, letters, and speeches made by his contemporaries and their family members who were eye witnesses to his life and time in office.  All his opponents thought he was a dumb, hick, rail-spliter with no education.  When he beat them all (democrats & republics) and then put the best of them in his cabinet. They all planned to control him like puppet masters. Yet, one by one (depending on their own wisdom and discernmen) they soon came to learn that Lincoln truly was the Best Man for the job and they all came to give him their heart's work in his behalf.  True there is back scene manuvering to get around Lincoln by a few malcontents but it ALWAYS backfires due to the ingenious handling of the situation by Lincoln.  He never treated an enemy unkindly, he showed warmth of heart to all, he was a man of the people and the first and probably the only true humanitarian elected president that stayed that way to the day of his death.This book is full of history that we never learned elsewhere.  It was certainly relevent today - apparently the current president-elect has skimmed some ideas from the book.  I hope everyone takes the time to read it carefully.  I'm certainly going to read it again."
Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,0743270754,"Doris Kearns Goodwin, Suzanne Toren",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"I read the first chapter online.  Bought the book the next day.  I thought $23.95 was a bit steep for a paperback.  But the book is extremely well bound, and the cover surprisingly resistant to damage.  But the content!  The content of the book is unsurpassed.  It is a superlative achievment in the field of biographies.    Having recently finished another of many Lincoln biographies 'With Malice Toward None', by Stephen B. Oates, I was fairly certain that I had read the most comprehensive account of the life an times of Abraham Lincoln.  I was wrong, dead wrong.  I highly recommend 'With Malice Toward None', it was a good read, but it was nothing compared to 'A Team Of Rivals'.    Few biographies are found that are actually hard to put down, but this is definitely one of them.  Save for 'Let The Trumpet Sound', also by Stephen B. Oates, 'A Team Of Rivals' is by far, the most facinating, educational, and skillfully written biography I have ever read.    Ms. Goodwin digs much deeper than one would have imagined possible in uncovering a myriad of little known facts and events, encompacing and surrounding the legacy of Mr. Lincoln.  Most biographers focus like lasers on the central subject.  Ms. Goodwin does this with literary ease.      What elevates her work to heights well above all others, is the fact that she skillfully weaves a wealth of relatively unknown information into her work.  Unknown information about the supporting cast of characters, in so far as it relates to the main.    With this book, Goodwin has succeeded in delivering an almost enthralling account of one of the most historic periods in American history.  She does a masterful job in calling both Lincoln, and his cabinet members back from the grave.      In this book, we see an animated re-enactment of one of 'the most' turbulent times in American history, all based history, lost letters, and documented facts.    With the opening of the first chapter, we begin to feel that we know the characters, and the very natures of each major player,  in much greater detail than history books are capable of portraying.    Goodwin literally brings her subjects to life. She brings us into an intimate realtionship with the people we are reading about, as if we'd actually met them during the times in which they lived.    This book is literally pregnant with little known facts. Facts that make the events of times immanently more understandable.  More understandable as to the catalysts that set those events into motion, and greater understanding of the historical results of those events. Having read several Lincoln biographies, I can now safely say, with considerable confidence: 'A Team of Rivals' stands alone in its class.  It has no equal.      It is a masterfully painted portrait, of the legend that is Lincoln.  Unsurpassed in historical facts, vivid detail, and narrative delivery.  A remarkable work of non-ficition.  The Pulitzer prize was never more rightly bestowed, and never more richly deserved."
"Dead in the Family (Sookie Stackhouse, #10)",0441018645,Charlaine Harris,Barnes and Noble,4.1,tana928,Isn't there a way for B&N to set up the review system to not accept reviews until the book is actually released?  Every review up until this point is worthless.  Some people give low ratings because they can't download it yet or the book isn't available yet.  That just skews the whole rating system and makes it of no use whatsoever :(
"Dead in the Family (Sookie Stackhouse, #10)",0441018645,Charlaine Harris,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"Normally I do not respond to this kind of a thread, but I was getting frustrated reading some of the other posts. So here goes: Barnes and Noble allows early reviews because there is a number of readers out there with ARCs, or Advance Reader Copies of the books. This is mostly for the purpose of creating a buzz about a book before it is released to the mass market. I wish I could get hold of more of them myself, but that is beside the point. 

Instead of putting the blame on BN, politely ask the readers not to post any reviews of books they haven't read. That way, those of us more curious about the books can get accurate information from someone who actually have an early copy of it. There are plenty of other places and forums online where readers can vent and discuss books to their heart's content. This may not be the best place to do so. At least, that is not what I'm looking for on this website. Give me a good review that is not too opinionated (or speculative) or with an agenda."
"Dead in the Family (Sookie Stackhouse, #10)",0441018645,Charlaine Harris,Barnes and Noble,4.1,caduceusperserve,"I love Charlaine Harris. I have read and loved all of her Sookie Stackhouse books. 
This book disappointed me. 

SPOILER ALERT*********************** 
1.The story has no arc,no clear build up of anticipation. It was like cruising in a car enjoying the sites. 
2.The beginning of the book leads you to believe that it is about having a showdown with Victor. That story is barely touched upon and we see Sookie wanting to plot on how to kill him but is impotent to do anything about it. 
3. The chemistry between Sookie and Eric is gone. They use to burn up the pages but now they barely simmer. 
4. Eric, who always came across as the uber male bad a*# is weak and ambiguous in this book. A flimsy excuse for it is because his maker is in town and he is conflicted on how to handle him. Sookie wants him dead of course. 
5. Sookie's character development is disturbing. She has definitely changed. She has lost her innocence but not the faith she has in herself. She was raped and tortured in the last book and that would change anyone. Her attitude is reminiscent of Beatrice Kiddo in ""Kill Bill"". She wants revenge and death on anyone who has harmed her or her loved ones. Her personality is becoming closer to that of a vampire and I hope she will not choose to loose her humanity in subsequent books. 
6. I feel this book was for the fans because alot of little story lines from the past got wrapped up,(Bill gets reacquainted with his family). The story would be confusing to newcomers and I don't think they would appreciate obscure references. 

On a positive note I liked the subplot with the werewolves and I wish that would have been more developed. Sookie acted as a shaman to Alcide's pack and that was a very cool scene. 
I hope this book was just a bump in the road for Mrs Harris because she still remains my favorite author."
The Plague,0679720219,"Albert Camus, Stuart Gilbert",Barnes and Noble,3.9,rmishou,"Camus' classic is a must read.  As much great literature does, this book works on several levels.  It is a clear allegory about the dangers of fascism.  The plague begins to appear with the dramatic increase in dead rats.  The dangers are largely ignored until things have worsened and it is too late to stop the calamity.  Couple this allegory with astute insight into the psychology of human nature and Camus' work borders on amazing.  The town seems to resign themselves to their fate, barely fighting, as if already defeated. This book does not fall back to a typical medical thriller where the source must be found and millions are saved at the last minute.  Instead, Camus has people die and react to the indiscriminate nature of the disease, killing young and old, rich and poor.  As expected there are those who profit from disaster and those you have the money to buy the slowly disappearing food, but Camus resists the urge to cheapen his book with tricks and fabricated action scenes.  This books is an intense, existential  study of the human psyche in the face of a natural disaster or, allegorically, a dangerous, oppressive government bent on killing individuality and imagination.  Camus leaves the reader with the chilling reminder that the plague can lie dormant for years and return at any time."
The Plague,0679720219,"Albert Camus, Stuart Gilbert",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"Camus', The Plague, is a gripping novel that is definitely worth reading. Camus focuses on the human experience by illustrating the power that fear of an undiscriminating plague with terrible suffering has over an impersonal community  the power to bring them together. At the time, the people in the city of Oran, in Africa were distant, lifeless, and cold until forced into cooperation in a fight for their lives to stop the spreading plague and counteract the terrible human suffering.  With vivid imagery, Camus pulls the reader into the story and challenges what their mind can take. Visions of the Holocaust are seen through the way the people of Oran deal with the countless deaths caused by the plague. The narrator describes, 'The corpses were tipped pell-mell into the pits and had hardly settled into place when spadefuls of quicklime began to sear their faces and the earth covered them indistinctively, in holes dug steadily steeper as time went on.' The large amounts of deaths in Oran made the people and city loose all formality and personality in the deaths of their loved ones. Soon those people were just another body to bury among many.  With the constant idea of death looming over the heads of people in the city of Oran  they still found reason to push on, to beat the plague. The plague was soon taking no prisoners, it didn't matter if you were the wealthy or the poor of Oran  your life was up for the taking. Camus writes, 'But once the town gates were shut, every one of us realized that all, the narrator included, were, so to speak, in the same boat, and each would have to adapt himself to the new conditions of life.' Read The Plague and experience the struggle for yourself!"
The Plague,0679720219,"Albert Camus, Stuart Gilbert",Barnes and Noble,3.9,DeDeFlowers,"I am a huge fan of Camus. The Stranger and A Happy Death are two of my very favorite books. That being said, I had a very hard time with The Plague. The storyline is really great and I went into it with a good attitude, but I just could not for the life of me get into it. I thought it was really boring and strange to read. I could only read about half of it before putting back on the shelf. I probably will try again later.
All this being said, it is obviously loved by most of the reviewers, so it must be good. And if you like Camus' other stuff you probably will also enjoy this. I just didn't."
Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness,145162137X,Susannah Cahalan,Barnes and Noble,4.4,NJ-Nina,"This is a profoundly moving, true story of a young woman who, over the course of a few weeks, spirals into almost total madness.  Her loved ones stay by her side throughout her month long hospitalization watching doctor after doctor doing test after test handing down diagnosis after diagnosis.  When a doctor mentions a rare disease that may be the cause of the young woman&rsquo;s illness, her parents are left to decide whether or not to allow a test that may cause permanent brain damage.  
Susannah Cahalan&rsquo;s account of her life before, during and after her battle with mental illness is very well written and surprisingly readable.  As she delves into the working of the human brain the reading becomes a little dry but by the next paragraph, the reader is once again swept up into a story that is consuming and compelling.

She brilliantly writes about her bizarre and confounding illness that stumped many neurologists and takes us through her and her family&rsquo;s journey as they searched for answers to restore her health.  This book is inspiring for people/families who have ever experienced a loved one who has been misdiagnosed or has experienced loss in brain functionality.   I feel more informed and empowered by reading Cahalan&rsquo;s true story. 
 
As a person who has had a loved one experience rapid loss of brain function, I highly recommend reading this book.  I also recommend any books written by Ariel and Shya Kane.  I found great comfort reading their book &ldquo;Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment&rdquo; when my father had a stroke.  I found answers how to best support him and my family during this period of our lives.  I highly recommend reading Cahalan&rsquo;s book and seeking out the Kanes to support well-being in your life."
Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness,145162137X,Susannah Cahalan,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Read-by-Glowlight,"Susannah Cahalan, a bright young reporter for the New York Post, a talented writer with a career  full of promise, suddenly began losing her mind. One day she was doing brilliant research, and the next day she was too obsessive-compulsive about bed bugs to complete her assignment. Then she couldn&rsquo;t concentrate, couldn&rsquo;t track conversations, couldn&rsquo;t compose a simple paragraph. All for no apparent reason.

Day by day, hour by hour, reality slipped away as terror took over. Susannah doesn&rsquo;t remember the trip to the hospital or being admitted, but what she knew for sure was that she didn&rsquo;t belong there. The morning after a failed attempt to escape, she told the attending neurologist:

&ldquo;You need to let me out of here. I don&rsquo;t belong here. They&rsquo;re all saying bad things about me.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s talking to you?&rdquo;

&ldquo;The people on the TV.&rdquo;

She also heard people&rsquo;s thoughts, frightening thoughts about herself.

Then she discerned that her parents set up the whole scene: the doctors, the nurses, all of it, in order to trick her into being forced into the medical center. It was all one giant conspiracy.

In this candid and brave memoir, Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness, Susannah Cahalan reveals how it feels to be trapped inside a mind that&rsquo;s playing tricks and in a body that won&rsquo;t cooperate. It&rsquo;s all here: the madness, the details about the team of medical experts who tried every possibility to help her, her family&rsquo;s and boyfriend&rsquo;s responses, and the reaction of lifelong friends and strangers.

Her story is fascinating, horrifying, and most importantly, educational. We learn about the medical tests, the logic of the diagnostic hypotheses, and how the human brain works. We learn the questions the doctors struggled over, including the bet between two doctors as to what the correct diagnosis might be. It even includes original notes and drawings from her hospital stay.

What was destroying Susannah&rsquo;s mind? Was it bipolar disorder? Schizophrenia? Alcohol poisoning? Allergic reactions? Epilepsy? Demonic possession? No one knew and nothing they tried was working. In the meantime, she lost the ability to read and most of her speech. 

The one thing everyone agreed on is that something needed to be done fast in order to save Susannah&rsquo;s life.

This is more than a medical memoir; it is also a story of true and enduring love. Her mother and father, divorced and estranged, put aside their personal feelings to stay by their daughter&rsquo;s side through it all. Her boyfriend, the one her father thought of as a &ldquo;temporary place holder&rdquo; showed his true heart and strength by his actions. This part of the story is also important, because it shows the tenacity of love and loyalty.

My favorite part of the book is when her father gets down on his knees and prays for his daughter; and her mother, a Jewish skeptic, meets with a Baptist co-worker to join hands in prayer. Right after this, the family is led to a gifted specialist from Pennsylvania. A corner is turned, and in the end, Susannah Cahalan writes this amazing book. Near the conclusion, she writes that she makes a list of people to thank. I have to say, I hope God is on that list.

Fantastic book. Highly recommended."
"Wicked Lovely (Wicked Lovely, #1)",0061214655,Melissa Marr,Barnes and Noble,4,ThatWhichWeCallaRose,"I like to read fantasy for fun on the side and, after reading the description of this book, I thought it seemed right up my ally. After reading the first chapter I decided I would buy it at my next trip to the bookstore and I even found myself intrigued, thinking about how the story would play out for Aislinn in the time before I got to purchase it.
When I finally got the book I started reading right away. I wasn't finding myself getting really into the book or attatched to the characters. I decided to read on, figuring maybe I just wasn't used to this series, and as sometimes happens, I just needed to warm up and get used to the book.
Unfortunately, that never really happened. The story itself has potential, some of the characters are interesting (though they could definitely be developed more)...so I guess I have to chalk it up to Marr's style of writing, or lackthereof? It never pulled me in.
I was definitely curious as to what would happen and I read the book in practically no time, waiting for myself to become submerged in Marr's faery world...but then I finished the book, and it never happened.
The basic story outline isn't bad, and I think that Marr did an okay job of creating a basic world, it just needs major polishing and better writing technique...it's really just that Marr apparantly doesn't yet posess the magic it takes to pull you in, which really is what every story teller needs. That's the feeling people are truly seeking when they pick up a book, to be able to lose themselves in another world. 
Wicked Lovely wasn't capable of doing that, at least not for me."

"Wicked Lovely (Wicked Lovely, #1)",0061214655,Melissa Marr,Barnes and Noble,4,DragonsBlood,I was searching on the internet for books to read when I came across Wicked Lovely on amazon. I read the summary and simply had to send it to my friend so I forwarded the link. I read the first chapter and fell inlove with it. The next day I was at the mall and dragged my Dad into a bookstore at 9:00 at night. I learnt an important lesson...If your dad really wants to get home he'll buy you any book you want so long as he gets to leave. I started reading the book instantly and had a hard time putting it down. I'd read in the mornings before school and then again when I got home. I finished it quite quickly which I regret for I'm book-less once again. It's compelling and amazingly detailed. I recomend this book to any open minded person that enjoys a good faery story.
Curious George,039515023X,H.A. Rey,Barnes and Noble,3.8,SleepDreamWrite,Another good read.
Curious George,039515023X,H.A. Rey,Barnes and Noble,3.8,psycheKK,"I would recommend any version of Curious George, especially the original 1941 version. The story is sweet and the illustrations are delightful. I would not, however, recommend reading it all in one sitting to a toddler. I broke the story into two readings and that seemed to work out pretty well. Also, even though this is not a chapter book, it seemed like a good way to introduce the concept of them.
My book is in paperback, which is fine since I'll probably be reading the book to my son. It is a good idea to reinforce the spine of paperbacks with clear packing tape. It will help them last much longer."
Curious George,039515023X,H.A. Rey,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Elaine de Beaumont,"I ADORE Curious George.  He exhibits love and caring,  exactly what any normal ""child"" should.  Yes, he gets into trouble and his owner is there to see that he knows the correct wayvto do something.  How marvelous to instill such love and pass on knowledge!!  I guess all of this must have been missed on some people."
The Neverending Story,0525457585,"Michael Ende, Ralph Manheim, Roswitha Quadflieg",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Hosanna,"I loved this movie when I was a kid, so I bought both the DVD and the book for my son and I (when I bought the Princess Bride DVD and movie which my son loved.)I was amazed to find that the movie only covered a small portion of the book.  The rest of the book is still an adventure, that is deeply imaginative - creatively funny - and captivatingly ingenious.I hate a book or movie that is predictable, and this book was far from it.  And yet it tied most of the loose ends with a little bow.  The other loose ends are another story, and will be talked about another time =)"
The Neverending Story,0525457585,"Michael Ende, Ralph Manheim, Roswitha Quadflieg",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"I first read this book as a teenager, and it should be required reading for anyone with an imagination.  I was so glad to see an edition with the original two-color text incorporated.  I'd contemplated buying the book for a long time, but could never find a copy with the red and green text.  I'm very pleased to add it to my collection now."
The Neverending Story,0525457585,"Michael Ende, Ralph Manheim, Roswitha Quadflieg",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"I picked up this book from the local library, not expecting it to be any good after having seen the movie.  Yet I was pleasantly shocked to find that, unlike the movie, it is a psychological adventure with deep, mature themes.  Excellent fantasy."
A Beautiful Mind,0571212921,Sylvia Nasar,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"As a person interested in biography, history and psychology, I found this book to be well-written and frequently poignant. Some biographies degrade into a stiff, lifeless recitation of history, but this story is at turns interesting, insightful and compelling. It's been a long time since I have enjoyed a biography this much."
A Beautiful Mind,0571212921,Sylvia Nasar,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"Thank God someone has the courage to write a hopeful and honest portrayal of someone who is a survivor of a severe mental illness. It is a rare thing indeed to read something at all positive about the mentally ill. Bravo to the courageous and skillful writer of this book and her subject of study, Mr. Nash. Another wonderful new book to read which also gives hope to the mentally ill and the survivors of mental illness is the beautifully written new autobiography by Tracy Harris entitled 'The Music of Madness'. I highly reccomend both books if you want to be inspired and enlightened."
A Beautiful Mind,0571212921,Sylvia Nasar,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"The journey we call life is often filled with tensions and emotions which are a result of those tensions.  These things are the spices of life unless they loom so large in relation to our logical mind that they become bitter waters.  A trial it is, then, to have tensions so great or emotions so compelling that one is unable to live a 'normal' life.  It is interesting to see inside that space to which the logical mind is relegated when all other spaces are filled with the darkness of mental illness.  Peering out of the logical into the surrounding unfathomable darkness we readers can almost get a sense of what life with an  unrelenting mental illness is like.  The inspiration for us all is in the character's finding of the light and the regaining of the control of that dark side of the mind.  Another such journey from darkness into light is told by Tracy Harris in her book, 'The Music of Madness'.  In Ms. Harris' case the journey is of a brilliant Musician whose life deconstructs because of Mental illness and its tormentors.  It is at once chilling, fascinating, frightening, and like Nash she triumphs through sheer strength of will.  Both stories are inspirational, and both end up letting the reader feel that he or she just might have hope after all, no matter how high the mountain, or how deep the sea."

"The Summoning (Darkest Powers, #1)",0061662690,Kelley Armstrong,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"Chloe Saunders's life is flipped upside down the first time she see a ghost and it sees her. She's sent to Lyle House, a place for troubled teens. There she meets Liz, Rae, Tori, Simon, and Derek, five seemingly normal teenagers - well, as normal as teenagers with psychotically problems can get, that is.
But things aren't what they seems like in Lyle House. A place where its secrets could end up killing you. Incidents begin happening, raising suspicions on what's really going here.
With the help her unstable powers and a couple of ghosts, Chloe starts to uncover secrets about herself, the other residents, and Lyle House itself. She finds out enough to know that she has to escape.
At first, I kept saying, ""I'm not going to review this. I'm not going to review this."" What do you know, I'm reviewing this. After a few hours, I realized this was the only thing I kept thinking about.
The first few chapters were a bore. I was about to give up on this book, but instead, I skipped them - which should have really annoyed me, but with this book it didn't for some reason - and kept reading.
Things got interesting when Chloe arrived at Lyle house. At that point, the story never seemed to drop and it just kept going and going. Situations between the characters really draw you in and keep you in up until the end."
"The Summoning (Darkest Powers, #1)",0061662690,Kelley Armstrong,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,This book was so much better that the Twilight Saga! It was full of action and suspense the whole time! I can't wait for the Awakening!
"The Summoning (Darkest Powers, #1)",0061662690,Kelley Armstrong,Barnes and Noble,4.5,katiesbookblog,"I absolutely loved this book!  I couldn't put it down.  I read it in one day, almost in one sitting but sadly I had to go to school.  I think my favorite thing about this book is how Chloe is just like a normal teenager except that she can see and talk to dead people.  Her mom died when she was young and her dad is always away on business so she is normally alone, except for a few friends and her aunt Lauren who tries to fill in for Chloe's mom.  She usually keeps to herself so when things start to get weird she can't really tell anyone.     So, at the beginning Chloe is in a school for the arts and she is just like all the other people in her school, except a little bit of a late bloomer.  On the same day that she gets her first period she also sees her first dead person or at least the first person that she knows is dead.  After being chased through the school by a dead janitor, Chloe is sedated and sent to the hospital and told that she must spend at least two weeks in Lyle House, a group home for unstable teens. Once in Lyle House, Chloe meets some interesting people such as Liz, Rae, Simon, and Derek.  Derek is a little scary at first, always sneaking up on Chloe and accidentally throwing her across a room.  Once she gets to know him, though, she realizes that he is just like her and can't control his powers.  At first, Simon seems like he is just in the group home to stay with his brother, Derek, but once she starts talking to him she realizes that he is a supernatural also but his powers aren't as obvious as Chloe's and Derek's.  Liz also seems to have some powers but she never realizes that she is controlling them.  She is transferred shortly after Chloe arrives because instead of getting better she seemed to be getting worse. Rae also may have powers but it was really hard to tell.  She was placed in the group home shortly after giving her mom first degree burns when she never had a lighter or anything else that could have caused them. There are others in the group home, such as Tori and Peter, but Peter gets sent home after Chloe arrives and Tori is the group's resident witch and not in the supernatural way.  Tori believes that because her mom is on the board of Lyle House she can do and get whatever she wants but Chloe interferes with her plans as soon as she arrives.  Tori manages to get Chloe in many terrible situations, some potentially deadly, but it's only because she doesn't want her mom to be disappointed in her.  Tori doesn't play a really big role in the story, all she really does is get everyone in trouble.Chloe, Derek, Simon, and Rae discover Lyle Houses' secrets and realize that, maybe they aren't there because they are crazy but because of their powers.  They realize that they need to escape and that they need to do it soon.  Once out, though, things don't go exactly as planned.  They are hunted down by the nurses and owners of Lyle House and chased through warehouses by guys with tranquilizer guns.  Once the girls escape and find a safe place they think things are going to get better but none of them realized that someone close to them betrayed their trust.  Of course, I'm not gonna say who.  That would give everything away.  I truly loved this book and if you really want to know how it ends you will just have to find a copy to read.  This book is first in a new series by Kelley Armstrong.  The next book, The Awakening, will be out on April 28."
The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Other Clinical Tales,0684853949,Oliver Sacks,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"I just finished reading 'The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat' by Oliver Sacks. I'm so glad that I bought this book. The author is a neurologist who describes some of his most fascinating patients.  I feel like these characters will stick with me for the rest of my life. Among the characters you'll meet in this book are a music teacher(the title character) who can no longer recognize faces, twins diagnosed retarded who can generate six-digit primes, and a murderer who forgets his crime. There's also a sailor who is convinced that it is still 1965. The cases themselves are amazing but Sacks treats their stories with a beautiful kind of dignity. Sacks never loses sight of the person, of the soul, that he treats. This book left me with a deep sense of gratitude and a fresh hope in humanity."
The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Other Clinical Tales,0684853949,Oliver Sacks,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"This great read was long overdue and I could not put it down. I would recommend this story, filled with love and courage, to anyone.      Shannon Morgan"
The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Other Clinical Tales,0684853949,Oliver Sacks,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"The book was very fascinating and really showed how people in the clinical cases and people with the same brain disorders or  brain malfunctions lived. The book attempted to explain how, but more importantly, what was lost or gained because of the person's trauma or neurological disorder. It achieved its goal and showed a view from both the patient and the doctor. Even though the human mind may not be functioning properly, when closely looked at, the person has gained more than lost without them knowing it. This is the beauty of the brain and all of nature."
Eye of the Needle,006074815X,Ken Follett,Barnes and Noble,4.1,gailannsoebbing,"I was watching a documentary about thriller movies and it mentioned the 1981 movie ""Eye of the Needle"" which is based on the book.  I found the description fasinating and then the next time I was at B&N I found the book (I wasn't even looking for it).
It is an exciting novel with plot twists and suprises that could almost be plausible.  Mix a little bit of history with fiction and you have yourself a roller coster ride.  Reading the novel you keep thinking ""How is he going to get out of this?"" or ""Will they get to him in time?""  It is a very enjoyable book that I would recommend to anyone.  All I have to do now is find the film. :-)"
Eye of the Needle,006074815X,Ken Follett,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,Very good book.  I was reading Spy Counter-Spy at the saME TIME AND IT WAS INTERESTING HOW ONE BOOK TALKED ABOUT AN INCIDENT AND THE OTHER BOOK CONFIRMED IT (EVEN THOUGH EYE OF THE NEEDLE WAS FICTION AND SPY COUNTER-SPY WAS NOT.
Eye of the Needle,006074815X,Ken Follett,Barnes and Noble,4.1,jimmyc776,Eye of the Needle was a great book. It was always hard to put down. The Eye of the Needle takes place in world war II. The book plays with your mind a little because it goes into the mind of two main characters. One of the main characters is a professor hired by the British government the other is a Nazi spy. The Nazi spy's codename is the needle named after his stiletto he uses to kill his victims.Faber goes undercover as British civilians and gives out British secrets to Germany through radio. His real name is Faber and even though he kills innocent people and fights for the Nazis he has a conscious. Then there is professor Percival Godliman he is hired by the British government to track down Faber. In the book Percival is always one step behind Faber. Faber finds out crucial information that could effect the outcome of the war. He has to give this to Germany in person and after a series of events he ends up at a woman's house on a island with her husband who is a paralyzed British veteran. They end up falling in love. I give this book a 9 out of 10.

House of Sand and Fog,0375727345,Andre Dubus III,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Peanut-Butter,"In a nutshell, House of Sand and Fog is a struggle over a house. While this doesn¿t may not sound like a very compelling tale, hidden within these pages is a struggle well worth putting some time into cracking open. In this novel, Andre Dubus III presents the stark differences between two nationalities and two lifestyles. Through the struggle over ownership of a house, Colonel Behrani, Kathy Nicolo, and Lester Burton experience their own personal struggles with the American dream, redemption, and what one wants versus what is right.	Kathy Nicolo is a recovering drug addict who was recently left by her husband and thinks that her family considers her a failure. Her life is falling apart and she is possibly suicidal. Through a mistake by the government, her house is wrongfully taken from her and sold in an auction to Colonel Behrani. Behrani was rich and well respected in his homeland of Iran. However, when revolution broke out, he and his family were forced to flee to America where he is unable to find work. He lost his money and his status as a result and sees Kathy¿s house as an opportunity to regain this. Lester Burton fits into the story on Kathy¿s side. A married police officer who was present when Kathy was forced from her home, Lester sympathizes with Kathy and finds himself pulled into the conflict as he falls in love with her.	The book is presented so that each side can argue its points. Each chapter flips from Kathy¿s point of view and Behrani¿s. In this way, there is no clear hero or villain in the story. You actually over time can choose which character is in the wrong and will find yourself rooting for either Kathy or Behrani to get the house. The problem here is that none of the characters are very likeable. Kathy¿s a miserable slob who let her life slip from her fingers because of her apparent lack of good choices. Lester isn¿t half-bad, but would go against everything he vowed not to do and walk out on his wife and kids just like his father. Behrani is an egotistical and power-hungry old man who would risk everything just to get his status back while claiming its all for his family.	Yet that¿s life. People are not perfect and Dubus has created characters with many flaws who hardly even try to do the right thing and likeable or not, this makes them all the more real. House of Sand and Fog is the story of ordinary battles fought by ordinary people. This is its brilliance, because it is easy to relate to these characters. Dubus puts you in the character¿s mind and allows you to sift through the character¿s perspective on the world. The intimate connection Dubus creates between the reader and his characters makes it almost impossible not to sympathize with them.	The book starts slow and about as interesting as a quarrel over a house sounds. Soon after, though, the character¿s struggles grab you. Even as the plot appeared unmoving, I found that I didn¿t want to put the book down. The characters personal struggles made me keep coming back to find out what would happen to them. And the book only gets better as it goes along. I wasn¿t ready for the twist near the end, and once I got there, Kathy, Behrani, and Lester consumed my every thought. House of Sand and Fog is a book that everyone can enjoy. I highly recommend it."
House of Sand and Fog,0375727345,Andre Dubus III,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Anonymous,"This book was very well written, and each character was able to provoke a response (although I did want to strangle one of the characters). This book really illustrates the struggle people have in trying to achieve the American Dream, and the way that love influences our decisions."

As I Lay Dying,067973225X,William Faulkner,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"Faulkner's As I Lay Dying is an outstanding book, however, it is extremely confusing. My English teacher, who required that we read the book our freshmen year in high school, told us that it's usually a book meant for grad students to read. The book is confusing, but Faulkner's style is unique and will definitely influence your own. His novel requires readers to stop and judge characters, it is necessary to constantly analyze. This is an excellent read for budding writers such as myself, because his style has had so much of an impact on my own. Read it not for enjoyment, because it is boring, but for the improvement of your own writing! It'll improve it so much, you'll notice it yourself."
As I Lay Dying,067973225X,William Faulkner,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"When reading Faulkner, you always wonder whether the book doesn't make sense or if you are just not as intellectual as is he. I like to think I'm not as intelluctual so my brain is stiumlated by the endless meaning and layers within his books. As I Lay Dying is not a happy story, but that is kind of evident within the title. The syntax and diction used is spectatcular. You find meaning in the way the text is written and the format of the words. In order to understand the novel, you have to read with a pencil in hand, underlining anything that seems important or significant because it most likely is signifcant. The characters are all narrators to the book. I believe, 17 total different point of views. The tricky part is figuring out whose story it is and what is the main theme. I always look at the book and try to figure out what is the meaning. As I Lay Dying gave me endless meanings and i loved being challenged to find them. Although it is simple with language and style, it is close to impossible to decipher the deeper meanings. You constantly second guess yourself because it is hard to know what is ""the right answer."" But after reading I felt accomplished, and dare i say, smart. There are so many meanings and none that probably come close to Faulkner's original message but it is worth discovering your own meaning to the story. I believe not only this book but all of his books give readers the opportunity to gain their own message within the text. Faulkner is brilliant and I recommend all his books. They are challenging and I believe are best with discussion groups just so you can hear what other meanings are found. I really enjoyed this book it is short, easy to read just hard to decipher bigger meaning. I find it challenging yet enjoyable. I hope you enjoy as much as I did :)"
As I Lay Dying,067973225X,William Faulkner,Barnes and Noble,4,BunnyFace,"So, I just finished reading ""As I Lay Dying"" this morning on my way to work. Let me start off saying that this is the second novel that I have read by William Faulkner. I became intrigued by Faulkner's works when a co-worker told me that ""The Sound and The Fury"" is frequently called one of the toughest novels to read, and he would be impressed if I finished it. So of course I read and somewhat followed it, and feel comfortable in saying that I enjoyed it. That said, starting with ""The Sound and The Fury"" made reading ""As I Lay Dying"" feel like a cake walk. I completely and totally enjoyed this novel, and would read it again as well as recommend it to friends. Now I feel prepared to take on more of his novels..next on my list is ""Sanctuary""."
"Lover Eternal (Black Dagger Brotherhood, #2)",0451218043,J.R. Ward,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Debbie-J-1970,"I really liked ""Dark Lover"" and I was looking forward to Zsadist's story in book 3, so I figured I rush on through this one to get to his story. I was completely swept into this book! I didn't care for Rhage/Hollywood too much in the first book so I certainly wasn't expecting to find him one of the best, most fun male characters I have read about in a long time! The first date scene where Rhage has dinner with Mary was so cute and endearing...for both of them. I loved Mary and I could see how Rhage feel for her so quickly. Though not conventionally beautiful, and scarred from her battles with cancer, Mary was a friendly, compassionate and accepting person. She learns he is vampire and wants to help. She learns about the 'beast' and wants to help. She sees the beast...and I wont' spoil that by saying how that goes...but this is obviously a caring and compassionate human being. I read some of the reviews here where readers didn't feel she was deserving of Rhage because she was whiny. She had battled cancer before, and now it was back worse than ever. She had battles of chemo treatments to look forward to..losing her hair... I have had some experience with people close to me having cancer. This woman had every right to be whiny and it wasn't even like it was over the top. I didn't think she was really even whiny as I read the book. She wanted to protect Rhage from watching her become sicker until she died. Like she had watched her mother. For the first time in a long time, I could really understand the attraction between two people that leads them to fall in love in the span of a book. Kudos to J.R. Ward for making me believe in this romance. Also, the other portions of the book were likewise amazing. The story of Z's fascination with Bella...the warrior to be being taken in by Wellsie and Tor..the lessers getting crazier by the minute. This book was chock full of good stuff. Put me on the side of the Black Dagger Brotherhood. Even though I may have to hide the titles when I am out in public, I am hooked!"
"Lover Eternal (Black Dagger Brotherhood, #2)",0451218043,J.R. Ward,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,I thought the duality of Rhage was wonderful. Sooo beautiful on the outside but what was hidden beneath the surface was so ugly. Hollywood's longing for a special person was touching. He was not thrilled with the lifestyle he was forced to endure to keep civilians and the people he loved safe. Mary was pretty cool too. SHe had health issues but her spirit was strong. The depth of love Rhage demonstrated to Mary was just plain awesome.
"Lover Eternal (Black Dagger Brotherhood, #2)",0451218043,J.R. Ward,Barnes and Noble,4.6,supejunkie,"This book is the second in the Black Dagger Brotherhood Series.  Rhage is a gorgeous, ego-maniacal vampire warrior within The Brotherhood.  He's almost too beautiful too look at and has appetites that are almost insatiable.

Mary is a human counselor who has battled leukemia that was in remission.  She is about to have her life utterly turned up-side down and inside-out. She meets Rhage and finds out she is out of remission.

Because you are not certain which rules this author will follow (i.e. feeding from humans, no sunlight, reflections in mirrors) you don't know exactly what to hope for as an outcome with Mary and Rhage.

Every emotion that can be felt will be felt at one point or the other while reading this book.  If you are a true romantic you will probably openly weep.

There is lots of Mary and Rhage in Lover Eternal but you aren't left wanting for the other guys, either. Wrath, V, Phury, Butch, Tohr and Z are all on hand to keep us entertained.

These Brothers are Grey Goose drinking, Escalade driving, designer clothes wearing warriors that listen to rap music and know how to keep us captivated."
"Fool Moon (The Dresden Files, #2)",0451458125,Jim Butcher,Barnes and Noble,4.3,diverwpg,"Second in the series, Fool Moon, gives a fun take on werewolves.  Who knew there were so many types?

The Harry Dresden character is witty, sarcatic and oh-so-human.  How can you not like a guy who combines the grit of Philp Marlowe with the helpless charm of an Eagle scout?  Dresden is bull-headed, reckless yet clever and resourceful.  I plan on reading many more of these books.  Too bad Sci-Fi channel didn't renew the series."

After working with wizard Harry Dresden on a previous case, Special Investigative Officer Karrin Murphy accepts that the supernatural is real.  She believes a werewolf committed the killings.  She turns to Harry as America¿s only wizard to come out of the closet to help her on the Chicago werewolf killings.      However, Internal Affairs and the local FBI want Murphy and Dresden kept out of the investigation.  The honorable Harry would love to walk away and allow the humans to make a mess of things, but in good conscience knows an 'I told you so,¿ means nothing.  Harry and Karrin track the werewolf to environmentalist Harley MacFinn, but just because he is one doesn¿t necessarily mean he is the killer.  Perhaps his shapechanging girlfriend or a teen group receiving special tutoring on the finer points of lycanthropy 101 is the culprits.  As a dark side of a bruised Harry surfaces, he struggles to survive a war not of his making.      Harry Dresden is a unique character in the urban fantasy sub-genre.  Harry is a maverick whose mouth seems to get him in as much trouble as his actions.  He is a smart know-it-all, but cannot stop himself from saving humanity in spite of mankind¿s ridicule.  FOOL MOON is a fast-paced fascinating noir thriller that keeps readers interest so that the new fan will seek out the previous novel, STOP IN FRONT and the old reader will re-peruse their copy.

"Fool Moon (The Dresden Files, #2)",0451458125,Jim Butcher,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Chipperkeet,"I held off for a long time, reading these books, because, frankly, fantasy series are usually over the top, impossible to follow with a spreadsheet, and have no bearing on reality.

These books are the diametric opposite.  Yes, fantasy, but grounded pretty firmly in actual reality, monsters and magic notwithstanding.  The characters are well developed, and the plots are exciting.  When the magic stuff comes up, it's not delved into with typical fanboi excessiveness.  There's maybe a brief line of explanation into the magical workings, but in laymen's terms that aren't annoying. 

Five books in, love every one so far.  But make sure you read them in order.  The individual stories stand on their own, but there's a LOT of over-arching plotlines that continue, book to book."
"David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants",0316204366,Malcolm Gladwell,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"Does having a disadvantage make you stronger in the long run? Malcolm Gladwell explores this and similar questions in his latest book. Like his previous works, Gladwell delves into the stories of many people (some famous, some not) to determine why some become wildly successful whereas others crash and burn. Are there key elements in their upbringing that push people to excel?

Two interesting observations revolve around dyslexia and the loss of a parent. Some of the most prominent people in the world are, surprisingly, dyslexic. Richard Branson, Charles Schwab, and Brian Glazer are three. A shocking 12 of the 44 U.S. Presidents, including George Washington and Barack Obama, lost their fathers when they were young. Gladwell explores the possibility that people who are faced with a major disadvantage can use it to propel them to heights they otherwise would not have achieved.

While this book is very thought-provoking, I must admit that I can't completely agree with all of it. I found some conclusions to be over-simplified. Even so, this an entertaining and worthwhile read. Gladwell fans will definitely appreciate it.

Readers of this book should also consider two others with similar themes. Gladwell's stories reminded me of my favorite recent memoir, Dr. Anthony Youn's &quot;In Stitches&quot; which explores how a young underdog overcame his insecurities to eventually become a successful physician. 

 The second book I recommend is Gladwell's &quot;Outliers: The Story of Success&quot; which examines what factors make some people succeed and others fail. A similar theme as &quot;David and Goliath,&quot; this one looks at what intangibles contribute to one's success. It's a thought-provoking and fun read."
"David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants",0316204366,Malcolm Gladwell,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"Malcolm Gladwell has such a clean, lyrical, just downright fun to read style, that it is only by degrees, 
over a series of his publications, I have slowly developed the opinion that his surgically clean, 
brick-by-brick arguments are often fairly thin, sometimes blatantly card-stacked and may lead to 
highly questionable conclusions.

His latest publication David And Goliath, is, in my opinion, the most egregious in this regard.

Just today, I read of a study in the journal Pediatrics that found children without fixed bedtimes
were much more likely to develop behavioral problems by the age of seven. 
The conclusion pointed to restlessness, irritability and other issues related to the lack of sleep.
 Yet It occurred to me that was quite a leap. Isn&rsquo;t  it possible that parents who don&rsquo;t enforce 
regular bedtimes don&rsquo;t enforce a lot of things?  Isn&rsquo;t it possible that the children in the study developed
behavioral problems due to a lack of discipline and not a lack of sleep?  
I don&rsquo;t know which is the right conclusion, but would not publish the former as science. 

This is my sense of Malcom Gladwell&rsquo;s work; certainly in his latest work under discussion here.

A good example of what I&rsquo;m talking about can be found in the opening chapter, where he attempts to
provide a partial explanation for Goliath&rsquo;s behavior by suggesting that 
( according to &ldquo;many medical experts&rdquo; ) he suffered from the medical condition acromegaly. 

Sorry, but Really? 

How is anyone, Doctor or not, to diagnose a complex medical condition from a few paragraphs 
reported by a third party in an arcane religious text that, for all it&rsquo;s beauty, is not always known 
for its&rsquo; literal bent? It is like finding an ancient skull with a neatly bored hole in it and concluding 
the civilization was competent at brain surgery. Maybe an interesting thought.
Maybe worth a bit more research. But not a fact to be employed in support of an argument.

David and Goliath also lacks a focus. Though most chapters do pertain to an underdog them of
some sort, some do not. In fact, the underdog theme seems designed to roll out the 
Inverted-U-shaped curve theory, which then dominates the rest of the book. The book is more about 
the idea that you CAN have too much of a good thing ( be too rich, have too small a class size&hellip;) 
than it is about the little-guy winning.

Gladwell just doesn&rsquo;t put two and two together in this book. He features a lengthy chapter about
California's three-strikes law as yet another example of the inverted-U-shaped curve,
 yet his statistics in support of the failure of the three-strikes-law are anything but conclusive. 

In fact, he as much states that nobody really agrees as to whether &ldquo;three-strikes&rdquo; works. 
He indicates the law was eventually significantly watered down and leaves you to deduce 
that his proposed cause and effect was the reasoning behind it.

Lastly, and perhaps this is a bit shallow of me, but the subject matter of the book is often disturbing. 
There is a chapter that describes children suffering terribly from Leukemia. 
Another where a young girl is bound and tortured.  

It&rsquo;s selfish, I know. But I don&rsquo;t want to read that. I don&rsquo;t want to pay to read that.

As Woody Allen&rsquo;s fictional author in Manhattan once intoned while searching for an opening chapter,
 &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s face it, I want to sell a few books here&rdquo;.  That is how I feel about David And Goliath. 
Gladwell was on the hook for a new Bestseller but lacked the inspiration that led to the more
concise and &ldquo;tighter&rdquo; Outliers.

What we got was a collection of often disturbing essays that he struggles to stuff 
beneath a single umbrella."
"David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants",0316204366,Malcolm Gladwell,Barnes and Noble,4,MarketingGuy,"The biblical story of David and Goliath is a story of courage but also of overestimating strengths and misunderstanding the power of playing a different game to make the person who seems weakest be victorious.

In the face improbable odds, finding themselves inferior in scale, ability or resources is what pushes certain people to try things out of the ordinary, re-think the rules and play a different strategy &ndash; which is a formula for winning. This book makes the point in the story of Bedouins, David and Goliath and the underdog basketball team that goes undefeated.

Malcolm invites us to challenge the assumption that bigger is better. One of his key points is that when you are too big , too good, too strong &ndash; you advantage starts becoming a disadvantage. He challenges us to re-think our assumptions of what is good, what is bad, what is a strength, and what is an advantage. He points out that disadvantages can be advantages and that difficulties can produce resiliency and courage.

The central line is about the power of being different, becoming the big fish in a small pond that you create rather than being a small fish in a large pond &ndash; like the impressionists, who created their own pond, went against the current, and converted their weakness into strength.

Adversity has the potential to make us much stronger, more resilient and courageous &ndash; when it does not crush us. People who have gone through difficult times tend to think different, challenge the status quo, and take the bold chances that people who have had it easy have not had the need or the guts to do. Those who re-think the rules and take a new road are the people who change the world.

The second part of the book is about the idea that if you are Goliath, if you are in a position of strength, trying to dominate the Davids by force can be counterproductive. Authority requires legitimacy. The book talks about stories from MLK to religious clashes in Ireland to make the point. 


As you expect from Malcom, the stories are very interesting, enjoyable and even captivating.  Yet, at the end of the day the book does not leave you with a set of powerful ideas that you have not heard before. The story of David and Goliath is thousands of years old and has been told many times.

I did not find this book as intellectually stimulating as some of his previous books that have left me with a new way of thinking and have provided a foundation for more ideas to be built upon, like the Tipping Point or Blink. I can recommend this as an enjoyable read but not a breakthrough."
"Fullmetal Alchemist, Vol. 1 (Fullmetal Alchemist, #1)",1591169208,"Hiromu Arakawa, Akira Watanabe",Barnes and Noble,4.7,BATTOSAI,"Hey, it's BATTOSAI with another review, FullMetal Alchemist is a great manga but it's not for everyone, see why in my review of,
FullMetal Alchemist volume 1
Personal score 9.7 out of 10
Age rating 14+
Genre shonen(boy/men), action/adventure, drama.
The story to FMA is probably one of the greatest to grace the pages of manga history' two young brothers learned the ways of alchemy, and attempted a ""human transmutation""
(Taboo in alchemical law), to try and revive there dead mother, they ultimately fail resulting in Edward Elric (the older brother) to lose his right arm and left leg, and his younger brother Alphonse to become a soul in a suit of armor.
There's not much to the story in this volume, just a collection of mini stories, and it starts off in an odd spot but you'll get it fairly soon.
The extra stuff in the back is a classic staple for manga, and FMA has some good ones back there.  
The characters are really interesting, each with his or her own crosses to bear, and deep personalities.    
Now remember when I said ""it isn't for everyone"", well this is why, it deals a little in religion and politics, some might even go as far to say that alchemy is a form of witchcraft, well the thing is it's fictional, nothing but a work of the imagination, if you really want to make a stink about it go ahead, but remember people, it's a book, nothing more, nothing less, so if your sensitive to that stuff this manga isn't for you. 
The artwork is good and makes leaps and bounds in later volumes; it's an interesting combination of thick lines and sharp edges that make for a gritty, dramatic experience.
Manga to anime, read the manga, the anime is so far off the original story it will confuse you when reading the manga.   
I hope this review was helpful, and I plan on reviewing more FMA, so until then, good reading."

Something is always happening to keep you on your toes, and every chapter is important. its about two brothers that learned alchemy(a science like magic) at a young age. thier father left them a time ago and thier mother died. Having no one to take care of them and for the love of thier mother, they try to bring her back to life using alchemy. But failure wasnt the only bad thing that could happen, the younger brother Alphonse loses his entire body, he is only a soul now controlling a suit of armor. and Edward the older brother loses his left leg and then trades his right arm for his brother's soul that he transmutes to armor. The brothers will never try to bring thier mother back again but they burn they're house and leave town for edward to become a state alchemist and find a answer to getting thier original bodies back. but what thier looking for is very dangerous."

"Guards! Guards! (Discworld, #8)",0061020648,Terry Pratchett,Barnes and Noble,4.5,ZeanAmush,This is probably the best first stop if you want to jump into the discworld. It is also the beginning of the watch of Anhk-morpork story lines. A great must read.
"Guards! Guards! (Discworld, #8)",0061020648,Terry Pratchett,Barnes and Noble,4.5,RichardSutton,"I was introduced to Pratchett's words only recently -- late in my reading career -- by author Henry Gee, who then stood back to watch the mental explosion. He was on to something, alright. Long aware of Mr. Pratchett's name, legions of fans and occasional witty quote, I had no idea how all-encompassing his writing could be. Guards! Guards! is my introduction to the author's beloved Discworld and my key to future submersions as well. It is a perfect tonic for our times and our silly culture offering big, heaping helpings of wry humor, cynicism and sarcasm. In my case, particularly, it came at a perfect time for a fan of George R.R. Martin's work suffering withdrawl until his next volume is released and in desperate need of comedic relief. Pratchett's novel takes place on the fetid, dysfunctional streets of a major city where a benevolent (?) dictator is about to be replaced by something much worse. Not even human, but sadly, in so many ways, completely expected. Dragons, it turns out are people, too. Misunderstood, subject to soul-numbing stereotyping and completely consumed by gastric issues. This book will keep you in stitches throughout and give you plenty of occasions to reflect on where our priorities lie. Don't wait. Hie thee to a bookseller and purchase this book.

The Year of Magical Thinking,1400078431,Joan Didion,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Cherie-Renfrow-Starry,"For clients who have lost a spouse, a child, a beloved family member, or a close friend, I recommend this book as a starting point in investigating the disbelief and numbness that accompanies a sudden death. However, I also recognize that this is not an easy book to read because it exposes raw emotions and forces the reader to consider his/her own views about death and dying as well as grief and grieving.  

Joan Didion is an award-winning writer. However, Didion did not become a well-known name outside of Manhattan publishing circles until 2005 when her 13th novel, The Year of Magical Thinking, was published. It subsequently won the National Book award for nonfiction. With the publication of this work, Didion found a new following of readers, namely, widows and widowers who had lost a spouse or partner unexpectedly. Her public pain, lack of focus, and search for direction at the sudden loss of her husband of 40 years, John Gregory Dunne, was complicated by the serious illness of their only daughter, 39-year-old Quintana Roo, who died just a few months before the publication of her mother's ground-breaking novel.

Didion had just turned 69 years old on December 5, 2003. On December 30th, John Gregory Dunne, her husband and co-writer, died instantly from a heart attack.  They had just returned to their apartment after visiting their gravely-ill daughter, Quintana, at Beth Israel North (hospital) in New York City where she had fallen into a coma after being diagnosed on December 25th with pneumonia and septic shock. Ms. Didion's rendition of what happened in the apartment is sparse, terse, impassive, and detached depicting what most literature describe as ""the moment of stunned disbelief that the impossible has become real"" ( p. 113).

Losing a spouse after 40 years of marriage is beyond traumatic. The fact that Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne were collaborators on numerous screenplays and articles as well as collaborators in a longstanding marriage marks the loss as inconceivable, as if one person was not only an extension, but the embodiment of the other. In an interview, Didion confessed that she had difficulty in finishing this book because it was the first writing she had done which John had not read. 

The popularity of Didion's memoir revolves around her candidness about the process of grieving the loss of a loved one and the process of rebuilding some semblance of life after that loss. Her loss is made more salient due to its suddenness and the concurrent stress of her daughter's illness. Moreover, Didion was the person to tell her daughter about her father's sudden death, only to subsequently witness her daughter's death as Quintana was rushed to the hospital with a brain hematoma while returning from her father's funeral. Because the book was in publication at the time of her daughter's death, Didion does not broach the subject of her daughter's death in this book. Rather, she focuses on her own grieving and mourning processes or lack thereof and outlines one of the most difficult developmental tasks of aging: rebuilding a meaningful life after the loss of a spouse.

The Year of Magical Thinking,1400078431,Joan Didion,Barnes and Noble,3.9,AKABookSnob,"Joan Didion's pain and suffering are profound and her loss overwhelming. I found this piece comforting from the point of view of having lost both my parents in the last year. It is intelligent, crisp and compelling. I am impressed with her bravery to write so intimately. Taking this journey with Joan is not easy. I think this book has to come into your life at the right time for you to love it or even appreciate it. Unfortunately, I think that requires having suffered the loss of a loved one yourself.   
This was my first exposure to Didion's work but I have already picked up two other books I hope are just as smart."
We Need to Talk About Kevin,006112429X,Lionel Shriver,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"I just finshed this excellent novel and I am overwhelmed.  The writing is outstanding, and I have not been able to stop thinking about these characters.  Kevin is a sociopath AND he is evil. Mostly, I am struck by Eva's love for Kevin, which is apparent throughout, but especially at the end of the story.  This novel is thought- provoking, disturbing and frightening.  I highly recommend this novel to readers who love to figure out the endings (I did, with the help of wonderfully placed clues) of incredibly well written books.  Truly the best novel I've read in a long while!"
We Need to Talk About Kevin,006112429X,Lionel Shriver,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"I picked up 'We Need to Talk About Kevin' because of the subject matter. Not because it was about a killing spree at a high school, but because it was told from the viewpoint of the mother of the boy who killed his classmates and a teacher. It puts a twist on the 'common' Columbine-like story.     The novel begins after the melee, as the mother, Eva, traces the history of her son Kevin back through his days as an infant, through all his apathy and wicked stunts growing up. She tells Kevin's story in long letters written every other week or so to her estranged husband. At first, this seemed like the actions of a crazy woman trying to re-establish her marriage. But who on Earth would ever want to reconcile with a nagging, pretentious woman who uses long diatribes with $10 words to fault you throughout your marriage?     Not until halfway through the novel was my interest fully grabbed and I didn't tire of reading another whiny letter from Eva. Up until that point, Eva comes off as a pompous woman with whom I really couldn't relate...and really didn't want to. You later realize, though, that this perspective is probably the way Kevin viewed her and why he held such resentment for his mother.     The story itself is a good example of the old Nature vs. Nurture debate. Are people inherently born evil? Or is it based on the way they're raised? Although this novel doesn't answer the question, it gives credence to both arguments and can make for an interesting discussion.     The ending of the novel is very dramatic and offers an interesting manipulation in events, which I appreciated. At that point, I was absorbed into the characters' lives and actually wanted more. I felt like a part of their 'dysfunctional' family. The characters felt real, with the exception of Franklin, Kevin's father, who resembled the 'golly gee' Mike Brady from The Brady Bunch (the movie version, not the TV one). It's hard to believe that Eva would ever marry such a naïve man. After finishing the novel, my only disappointment (and boredom) with the actual writing was that the author used an overload of detail to tell what turns out to be an excellent story. (My Creative Writing teacher would have scratched red lines through numerous sentences and paragraphs, as they seemed extraneous). Less is more!     If I learned anything from reading this book, it can be summed up in this one sentence: 'You can call it innocence or you can call it gullibility, but [she] made the most common mistake of the good-hearted: she assumed that everyone else was just like her.' On that note...don't watch your back, watch what's in front of you."
We Need to Talk About Kevin,006112429X,Lionel Shriver,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,One of the most brutally honest books I have ever read. Taking such a different slant on such a tragedy was thought provoking. An unforgettable look at our culture and getting right to the core.
"The Queen of the Damned (The Vampire Chronicles, #3)",0345419626,Anne Rice,Barnes and Noble,4.3,XXXOOOBookwormOOOXXX,"If you are new to this series, please *PLEASE* for the love of the gods read Interview With a Vampire first and do the books in order. Otherwise you will have no clue what's really going on, and you will definitely not be able to appreciate this book as much. Trust me on this, my friend made that mistake.  Far and away the best work in the entire Vampire Chronicles, Queen of the Damned left me hanging on the edge of my seat from cover to cover. Unlike the other books in the series, it picks up exactly where the previous book, The Vampire Lestat left off. Anne Rice has long been one of my favorite authors and this one does not disappoint.  As in The Vampire Lestat, Queen of the Damned is narrated by Lestat. But unlike 'Lestat, Queen of the Damned includes side views and stories by others observers, and after all the events were over, told Lestat the story.  The action is spread out over six thousand years from one end of the world to the other, with a lot of mythology and pondering taking the place of the thrilling, energetic action of the earlier novels.  It is here that we come face to face with the origins of the vampires, with thousands of years of mystery and blood. We see our intrepid anti-hero, Lestat, both enraptured by and at odds with the most powerful vampiress yet.  My all time favorite character of her's is in this book Khayman a vampire so old he has forgotten who he is. This is such a rich and beautiful book that I would recommend it to everybody. It explains how her vampires came into being and answers so many of the questions that Louie had in Interview with the Vampire her first novel in this series."

Don't even try to watch it without first reading the book!  I spent most of the movie explaining who certain characters were and what the motivation was behind about half of the characters' actions.      I adore Ann Rice and this book was one of my favorites.  The characters are complex and so easy to fall in love with.  Akasha is one bad female, but I can't say that her plans for world domination didn't have certain agreeable aspects.  Hah, Hah!  The plot can get a little confusing as both new and older, beloved characters are introduced into the fray.

The Age of Innocence,159308143X,"Edith Wharton, Maureen Howard",Barnes and Noble,3.9,BANCHEE_READS,"The Age of Innocence is a thought provoking literary piece which I enjoyed immensely. It is written in a simple, accessible style, yet deeply portrays human emotions and interactions in late 19th century New York City. This novel represents an account of high society life of the 1870s. The events of this novel are wrapped around a prevailing lifestyle of jealousy, shame, and excessive pride which colors the main characters. Not unlike many other segments of the society, then and now, the characters of this novel attempt to disguise these feelings through hypocrisy and deception.
In a time where keeping appearances is everything, the protagonist, Newland Archer, is at conflict with himself. He is engaged to May Welland, who represents stability and the traditional high society life. He begins to fall in love, however, with May's cousin, Countess Ellen Olenska. After seeing Ellen and her freedom and spontaneity, he begins to question his life and why he feels the need to conform. He realizes how dull his life is and how materialistic and fake the high society aristocrats are. He loves May, but cannot stand the idea of living such a predictable life with no deeper meaning. In the end, he must choose between living the life he is expected to live with May, or being happy with Ellen, yet ruining the family name."
The Age of Innocence,159308143X,"Edith Wharton, Maureen Howard",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"So, I have to admit:  this was not my favorite classic novel.  However, I understand why it is a classic and I do feel it is well worth reading.  I have a few issues with some of the characters and I wasn't as moved with the love story as many others were.  To me, Newland did not have to marry May...he knew before he married her that he really wanted Ellen.  So, I guess I don't pity him too much and I really don't know what he expected to happen other than the fact that he would never be happy with May.  I'm really glad Ellen didn't allow him to cheat on May with her either.  At least she showed some class.  Overall, I loved seeing what old New York was like--wow, has it ever changed.  Also, I loved the themes and dialogue of the novel.  Follow your heart and don't live for others."
The Age of Innocence,159308143X,"Edith Wharton, Maureen Howard",Barnes and Noble,3.9,TulaneGirl,Loved this book. It gives an incredible view into New York society circa 1890's - all it's rules and duties. Newland Archer's conflict between what he wants to do and what he should do is engaging. It's heartbreaking to see him try to flap his wings only to have them clipped each time. One could say he should have had more character - the character to shun his duty and follow his heart. But it's hard to fault him for being an honorable man.
The Selfish Gene,0199291152,Richard Dawkins,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"I thought this necessary to balance out the religious fundamentalist who 'reviewed' this book before me. I'd like to point out that I've actually read this book, as well as creationist and intelligent design books.    In 1976, Richard Dawkins revolutionized biology not only by providing a compelling argument for gene-centered evolution (evolution being the only other choice other than us being magically made of dust a few thousand years ago) but by introducing the concept of memes.    Whether you agree with him or not, Dawkins' book is well written and deserves to at least be read in its entirety before being baselessly based by Bible-thumping, fundamentalist, reason and logic lacking creationists."
The Selfish Gene,0199291152,Richard Dawkins,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"I must acknowledge that this is perhaps one of the finest books I have encountered and read. The structure was very well thought out and written in terms that even an average individual without prior exposure to these studies can understand.   As for the poor reviews that 'Christians' are always giving Dawkins and other like minded authors and theorist. Stop wasting everyones time with your babbling reviews of repentence and redemtion and persecution. No one has asked for you to agree with our opinions/theorizations on the evolution of life and frankly we do not waste our time in attempting to persuade you to accept our opinions. A word to the Christian. PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH. Stop being selective in your Biblical scriptures and finding ways to twist what your Bible says. If you are going to defend your beliefs, stick with your guidelines in your   Bible, NOT what you misconstrue."
The Selfish Gene,0199291152,Richard Dawkins,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,Dawkins is genious. clear as day.
Year of Wonders,0142001430,Geraldine Brooks,Barnes and Noble,4,regina77004,"I went into this read really wanting to love it since I've heard such great reviews.  While there were aspects I greatly appreciated, I was sorely disappointed.  The main reason lies in the plausibility of a multitude of circumstances.  Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the concept of suspension of disbelief.  However, for me, I tolerate it less in historical fiction than other genres.

Inspired by actual events that occured when residents of Eyam Derbyshire voluntarily quarantined themselves in response to an outbreak of The Plague, Brooks allows the full range of human responses to play out.  Some residents see the outbreak as a punishment from God and commit to extreme penitence such as self flagellation, others turn on their neighbors, others collapse under their own greed, and some focus on service.  

There are some things with which Brooks does an excellent job. Within a fairly short novel, Brooks aptly develops rich characters that truly reflects human nature.  Her protagonists have flaws.  That was refreshing, particularly when contrasted with their extreme heroic actions.  The story itself is well developed, and she is able to portray the emotions of the characters in a vivid manner.

Where she lost me was in the intuitive knowledge that Anna is imbued with. It just really irritated me.  I couldn't figure out why Anna had not discovered a cure for The Plague. Further, the historical context for some of the medical knowledge seems a bit stretched by about 100 years."
Year of Wonders,0142001430,Geraldine Brooks,Barnes and Noble,4,Kaco2000,"I just this moment finished reading Year of Wonder. Anytime I find myself talking to the pages as if they would me in reply I know it¿s a great read. I was elated to get to the end as the ending was not at all what I expected.  As a matter of fact I scarcely imagined Anna & Michael¿s rendezvous, though I hoped for it once Elinor was gone. The story is fluid & engaging & it drew me in like a friend confessing a her truth to me in confidence. I am glad that I generally choose what I read based on the way the cover looks. Year of Wonder like the painting on the cover is a sensual, full-bodied tale chocked full of historical references & language (including idioms that I had to research)that made the story most believable. I was swept into the story & enjoyed it immensely. I plan to add this to my own library so that I may read it again.I highly recommend the book to anyone  - man or woman, who has a taste for brilliant literary storytelling."
Year of Wonders,0142001430,Geraldine Brooks,Barnes and Noble,4,review4U,I am innately suspicious of any historical novel with a woman on the cover. If you are looking for the sort of escapism found in a bodice ripper you are in for a disappointment. It is a well researched literary novel that only sags into sappy sentimentality a few times towards the end. Women are the majority of literary fiction readers. Yet 'Year of Wonders' escapes being a classic 'woman's' novel despite the fact that the main protagonist is a strong woman. Because of its interesting historical detail and plot it may even be of interest to some very enlightened men. It reminded me of Arthur Miller's play 'The Crucible' and some of the other fiction about the Salem witch hunt. It seems like a very good choice for book clubs as it raises some good questions. Enjoy.
"The Black Echo (Harry Bosch, #1; Harry Bosch Universe, #1)",0446612731,Michael Connelly,Barnes and Noble,3.8,ashoubre,"This is the first book of the thrilling Harry Bosch Series. Although this book isn't my favorite of the series, it really sets you up and helps you get to know Harry and how he operates. Michael Connely is a fantastic writer who gets better and better with each book he writes! This series gets your heart pounding as Harry Bosch gets closer and closer to the killer. When the book is over, only then will you realize you were holding your breath the whole time, and you won't be able to wait to pick up the next in the series. 

If you are planning to read this series I suggest that you go to Michael Connelly's web site and get a list of all his books. He also has the Terry McCaleb, Jack McEvoy, Rachel Walling and Mickey Haller series that all intertwine with the Harry Bosch series. I recommend that you read the books in the order they were written because it lets you get to know and understand these characters as they will all come into contact and have relations with Harry Bocsh in the following books. Enjoy!"
"The Black Echo (Harry Bosch, #1; Harry Bosch Universe, #1)",0446612731,Michael Connelly,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Whomever,"This is my third Connelly book,but first of the Harry Bosch series I have read.It turns out this is the first of the Bosch series Connelly wrote.I've really enjoyed all three books so far and look forward to many more.

   While it is true this book contains many of the common cliches of crime novels,as other reviewers have stated,they don't take away from the readers enjoyment of this book.The story and characters still come off as believable.The occasional element of humor throughout the book makes it all the more enjoyable.The scene when Harry handcuffs the two internal affairs officers to the tree had me laughing out loud.All in all a good page turner."

I enjoyed the read, especially after reading a dreary cheap Nook book. I have already bought the second Harry Bosch book, Black Ice, and look forward to getting into that!"
Anthem,0452281253,Ayn Rand,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"ANTHEM is a moving novel that makes you think about everything around you. Ayn Rand shows the reader a completely different world. That doesn't know the word I they only know we and they always think of the greater good. It especially makes you think about your freedoms and rights. Equality 7-2521 is an example of a person without rights or freedom in a world where everyone is equal and a few select people are allowed to think and use their creativity. 
The setting in the novel is in a world where there is no technology. Equality is a street sweeper who isn't allowed to you his intellectual abilities. When cleaning one day Equality finds a tunnel and in this tunnel are a light bulb and a circuit breaker which have electricity. Equality then feels like he has discovered something that the world has never known about. Ayn Rand uses this because it is the privilege in which we take most advantage of and she shows use a world without electricity. Can you imagine a world without electricity? No computer, television, air conditioning, and most importantly no lights. Just like in the novel where they have no lights instead they use candles because in their society lights are banned. 
Another event that changes the story is when Equality and the Golden One (the girl he falls in love with) find the vacant house in the Forbidden Forest. This house is special to the story because it is filled with modern day amenities such as lights, beds, bathrooms, and other things that we take for granted. The largest impact of this house is that she points out the flaws of society and how we have so much that we don't need or even waste. But in the house Equality finds things that are left from the society that we have today and he learns to be able to think and try things and even have ideas of his own.
 When Equality is reading a book in the house he finds a word that he had never heard or seen before and it's the word I. Which to us doesn't seem like much but in a world where there is no ""I"" and everything is ""we"" it is a big deal. 
After learning this word he starts to realize its power and how it helps people and life grow, so he decides to start a new life with the Golden One and in this new society everyone will know the power of the word I."
Anthem,0452281253,Ayn Rand,Barnes and Noble,4,Susie_Derkins,"Some people find the society Ayn Rand creates in Anthem to be extreme.  That being said, one must consider the perspective of a teenage girl in Soviet Russia whose father's pharmacy was taken by the communist government.  The notion that everything belongs to the collective ""We"" and that one exists solely for the good of the state would surely lead to intense feelings of helplessness, anger, and frustration.  Hence, Anthem.  Told through the eyes of Equality 7-2521 in a society where there literally is no I in Team, the hero attempts to break from the herd and discover what once was, fueled by the mystery of the Unspeakable Word.  An interesting choice for book groups!"

"Gabriel's Inferno (Gabriel's Inferno, #1)",1936305623,Sylvain Reynard,Barnes and Noble,4.2,skyla11377,"OMG, this book was beyond AMAZING. When I was told how fantastic this book was I was skeptical because you just never know. I read the blurb and I was interested. When I started reading it I so know what my friend meant. I had such a hard time putting it down. I was so desperate to keep reading it that when I was at my 3 year old niece's birthday party I pulled out my iPod so I could keep reading it. THAT is how HOOKED I was....LOL. Gabriel's Inferno is so hard to put into words because I am having a hard time trying to make you all understand just how much this book is A MUST READ. My friend described it as EPIC and I can't tell you how much I agree with her. Gabriel is such a complex character that, at first, you want to write him off as a BIG TIME jerk but upon further inspection you realize he is just an extremely self-tortured soul. I say self-tortured because Gabriel doesn't allow himself any room for forgiveness, therefore, he is always consumed by what he perceives to be a nonredeemable soul. Julianne, is just a young girl at heart, with a crush that never went away but she is also a woman with, what she believes, to be a shameful secret. Julia has loved Gabriel since the first time she ever saw him, but circumstances beyond either of their control has kept them apart for 6 years. When Julia comes face to face with her secret crush she is devastated to realize he doesn't even remember who she is, let alone what she means to his family. Gabriel, for his part, is almost blind to what is right in front of him. To him, miss Mitchell is, nothing more than a bothersome grad student who happens to be in his Dante Seminar class. BUT, the more time he spends around her the more he starts to feel things he never thought possible.  When he learns that Julia is his long lost ""Beatrice"", Gabriel pulls out all the stops to make Julianne see how much they belong together. Even though both character's are struggling with their own inner turmoil they are determined to not let the other one see for fear that it will ruin their fragile serenity. Julia's innocence and Gabriel's jaded past is what makes these two such captivating characters. This book is PHENOMENAL, I  can't stress that enough. To me, this series (yes, there is going to be a book 2) is right up there with The Twilight Saga and The Harry Potter Series (in my humble opinion). On a scale from 1-10 I give Gabriel's Inferno a 20. Yes, it is off the scale because this book is just that incredible. I can't think up enough creative words to say how amazing this book is. Everyone needs to pick up a copy of this book."
"Gabriel's Inferno (Gabriel's Inferno, #1)",1936305623,Sylvain Reynard,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Elletee,"Sylvain Reynard's writing is like no other I have ever experienced.  A sense of hope, together with his wisdom and kindness shine through each chapter as this beautiful romantic love story unfolds. This is a journey where I have learned to appreciate poetry, art, music and literature.  The characters have become loved friends who I care about deeply and want good things to happen to.  Thank you SR. Just thank you."
"Gabriel's Inferno (Gabriel's Inferno, #1)",1936305623,Sylvain Reynard,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Cecita,"If you are looking for a follow-up book, this one it is not. It started strong; seemed like there would be a lot of content. But then...fell flat. The hero changes his personality overnight. There were some good moments, definitely, but not enought to sit through the whole book. You will be particularly disappointed if you are looking for hot sex scenes. Let me tell you, you wait a VERY long time for it and it is so uncomfortable to read! May I also add, the whole virgin storyline got old quick. Yes, the heroine is a virgin. I don't want to hear about it for 200 pages! And how he will be her first...ugh! To sum up, it had potential, not awful but it didn't deliver."

	This story starts off with a grandfather who tells his grandchildren about a town called Chewandswollow. This looks like any other town at first glance, but there are no grocery stores and restaurants have no kitchen. This town has crazy weather 3 times a day at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It rains eggs and bacon or hamburgers every kind of food one can think of.  Life in this town was wonderful for the  people until one day it took turn for the worse. During one of the meals the food started to get bigger and bigger. It started to crush cars and buildings. A giant pancake fell on the school so children could not attend. Food that didn't go together stared to fall. They were in the middle of a huge food storm. The town's people didn't know what to do should they stay or should they evacuate their beloved town. And how should the leave their town of Chewandswollow. Read this book and see what happens to this town you won't be sorry.
	This is a great fun story for children of any age.  It has great and colorful illustrations that all children will enjoy. This book could be used for in class activities from kindergarten to 5th grade. This book would be a great to do a whole unit plan on. One suggestion is a lesson on food groups students can learn about the different food groups and see how many of those food groups were represented in the story. Another lesson can be done on. Another good lesson would be on weather.  Students can learn about the different types of weather factors associated with the types of weather and they can predict the weather for the next week. These are just a few suggestions of lessons for this book but the possibilities are endless."
Major Pettigrew's Last Stand,1400068932,Helen Simonson,Barnes and Noble,4,Frisbeesage,"What a fabulous book! I fell in love with Major Pettigrew from the start. He is so gentle and dryly humorous, willing to own his faults, humble and yet completely fallible and human. When he falls in love with Mrs. Ali, the Pakistani shopkeeper in their small English village, he does it wholeheartedly. Yet their relatives and neighbors disapprove and they have to fight racism, ignorance, and censure to stay together. The author, Helen Simonson, does a great job of addressing nasty issues with a light and gentle hand. The Major struggles with what his beliefs confronting religion, environmentalism, and racism with his wisdom and humor. The plot is fast-paced and interesting making this a real page turner with a surprising twist at the end. A fun, heartwarming book that nevertheless examines some serious social issues."
Major Pettigrew's Last Stand,1400068932,Helen Simonson,Barnes and Noble,4,1louise1,"An older, distinguished gentlemen expanding his friendship with a mature lady friend in the English countrywide, is a beautiful unconventional love story, wry and witty, frequently hilarious. GREAT HUMAN SPIRIT AND FEEL GOOD READ! I loved it!"
Major Pettigrew's Last Stand,1400068932,Helen Simonson,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"Helen Simonson's 'Major Pettigrew's Last Stand' is a novel of love and grief and family and relationships. And while the fact that the major characters are fifty plus may be beside the point, it is nevertheless refreshing to see that the aged and aging may have real lives.

Widower Major Ernest Pettigrew, veteran of Her Majesty's Service and stanch upholder of all things British, is attracted to Jasmina Ali, the Pakistani matron who runs the village shop. No reader will be surprised that the members of the Major's golf club aren't impressed by his choice nor is Jasmina's family pleased that she has a British suitor. Ernest is expected to marry the local spinster (after a little not too genteel nudging by the ladies circle) and Jasmina's in-laws are expecting her to relinquish her shop to her nephew and 'retire' to the safety and servitude of family obligation. 

However, this is less a story of plot than character. And Simonson does an excellent job of rendering each of her characters - from the upright and moral major and his sometimes greedy and consistently unsure son Roger with his flip yet sympathetic American girlfriend to the lovely and wise Jasmina and her serious, scholarly, and equally greedy and unsure nephew Abdul - with great depth and flair.

Five Stars: Recommended for all readers who want to be reminded of the cost and power of love and who want to smile as they close the book at the end."
"Vision in White (Bride Quartet, #1)",0425227510,Nora Roberts,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,I think it's pretty low that you can buy the paperback for $3 cheaper than the e-book. I love my nook but i'm starting to wonder if im getting ripped-off. Will not read these books for that reason!

The Tenth Circle,074349671X,Jodi Picoult,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Guest,"Jodi Picoult's THE TENTH CIRCLE verges on genius for a new literary style to add to her tight rope walking ideas that she always presents in her books.  Her new book is 10% cartoon book which covers all the intricacies of Dante's Inferno with the wonderful style of the adult superhero cartoonest. Once again she presents a book that is a must do for all reading groups.  What would we be willing to do for our child? Do we have any control over our darker, vengeful sides?  Can we learn from mistakes and become better people? Are human being redeemable?  Parental angst for the life styles of our teenagers is played out extremely well in this very compelling story line.  I would recommend that anyone who has not not found Jodi Picoult should go right out and pick up all thirteen of her easy reading, thought provoking, timely issues books.  A superhero winner, Jodi Pidoult!!"

I stumbled apon it in the airport on one of my journeys across the country the last summer. The book was marveing and i found it to be so interesting that i couldn't put it down. The story of John Perry giving up his 'old' body for a new military green one to fight for the CDF. As the book moves on you will became attached to the characters as they went on missions against alien species bent on destruction of mankind and the aquisition of planets that bare natural resources. I won't tell about the book because it would give away the book, but i will tell you that if your a sci-fi/action&adventure lover that this book is definently for you! Be warned that this book and the sequels to this book(The Ghost Bridgades, The last Colony) are extreme in detail to violence/gore and love/sex.    But all in all one of my favorites along with the sequels.                !!!Enjoy Them!!!"

With nothing to keep him here, John abruptly decides to join the Colonial Defense Force struggling to defend or annex other worlds in deadly competition with alien races for control of the few hospitable planets.......................    As a recruit, John receives standard gear to include a much younger healthier body that is beyond the ability of most non government citizens to buy except the affluent.  Like his brothers and sisters in arms, he bonds with them as they are his family and his hope to survive one skirmish after another in many cases against superior aliens.  As his comrades die and collateral damage devastate civilian population, John begins questioning the worth war that enables a few to economically gain a lot at the cost of others even as he begins to ponder whether he is still human....................    Paying homage to Heinlein (Starship Trooper the book not the movie), John Scalzi provides a tense anti-war military science fiction thriller that will leave fans pondering what is war good for.  Readers will also wonder about who benefits from scientific advances and military operations and what actually a human is as science changes Homo sapiens.

Gerald's Game,0831727527,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,3.8,JessLucy,"Super scary and disturbing novel! This book starts out with a husband and wife at their cabin in a remote location. What started as sexy fun and games quickly turns terrifying. I was mad at King about the how the issue of the stray dog was resolved; he didn't do anything wrong! Anyway, this book truly scared me...after reading it one night I woke up in the early hours to use the bathroom and I was so spooked I made my German Shepherd come to the bathroom with me! I couldn't believe the ending; King really surprised me with this one! I would also recommend: The Stand, The Dark Tower Series (especially Wizard and Glass), Needful Things, and The Eye of The Dragon. You may also like the novels of Dean Koontz, especially the older ones (Whispers, Watchers, Night Chills, Phantoms, and Cold Fire)."
Gerald's Game,0831727527,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Anonymous,"This is the kind of Stephen King novel I absolutely love. Gerald's Game is a story of psychological horror, with the merest hint of something supernatural (or not) only at the very periphery of the story. At the heart of this story, however, are the very real horrors of this world, particularly the ones from our past that continue to haunt us in very real (albeit unconscious ways). This book stands alongside Cujo, Misery, and the early Bachman books to name but a few. This is where Stephan King excels. He knows what scares us, and this one is truly frightening."
Gerald's Game,0831727527,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Sean_Patrick_R,"Without spoiling anything from the story, and making this long, I can only say this is a book that makes me question the mind of the author. Simply to think all of this up and put it down in writing is absolutely scary. Partially from what happens before the Main Character and her Father, the way her entire ordeal is handled, and I guess just every aspect of it. 

I have always been aware that Stephen King is an amazing writer. Now I am starting to realize just how creative he can be. You'll feel chained up in the room with her."
"The Forever War (The Forever War, #1)",0060510862,Joe Haldeman,Barnes and Noble,4.3,DominicMichael,"The year is 1997, and mankind is locked in a cosmic war with an enemy it's never seen.  First, let's set the stage: twelve years before, scientists discovered the collapsar jumps, naturally occurring wormholes that allow instantaneous access to the stars.  Fly in one end at just the right angle, at just the right speed, and pop out at some distant corner of space.  What roads were to Rome and ships were to the British, so now are collapsars to Earth.  Whoever controls them rules the known galaxy-and it seems other intelligent beings besides those on Earth understand this simple fact, as well.

So begins The Forever War, a novel chronicling the story of elite soldier William Mandella through humanity's conflict with an alien race known as the Tauran.  The author, Joe Haldeman, accomplishes a feat with his first novel that doesn't seem possible.  He's written an epic adventure story in less than three hundred pages.  What's more, the world he creates is so believable that after a short while, you don't even question the techno jargon anymore.  Instead, you find yourself blindly accepting all the rules and also thinking of new ways to fight with the tools at hand.  This complete immersion into a foreign reality is one the book's greatest strengths, and lays a strong foundation that seems to be missing in a lot of modern sci-fi.  It's refreshing to see science as the cornerstone for science fiction.  The author obviously had schooling in some of these areas to handle them so convincingly.  And if he didn't, he sure fakes it damned well.

At its heart, though, The Forever War is a war story.  ""Tonight,"" begins the first chapter, ""we're going to show you eight silent ways to kill a man.""  It soon becomes clear that the 'actors' in the demonstration video are convicted criminals who are actually being executed for the sake of teaching new recruits how to kill a man with a kidney punch.  Cute.  There's little outrage among the men and women, though, which is a hint at what kind of world you're entering.  This is a world where men and women are forcibly conscripted into an organization called the United Nations Exploratory Force, or UNEF, and sent into battle.  This is a world were 50% casualty rates simply during training are the norm, not the exception.  This is a world where your superiors fire live ordinance at you during drills and execute you for insubordination.  This is a brutal world.  Accept that going in.

It's this inhumanity, though, that truly gives The Forever War its soul.  Haldeman, based on his own real life experience in Vietnam, gives us a front row seat to the savagery of war and the lengths unchecked bureaucracies are willing to go in order to 'win.'  His subtle, concise writing style adds to a gripping narrative that conveys the power of his themes without patronizing the reader by banging them over the head with a proverbial shovel.  This is a story that truly gives the reader an honest impression of what armed conflict is really like, minus all the glitz and glitter and rhetoric.  In these uncertain times, with America engaged in places like Iraq, it reminds you why war is always the option of last resort.

"The Forever War (The Forever War, #1)",0060510862,Joe Haldeman,Barnes and Noble,4.3,RJ45,"This is quite possibly the best book I have ever read.  I say this having read the book back in high school, and then having reread it several time since.  Joe Haldeman very effectively tells a story that takes place in the future yet speaks to a modern world where soldiers fight in wars that they don't really care about using skills that are largely alien to their basic personalities.  These same soldiers then come home to a world that has seemingly changed (in the book, the world really has changed) and must choose to live in that world, or go back to do what they detest."
"The Forever War (The Forever War, #1)",0060510862,Joe Haldeman,Barnes and Noble,4.3,JCarter,"Originally published before Star Wars, this work is based on science fact. Man is unable to go faster than light speed, time moves forward on Earth but not for those in space. These things lead to soldiers fighting a war lasting thousands of years on Earth and only a few years where they are.
     Civilization on Earth evolves beyond what soldiers on the front can grasp. but beyond that are still the horrors that soldiers face in battle.

     For me this is the definitive science fiction work. Having written Mr. Joe Haldeman several times he had given me the inspiration to write science fiction and the encouragement to do so. I would place this book alongside Red Badge of Courage."

"The Arctic Incident (Artemis Fowl, #2)",0786851473,Eoin Colfer,Barnes and Noble,4.4,TeensReadToo,"I didn't discover the delight that is the Artemis Fowl series until a week ago, when I read ARTEMIS FOWL in one day. So, of course, I had to pick up a copy of THE ARCTIC INCIDENT right away, to see if it was as good as the first. It definitely is, and in my own humble opinion, I think I liked it even better than the first book. There are points throughout the book where Artemis, now thirteen, shows a softer, more vulnerable side that I truly enjoyed. Don't get me wrong, he's still an evil genius, but he's an evil genius with heart, and you can't help but love him. Now that Angeline Fowl is out of her depression, thanks to some fairy magic from Captain Holly Short, she's sent Artemis back to Saint Bartelby's School for Young Gentlemen in Ireland. Artemis is having quite a large amount of fun flumoxing the school's counselor, Dr. Po, when he gets an urgent message from Butler, his bodyguard/butler/majordomo--it seems that Artemis Fowl the First is alive in Russia, being held for ransom by the Russian Mafiya. Young Artemis, of course, immediately sets out to devise a scheme to rescue his father. It's been almost two years since Artemis Senior was last heard from, and his son is most eager to bring him home. Before he can work out a devious scheme, though, he's visited by none other than Captain Short and her superior, Commander Root, and brought down to Haven City and into Police Plaza. It seems the goblin triad, the B'Wa Kell, have a human counterpart aiding in their smuggling, and Artemis the Second is, quite justly I believe, suspected of being that human. The fairies soon realize, however, that this time Artemis Fowl isn't the bad guy in this problem. But now they'd like Artemis and Butler's help in figuring out who is behind the allaince between the goblins and the Mud Men--and Artemis is quite willing to help them out, in exchange for the fairies help in rescuing his father. What follows is an action-packed story of good versus evil below ground, with deceptions, backstabbing, and revenge taking center stage. As Holly, Root, Butler, and Artemis race to save Haven City from being destroyed, some of the same characters from the first book make appearances--Foaly, Mulch Diggums, Cudgeon, and Captain Trouble. There's also a new foe in THE ARCTIC INCIDENT, Opal Koboi, to be dealt with. I highly recommend the ARTEMIS FOWL series to anyone and everyone. Highly enjoyable, thoroughly entertaining, and not soon forgotten."
"The Arctic Incident (Artemis Fowl, #2)",0786851473,Eoin Colfer,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,Eoin Colfer has enlightened me with another one of his amazing novels. My heart was pounding with excitement by the 3rd chapter. i highly recommend the entire a.f. series.
"The Arctic Incident (Artemis Fowl, #2)",0786851473,Eoin Colfer,Barnes and Noble,4.4,bookfreak54,"A year ago the child prot&#233;g&#233; Artemis Fowl took on the fairy underworld in a plot to restore his family fortune. This plot put the lives of his mother, his bodyguard, and all that was dear to him. But that was then and this is now. Artemis is a year older and has promise to go on the strait and narrow. He enrolled in one of Ireland's most premier colleges and now uses his talents to drive the psychologist to the brink of insanity. He almost put his greatest secrets behind him. The fairy people. He almost became normal. Well, as normal as a thirteen year old genius can be. But things don't stay the same for long. 

But one email is all it takes. It acted like a drop of water on a still pond. A simple email sent ripples in the once calm waters of his life. His father had been found. But getting would be no easy task. The Russian Mafia had gotten to him. At the same time the LEP (a fairy police unit) was doing a routine check-up on an abandon tunnel when they were attacked by goblins armed with illegal weapons. But that's not the bad part. They were powered by human batteries. So they naturally assumed that it was the only human who knew about the People's existence, Artemis Fowl.

The fairy people capture Artemis and his massive bodyguard named Butler and takes them underground for a typical police integration. They find him innocent but are left with a problem; whose behind this. Artemis decides to help them; but there's a catch. He wants their help getting his father back. After a major break in the case they send Butler to France to investigate a suspect. While Butler is in France they trace the email and get everything ready to go. In Russia everything goes wrong and when they go back underground everything's different. 

This amazing work of literary art is well written and will capture the imaginations of readers young and old. It is a captivating book for readers of all ages. You will be drawn into the story by the truly unique writing style of The New York Times Best-selling author Eoin Colfer. This book is full of twists and turns from the beginning to end. Even some of the most hard to please and easily board reader will be delighted by this masterpiece. And if you're very lucky you may find some similarities between you and him. Will Artemis save his father; read the book to find out."
The Shipping News,0743225422,Annie Proulx,Barnes and Noble,3.7,kimdep,"This is the story of Quoyle.. who is always the foil.. he was treated badly growing up, was severely emotionally abused throughout his marriage to a whorish nymphomaniac, and repeatedly got fired from his dead end job. So when his aunt suggests they move to Newfoundaland he picks up his children .. Bunny & Sunshine (love their names).. and moves. 

In Newfoundland he is re-created. He becomes successful at his job. He is respected by others. The town has it's own quirkiness so he & the family fit in well.

I liked the story a lot. To me it really reflects how our roots affect us in ways we don't even realize. I think it's really cool when a character discovers things about themselves through digging into their ancestry. The writing style is quick and easy to read. The dialogue is engaging as the town people speak with their unique accent. I enjoyed reading this story of self-discovery."
The Shipping News,0743225422,Annie Proulx,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Anonymous,"I can't imagine anyone not placing this book at the top of their Must Read list. The characters are real - not grand in stature - but so like the rest of us - not pretty, struggling, abandoned, but filled with a great desire to find a life. As a former newspaper woman, I especially like the way our hero narrows everything down to alliterative headlines. How could you not howl when the entire family is confined to a single motel room and the dog is farting up a storm in its sleep: Farts Fell Family of Four. You've got to love it."

The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing,1607747308,"Marie Kondō, Cathy Hirano",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Lterry27,"I have read more organizing and minimalist books than I would like to admit. And while they all inspired me in different ways, I was still unable to clear out and clean up the years of accumulation and clutter. This book is a gem. It changed me. Kondo's method is so simple. No algorithms for determining what stays and goes, no investments in complex organization. I could write out the basics of her system here, but boiled down to the basics is not where the value lies - it's the journey through the book that makes all the difference.  I will always be grateful I came across this title.  I will likely never read another book about organizing again, it's that good. Highly, highly recommend for anyone interested in this topic."

I've always been. I picked up this book on a whim, expecting nothing. Turns out it actually helped. It took an entire day just to clean my room, but it's been 2 weeks and there hasn't been a huge mess since. Cleaning was such a hassle, and granted, old habits die hard, but I can feel myself becoming more and more organized. There's a completely different vibe radiating from my bedroom. I don't feel trapped, weighed down, or heavy here anymore. It's an amazing feeling. I shared the book's tips with my younger sister and she's also benefited greatly. Highly recommended."

    I wanted to read All the Bright Places because I am always interested in mental health books, especially ones dealing with suicide. As someone who has mental health issues, has had thoughts of suicide myself, and lost my father to suicide, it is a topic that is very important to me. I think that books like this can help people relate to someone who is depressed or thinking of suicide even if they have never had clinical depression, 




    In a society where everything is becoming all about instant gratification and what feels good in that moment, it is important to realistically address what happens when moods get dark and it feels like there is no way out. I think that it is important to learn how to love people that are in that situation and
 even if they are not normally your friend, if you see someone hurting, talk to them, be their friend, and it may make all of the difference in the world to them. It is also crucial to look at the times where a person may go through with suicide. Blame cannot be placed, you can't ask the what ifs and you have to learn how to let their memory be honored and stay alive and heal and keep living however you can. 




    All the Bright Places is smart shocking realistic and messy emotional. No holds barred with finch. He was the kind of character who amazed me at his kindness and broke my heart. I loved that he could help someone else and talk them down when he himself can't quit thinking about death and how it could be his escape. But he is also a person who lived life fully. He didn't conform to expectations and tried to see the beauty in life and take risks, chances and life hard. 




   Our other main character is Violet. Where I can connect with Finch on some levels, and admired him where I didn't understand or that wasn't my personality, I connected with Violet in others. She is a people pleaser, she is more withdrawn, and she is hurting deep inside, and tries to keep it hidden. The healing and growth on violet was undeniable watching her learn to accept loss and still remember and love those that have left her life was inspiring.  




     Finch is eccentric and troubled but also with a love for life even with thoughts of and plans for suicide torment him. Their reluctant friendship and camaraderie in meeting on that water tower, and Finch talking her down and not thinking less or correcting when people thought that it was Violet who saved Finch. He is persistent in being around her and trying to bring her out of her shell. They both have a lot to teach the other. 




    The ending is bold and raw. I couldn't believe the route that it took but think that it is eye opening and realistic. Not everything can be a happy ending, there are aspects to mental health that can't be fixed, and there is some pain that is inescapable. But I do like the hope that it does give us. That there are other ways, there is help out there, and there are friends in places we may never have thought to look. 








Bottom Line: Gritty, raw, emotional, powerful."
All the Bright Places,0385755880,"Jennifer Niven, فرانک معنوی",Barnes and Noble,4.7,KikiD870,"This book was... amazing.  For heart wrenching novels, this is right up there with The Fault in Our Stars and Love and Other Unknown Variable, two of my favorite novels of 2014.  It touches the soul, it touches the heart, and leaves you reeling.  I started it in the morning and didn't put it down again until I had finished it.  And then I sat there drained.  It was so beautiful in its own way.  I love that this book recognizes that happy ever afters don't always happen in life.  Life is messy, sad, funny, loving, and every emotion in between.  There is love and there is loss.

Theo is the guy that no one really understands, including himself.  Even his two best friends seem to know him only on the most basic of levels.  His family is largely a group of people living separate lives and I frequently thought that his little sister Decca was the most together of them all.  He has had a pretty troubled past and he struggles to figure out who he is.  Violet is the, on the surface, the popular girl with the &quot;right&quot; friends and the &quot;right&quot; boyfriend.  Inside, she is a mess, struggling to survive after losing her sister, her best friend.  She doesn't know how to move on, bogged down in her grief.  The two meet in the worst possible moment, two people who are seemingly totally different.  Yet they are drawn to each other and their story is beautiful.

There is so much depth to this story.  Yes, there are heart wrenchingly sad moments, but there are beautiful ones, too.  There is a ton of unexpected and witty humor, and so much sweetness from Theo that made him even more amazing.  But there is no denying that Theo's story also made me angry, as a parent.  Without giving too much away, it just angered me to see him as he was through much of the book.  If his parents had just opened their eyes and taken the time to BE parents, his story could have been so very different.  And that drove me insane.

My Recommendation:  This is a beautiful read.   The story is not light, but touches on real issues with compassion.  Not every story has a perfectly happy ending, but there is always a lesson to be learned and that is the case with this incredible novel."
"Déjà Dead (Temperance Brennan, #1)",0671011367,Kathy Reichs,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"I have to start by saying that I came to this book by way of the TV show Bones.  I love the quirky characters in the show and was hoping that the book's Temperance Brennan would be the same as the show's.  As it turns out, they have nothing to do with each other.  If you're hoping for the show, don't pick up this book.  If you want a good murder mystery, then this is a pretty good one.  The characters are fairly realistic.  The forensics appear spot on.  The French phrases do get annoying, though.  And WHY do authors always have the main character do really stupid things (like go into bad neighborhoods alone in the middle of the night)?  The ending was appropriate and didn't feel rushed.  I would recommend this book to mystery lovers, but I don't think I'll be reading another one of hers."

The Marriage Plot,0374203059,Jeffrey Eugenides,Barnes and Noble,3.4,SusanDavis7699,"At least lately.  Without giving too much away, this book and its characters were amazingly well-written.

The Marriage Plot,0374203059,Jeffrey Eugenides,Barnes and Noble,3.4,MsReadalotIL,"I have attempted to post a negative review for this book three times and am not sure why it is not being accepted.  Jeffrey Eugenides is an extremely talented writer and Middlesex is one of the best pieces of modern fiction I have ever read.  This book, which I highly anticipated, is awful by comparison. The characters are a bunch of whiny,self-centered college students who don't mature by the end of the book. Even the most sympathetic character, Mitchell, grated on me.  So one of the main characters suffers from manic-depression---it really doesn't add much weight to the story other than the reason for the self-absorbed female protagonist to skip her graduation.  I was horribly dissatisfied by this book.  If I could give zero stars on this site, I would."
Daughter of Fortune,0061120251,"Isabel Allende, Margaret Sayers Peden",Barnes and Noble,4,Joan-Gareth,"When I first read its synopsis three years ago, I was immediately drawn to what seemed to be a puzzling storyline. How can a young girl from Chile arrive in California, especially in the 1800's during the Gold Rush? The summary read ""because of love,"" but in reality, what can love really accomplish?
The first half or so of the book gives no mention of California until young Eliza Sommers, raised by wealthy owners of an English import/export company in Chile, falls in love with Joaquin Andieta. It is no coincidence that Joaquin and Eliza meet at the time right before the California Gold Rush fever reaches Valparaiso, Chile. Eliza's loneliness and her sense of pride driver her to follow her lover to California and find him, even recruiting the help of a Chinese man whom she knows little about. Armed with only the pearls and golden jewelry her uncle Captain John Sommers has collected for her over the years, she leaves for California and experiences suffering and hardship, both which make her realize that life is too short-lived and it would be impossible for her to return to the proper world of corsets and milky skin. Over time, she even begins forgetting her lover's identity, clinging to their love letters as she tries to overcome the desperation time imbues in her. Driven by legend and a shell of lost romance, Eliza must eventually decide for herself whether or not to forget the past.
The characters themselves are colorful and well-developed. There are chapters in the book devoted to almost every one of them, and Isabel Allende does a wonderful job at developing their history. This significantly builds their development as their attitudes and decisions are driven by their past, and no little detail goes unnoticed. From the stage of the dramatic Italian/English theater to the crowded and buzzing streets of Hong Kong, Allende CREATES a believable world and portrays the characters in a higher dimension. Allende demonstrates a savvy for almost every type of culture, and that knowledge shines through to create a higher level of drama rarely achieved by other authors. As she explains each character, the reader is able to understand them deeply and thus creates a bond between character and reader, enhancing readability.
""Daughter of Fortune"" is an excellent book, and once picked up, it is difficult to put down. Each page is full of imagery, full of choices, and full of a world nobody remembers and few have seen. I highly recommend reading this novel: A tale about a young girl who is willing to lose it all for something she herself lost."
Daughter of Fortune,0061120251,"Isabel Allende, Margaret Sayers Peden",Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"The book Daughter of Fortune by Isabel Allende is an extremely engaging and colorful novel. It spans several generations and explores the effects and difficulties of unrequited love. I especially enjoyed the author's wonderful imagery which creates a much more vivid and intimate connection for the reader. Allende's personal ties to the setting in Chile make the description exceptionally powerful. The book incorporates accurate facts and details of the time to make this fiction story seem like reality. Allende uses actual dates and events to verify her plot and places her characters in a historically important background. This setting is not only essential to the plot but to themes as well which touch on the role and view of women in society during this particular time period. 
 The characters are very well characterized and developed, adding to the thrilling story-line. Early on, the reader is able to form a connection with these characters because of their aspirations for the future. The struggles that they overcome and the adversity that they face are very easy for the reader to identify with. The story is focused primarily on the protagonist, Eliza, however, the other supporting characters full of depth and life. Eliza is strong, independent and full of vigor and her undeterred spirit is a driving force in the novel. She is an exceptional example of a woman, escaping the boundaries of her time, by establishing herself as controller of her own fate and destiny. 
This novel would be enjoyed by anyone who enjoys historical fiction with an intriguing plot."
Daughter of Fortune,0061120251,"Isabel Allende, Margaret Sayers Peden",Barnes and Noble,4,SeriousGrace on LibraryThing,"Daughter of Fortune is the didactic tale of what happens when you become so obsessed with a thought, a feeling that you carry the obsession long after you remember why or what it was all about. This is the complicated saga of Eliza Sommers, raised as an orphan by a Victorian brother and sister - strict and unfeeling Jeremy and his spinster sister Rose. Secrets abound in Daughter of Fortune. When Eliza falls in love with delivery boy Joaquin Andieta her whole life changes. An obsession to be his ""slave"" claims her and compels her to follow him from Valparasio, Chile to California during the gold rush of 1849."
Luckiest Girl Alive,1476789630,Jessica Knoll,Barnes and Noble,3.7,KDH_Reviews,"I admit it. The sole reason I requested this book from Netgalley was the comparison to Gone Girl. I love that book. I love it hardcore. Yes, I know that a lot of times comparisons are unjustified and generally leave you feeling very disappointed. However, I had to take the chance. While I thoroughly enjoyed this book, I wouldn't compare it to Gone Girl (though I suppose I can see the similarities).

Luckiest Girl Alive is a solid book. It captured and held my attention from the very beginning. This book needed my attention. I just had to keep reading and find out what happened. I kept waiting for the BIG twist, the huge reveal... and it just never came. Yes, there is a twist or two. That's true. However, nothing hit me like I expected. I think that says more about my expectations, though, than the book itself. Especially since I stayed fully engaged and interested in the story throughout the book.

Though not comparable to Gone Girl by my standards, this is definitely still a winner. It's a fantastic book that I'm sure many will enjoy.

Luckiest Girl Alive,1476789630,Jessica Knoll,Barnes and Noble,3.7,BrandieC,"2.5 stars

I clearly am living on a different planet from the editors of Good Housekeeping and all the other reviewers who have favorably compared Jessica Knoll's Luckiest Girl Alive to Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl. I loved Gone Girl, but I found Luckiest Girl Alive so slow and uninteresting (at least for the first 11 chapters, which take up almost two-thirds of the book) that I would have given up on it had I not committed to review it.

Once Knoll turned her attention from the minutiae of Ani's impending society wedding to the hackneyed &quot;chilling and violent incident&quot; which occurred when Ani was a teenager, her story gained some momentum, but Knoll never adequately integrated these experiences into Ani's adult persona so as to explain her present-day actions. On the very first page of the book, for example, Ani fantasizes about stabbing her fianc&eacute; in the stomach while they are shopping for kitchen knives, yet nothing we learn about her past (or, for that matter, her fianc&eacute;'s behavior) accounts for this. Ani remains shallow, self-centered, and unlikeable from start to finish, without any hint of the cleverness which made Flynn's anti-heroine so fascinating.

The story is fantastic and I may only be a sixteen year old, but when it comes to reading I am extremely picky. I read this book in less then a day. I couldn't put it down. I read it in class, through the halls, on the bus. It followed me everywhere the day I got it from my library."
"Crank (Crank, #1)",0689865198,Ellen Hopkins,Barnes and Noble,4.6,JESSZAMBRANO,"There are no words to describe this book.
I think every teenager should read this. It's honest and brutal and really describes the horrors of the addiction without straight up describing it. Through Crank, Ellen Hopkins has created this astoundingly true world that exists right outside my door or yours; almost in a way regardless of age, and there is just no way to truly describe what this book did for me. Even though I've never touched drugs or wanted to, it just seemed to hit. I found myself deeply relating to Kristina, feeling the issues with parents but never saying a word, working to keep that A average, etc. But I also understood the allure of Bree because, no matter how smart a person is, sometimes the desire to just let everything go can start to overpower a person. Even not knowing the feelings and effects in which the drugs instill in Bree, the way Hopkins goes about describing her highs and lows, fall outs and blow ups it makes you feel as if your right in the same state of mind she is in. I also believe that the way in which she actually composed the book, through the short stories/ poems the thickness of the book dissolves much like you do into the pages. The way Hopkins writes about serious subjects like drug abuse and suicide, which make her a frequent target of book banners. One of her most popular books, Crank is based on her own daughter's struggle with drug addiction which leaves more doors open to the thought of ""don't drag myself into something like that"", rather than opening a door to experimenting.
If nothing else, I will continue reading the sequels and every other book by Ellen Hopkins I can get my hands on. Especially since they're not only wondrous, but very quick reads."
"The Raven Boys (The Raven Cycle, #1)",0545424925,Maggie Stiefvater,Barnes and Noble,4.4,majibookshelf,"The Raven Boys is a story that is full of fantasy and supernatural occurrences that actually originate from factual, real life beliefs that I actually looked up after finishing the book. However, with this stellar and rich plot, The Raven Boys has a cast of unique, individualistic characters that you can&rsquo;t help but fall a little bit in love with and also be jealous of their friendship and want to be a part of their posse. Four boys, The Raven Boys, the name given to boys who go to Aglionby, the private school for rich kids, are what the story revolves around, along with Blue, the girl that somehow triggers everything around them. 
I honestly think what landed this book in my top books of 2012 list are the characters, their friendship with each other, and how the four boys, even with their differences and their distinct personalities, mesh so well together and would do anything for each other. Then enters the psychic&rsquo;s daughter, Blue. She&rsquo;s destined to either fall in love or kill one of these four boys, and we find which one at the beginning of the novel. Also, prophecies from all psychics have warned her about kissing the love of her life because with that one kiss, death will do them part. Blue quickly becomes a part of their group and I really liked how there are no lies, deceits, and backstabbing happening between them. 
Blue ends up getting close to someone but who is NOT the Raven Boy we were promised in the synopsis and that our hearts, well at least mine, has been dying to get them together. But I must warn you, if you are expecting romance to be the leading theme, or even the secondary theme, then you are mistaken. The first theme is most definitely the boys&rsquo; obsession with finding out the ley line (click on the link to find out more about Ley Lines) and finding the buried one. The second is the friendship between them and how normal life still gets in the way of their quest to unraveling the supernatural that this world does indeed have. Maggie&rsquo;s writing was so enchanting in The Raven Boys; I was holding my breath in so many scenes. I also somehow became as obsessed as the boys were in trying to find the ley lines. Also, Gansey, one of the boys, has totally stolen my heart. He was like the father of all the boys. He busted their butts when they weren&rsquo;t studying, saved them when they got into fights, and vouched for them when they were going to get kicked out of school or were abused at home. 
If you are not a fan of The Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy, then I still urge you to read The Raven Boys. This book is not in the least bit similar to the Shiver series. I honestly wouldn&rsquo;t have guessed for the life of me that the same author wrote both books. I am so glad Maggie has decided to explore her own fascination in ley lines and create such a powerful and memorable novel that had me yearning to get my hands on the second book when the first hasn&rsquo;t even come out yet!"
"The Raven Boys (The Raven Cycle, #1)",0545424925,Maggie Stiefvater,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Joie-de-Lire,"Let me just start off by making this clear: the synopsis of this book does not do the actual story justice. Not by a long shot.
Yes, Blue is apparently destined to kill her true love with her kiss, and yes, she meets four Raven Boys.

More than that, though, this book is about an eccentric family of secretive psychics and a non-psychic daughter, a journey to find a magical ley line, the legend of the Welsh king, Glendower, and the fierce friendship between four boys that is complex and heart-breakingly beautiful.

The best part of this book, for me, is definitely the friendship between the four Raven Boys.

You've got Gansey who is born with unimaginable privilege and harbors an obsession for finding the legendary Glendower. I loved the dichotomy of Gansey's character! On the surface he is the cookie-cutter rich boy, but beneath that there is this inexplicably complex nature, from his deep insatiable yearning for Glendower to his love and protectiveness of his friends. I wish I knew the right words to describe Gansey, but all I can tell you is that he is a truly unforgettable character. 


&quot;In the end, he was nobody to Adam, he was nobody to Ronan. Adam spit his words back at him and Ronan squandered however many second chances he gave him. Gansey was just a guy with a lot of stuff and a hole inside him that chewed away more of his heart every year.
They were always walking away from him. But he never seemed able to walk away from them.&quot;

Then you've got Adam, sweet and endearing Adam. He's a tortured hero who has been able to retain this rare kindness and gentleness about him despite the hell he grew up in. Adam comes from nothing and, like Gansey, yearns for something more, but he won't accept anything unless he's earned it himself.

&quot;It means I never get to be my own person. If I let you cover for me, then I'm yours. I'm his now, and then I'll be yours.&quot;

Ronan is the bad-boy of the bunch; angry, intimidating, and downright dangerous. However, there is a concealed softer side of him, a side that may not be described as &quot;kind,&quot; but definitely shows that he cares more about people than he seems to. His past is shrouded in mystery and I really cannot wait for the sequel to find out more about him!

&quot;Gansey had once told Adam that he was afraid most people didn't know how to handle Ronan. What he meant by this was that he was worried that one day someone would fall on Ronan and cut themselves.&quot; 

Last, but certainly not least, is Noah, the most mysterious of the four--but just as endearing. Noah harbors a dark secret which plays an integral part in this novel, both in the the mystery of the book and in the relationships between the Raven Boys.

&quot;Noah was a good bellwether for people. He was so shy and awkward and invisible that he could be easily ignored or made fun of.&quot;

These four boys are as different as could be, but they fit together like jigsaw pieces falling into place, balancing each other and keeping each other in check. Their relationship is complicated, but so compelling to read about, and before I could help it, I'd fallen in love with each of them.

I've read Stiefvater's Shiver trilogy and part of her Scorpio Race, and in The Raven Boys, her writing is still effortlessly gorgeous! Her descriptions are so vivid it's really like I'm in Henrietta, Virginia with its hot days, cold nights, and mountain air.

The only frustrating part of this book, for me, was the romance. Or lack thereof. As a romanceaholic, I crave that bit of romance in books and as I was reading this, I was constantly anticipating the emegence of the romantic element....but it never came! Not really. There was a slight blossoming of feelings, but for a story that emphasized how Blue was going to kill her true love, there really wasn't a whole lot of love present.

AND THAT'S OKAY.

Let me repeat: It's okay that there wasn't much romance. I still loved this book regardless. The story, the mystery, and especially the characters drew me in and kept me a willful prisoner for 408 pages.

Rating: 4.5 stars*

All in all: I. Need. The. Sequel.
I need it now! This book captivated me while I read and even when I finished, I could not get the story or the characters out of my head. So the question now is, how many &quot;reallys&quot; do I have to put before &quot;recommend&quot; to get you to read this?

"The Raven Boys (The Raven Cycle, #1)",0545424925,Maggie Stiefvater,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"I truly enjoyed reading this book. Let me just say that there is more to this book than what is explained in the synopsis. I am eagerly awaiting what will follow in their quest. I love the depth of the characters and the ""magic"" that comes alive."
I Am Legend and Other Stories,031286504X,Richard Matheson,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"After seeing the movie, I wanted to know more, so I picked up the book. I discovered this is actually a short story & was totally different than the movie.Like a lot of books, the story starts out in the present. However, Matheson did not delve into the past's details & when he did, it wasn't quite the chronology I was expecting, which sets this novel apart. Also, I think Matheson portrayed the main character wonderfully! I love that he was so rough & flawed, but this also made the character more real to me. I also enjoyed the sporadic dialogue the main character had with HIMSELF. The dialogue kept the book from being monotonous. Thought-provoking read with enough emotional & scientific-based depth to keep me interested. Not a disappointment."

He endures his ordeal through alcohol, but his loneliness is driving him insane as each night he considers giving up until he meets his first non vampire friend since the disease, a dog fearful of him.--------------    This book actually contains a reprint of the 1954 classic novella I AM LEGEND in conjunction with an upcoming movie (note that Vincent Price starred in the 1960s film The Last Man on Earth based on this tale) and ten short stories that are entertaining and well written, but feel like padding to almost double the size of the book.  Readers will understand why some of the great horror writers like Stephen King consider this novella one of the best ever as it crosses science fiction with horror yet holds up well because the bottom line is this is a character study of the human need for companionship as well as a Frankenstein like question as to just who is the monster?-------------    Harriet Klausner"
I Am Legend and Other Stories,031286504X,Richard Matheson,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Vivian_Metzger,"There were some things I really loved about I Am Legend. First, it is number one on my list for most scientific books about vampires I have ever read. I was surprised to see the book was very different from the Will Smith movie, but I loved this version too. The thing I liked most about the novel (especially compared to the movie) was the ending. The events of the ending portion of I Am Legend really came out of left field for me. I wasn't expecting what happened, at all. It is very much the most important part of the novel. It leaves us with a message, questioning what we have known and what we believe. I thought it was poignant and powerful, and it certainly left me thinking.

A superb book, filled with such powerful emotions when pondering the existence of humans.

Yes, this book is Legend."
Olive Kitteridge,140006208X,Elizabeth Strout,Barnes and Noble,3.7,emmi331,"Elizabeth Strout has crafted a series of short stories revolving around Olive Kitteridge, a retired math teacher in a small town along Maine's coast.  In many of the stories she is barely present, yet is always an influence on the characters.  Like her or loathe her, the reader cannot be indifferent to Olive, or totally unsympathetic.  One of the most intense and memorable stories is ""A Different Road"", about a traumatic experience in which Olive falls briefly in love with a most unlikely character.  Olive's dysfunctional relationships with just about everyone, especially her husband and son, are often ineffably sad, but with occasional hints of redemption.  Each story is completely absorbing."

"Not That Kind of Girl: A Young Woman Tells You What She's ""Learned""",081299499X,"Lena Dunham, Joana Avillez",Barnes and Noble,3.1,Anonymous,"If you are looking for a book delving into the psychology of Generation Z, there are other books out there. But, if you like the show and are looking for a light-hearted look into twenty-something awkwardness, you will love this book. Lena Dunham does not disappoint with her first book. What reads like a series of personal essays, the book touches on navigating through twenty-something life, sprinkled with advice and of course plenty of humor. In many ways, the book feels in tone like Girls is to watch: self-deprecating humor, neuroses, therapy-laden dependence, bad choices, and awkward situations. Best of all, Dunham sprinkles it with enough humor and affability to let the reader look back at their own life and laugh a bit too. Overall, this book is highly recommended and definitely a must read even if you have to convince your sister to buy it and borrow it when she is done."

Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap... and Others Don't,0066620996,James C. Collins,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Shyamashree-Rudra,"Good to Great is Jim Collins's follow-up to Built to Last, the 1994 management classic, which he co-wrote with Jerry Porras. Infact, Collins calls Good To Great a ""prequel"" to his hugely successful Built To Last. I call it one of the most important Business Leadership books I have read. While Built To Last was a great book, however, it left out critical information, because those companies were already great. What about those of us struggling to move our companies from Good To Great as opposed to those trying to hold on to greatness? The missing piece is clearly identified in Collins' Good To Great. Collins spent five years of research assisted by 20 business school students, who analyzed 1,435 public companies for this book. Their findings - just 11 companies from were able to sustainable their good to great efforts. 
Having identified the companies that made the leap from Good To Great, Collins and his team set out to examine the transition point. What characteristics did the Good To Great companies have that their industry counterparts did not? What didn't the Good To Great companies have? Collins maps out three stages, each with two key concepts. These six concepts are the heart of Good To Great and he devotes a chapter to explaining each of them.
.Level 5 Leadership
.First Who... Then What
.Confront the Brutal Facts
.The Hedgehog Concept
.A Culture of Discipline
.Technology Accelerators
Many experts have problems with the way Collins and his team performed their ""research."" Some argue that Collins's measure for greatness is flawed or that his work fails to be classified as true research because it does not follow any scientific method. Or that the key measure used by Collins (""Ratio of Cumulative Stock Returns to General Market"") looks at the company only through the eyes of one stakeholder - the owners. These arguments may be a bit unfair because some of the variables in business do not lend themselves well to true research; greatness is a subjective quality; and the amount of immeasurable historical variables for this particular project is so immense. If research of this nature was an easy task, we should have written tried and tested formulas for perfect businesses, leaders, schools, cities, et al during our 3,000 plus years of civilization. 
Unlike many business books that are based on hype and after-market consulting services, Good to Great is mainly based on good old fashion business principles. Sure, Collins renames some of them with gimmicky names like Hedgehog Concept and The Flywheel. But for the most part, Collins's book has some sound principles in it that the reader shouldn't necessarily take as a game plan, but rather a starting point for conversation, reflection and inspiration both for themselves and their team. 
How does his research reflect in the current economic slowdown? If I were to apply Collins' theory in today's recessionary environment, I would show one priority above all others: to acquire as many of the best people as possible. I'd put off everything else to fill my bus. Because things are going to come back. The flywheel is going to start to turn. And the single biggest constraint on the success of any organization will be the ability to get and to hang on to enough of the right people.
To sum up, Good to Great can be a very useful tool when its principles are adapted to the user's unique situation and variables."
Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap... and Others Don't,0066620996,James C. Collins,Barnes and Noble,4.2,MAXIMUS15,"After reading this book I was not very impressed. Jim Collins started with a template and tried to find companies that would fit into his template. His leadership idea is nothing new and he could have taken all the leaders in the world and found stories that fit into his mold. His revelations are obnoxious and he spends about half the book talking about the good to great concept instead of using deep analysis to uncover some hidden truths.

One of the greatest flaws of this book is how he took a good look at certain companies through interviews but he failed to study any of the accounting changes that effected some of the businesses he discusses. One of the most notable is Walgreen's and circuit city who were able to structure their leases in such a way that they did not have to disclose them on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities. Walgreens and Circuit City grew because their bankers didn't get the full picture of how much debt the company was able to take on under the table and not disclose. Now that these companies are forced to disclose that information they appear less solvent and their stock price has adjusted to reality. Additionally Circuit City tanked when the new accounting practices and bad economy showed how insolvent they really were.

Other things Jim Collins failed to mention involved the establishment of right to work states that ended union control on companies and allowed NUCOR to establish one of the most efficient manufactures in the world.

Most of the companies Jim talks about have fallen apart in heaps and are bad to average. He should have written a book about how little research he had to do to write a book that would get praise from the entire academic sector but be a complete bad to worse book at best.

Don't buy the book! Save your money and take some accounting classes and you can then uncover what takes a company from good to great!"
Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap... and Others Don't,0066620996,James C. Collins,Barnes and Noble,4.2,KROG,"I thought this book was well written and a pleasure to read. While reading I could not help but wonder where are these companies now? Many are no longer in business and several have been able to continue with their success. Circuit City, Fannie Mae, and Gillette are three that are no longer &ldquo;great&rdquo;.  Two that seem to still be thriving are Walgreens and Wells Fargo.  Although three out of the eleven companies studied are no longer in business I do not think this discredits Collins&rsquo; work. His overall message that, &ldquo;Greatness is not a function of circumstance. Greatness, it turns out, is largely a matter of conscious choice&rdquo; can still be applied to anyone who wants to enhance their company. 

The book is instructive and accessible and I think this is a great book to add to the curriculum for all business students.  By using metaphors Collins makes his ideas easy to understand and follow which will become critical as future business executives try to emulate.  He gives concrete examples of company&rsquo;s successes and failures and then applies tangible models that are easy to imitate.  I also believe that this book goes beyond just a business book. This book can be used for several different professions and for the overall betterment of one&rsquo;s life.  We all look to become an effective leader, find something that we are truly good at, and surround ourselves with people who help achieve our goals. Sometime in life it better to think like Collins and not always try to come up with the answers, but better to ask the right questions."
"Fire (Graceling Realm, #2)",0803734611,Kristin Cashore,Barnes and Noble,4.4,alissa47,"I loved Graceling, so I was more than eager to jump into Fire-and believe me, it did not disppoint. It was every bit as good as Graceling. Within the first five minutes of reading I had an oh #@%& moment,and was hooked until the end. I love the way Kristin Cashore developes her characters-and to think, this is only her second book. I am already in great anticipation for the realse of Bitterblue. If you are a fan of Graceling, this book will not disppoint and no review will be able to do it justice."
"Fire (Graceling Realm, #2)",0803734611,Kristin Cashore,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Angieville,"GRACELING was one of my very favorite reads of 2008 and the year's best YA I would venture to say. And before you get all up in arms, let me assure you I enjoyed THE HUNGER GAMES as much as the next person. But GRACELING was just the one, you know? And I have this feeling that Kristin Cashore is something special. I was positively thrumming with anticipation when I heard she had a second book to follow. FIRE is, in point of fact, a prequel to GRACELING and takes place 30 years or so prior to Katsa and Poe's story. It is also set in an entirely different land, though definitely in the same world, and (as I am sure you have already heard) a certain terrifyingly familiar character from GRACELING makes an appearance in FIRE. Otherwise, it is its own story and it stands completely on its own feet.

Fire is a monster. A human monster. And the last of her kind. In her homeland, the Dells, there are all manner of monsters from lizards and mosquitoes to leopards and raptors. But they all have one thing in common--their incomparable beauty. These creatures come in a gorgeous riot of color and texture and are so beautiful they literally impede rational thought in the humans they come into contact with. With the ability to control the minds of those around them, they inspire an uncomfortable (at times deadly) mixture of fear, hatred, and absolute longing in the people of the Dells. And no one is more hated or sought after than Fire. Her father was King Nax's most trusted advisor and closest friend. He was also the one responsible for the king's untimely death and for the current chaotic state of the realm. When Fire's service is requested on behalf of the young King Nash and his brother and war commander Brigan, Fire is thrust out of her quiet life and into a mounting war. Forced to reconcile her questionable abilites with her own demanding conscience, she is immediately caught between right and wrong, a dark past and uncertain present, and a pair of brothers determined to win at all costs.

This book made short work of me. There was just so much hope inside me wrapped around how good it would be and when it turned out to be approximately ten times better than all that wrapped up hope....well....I was a goner. I looked forward all day long to the moment I could crawl back in bed and read more about the Dells and Fire and Brigan and Archer. And the list goes on. These characters are breathtakingly real and the way the gorgeous, understated writing tugs and pulls and builds a complex and lovely world around them makes the whole package irresistable. Best of all, Fire herself struck a chord deep within me and I held my breath as I watched her move through her world, worried she wouldn't meet with enough care, hoping someone in the messy throng of plotting, planning, warring kings and soldiers would recognize her for what she was. Like Katsa before her, she is so very strong, an outcast her entire life, and yet she never turns her back on those who need her. Even when they have no idea how desperately they do. Even when she herself is afraid. FIRE is, wait for it, even better than its predecessor. It's subtle and thoughtful and throbbing with genuine emotion--three qualities I often find lacking in my reading. It is, without a doubt, the most difficult of combinations to achieve, but when the right note is struck....magic."
"Fire (Graceling Realm, #2)",0803734611,Kristin Cashore,Barnes and Noble,4.4,acornucopiaoflove,"Ever since I read that Kristin Cashore was writing two companion novels to Graceling, I couldn't wait to read them. Graceling was a great novel (that I couldn't put down), so I set my hopes very high for Fire.

Characters:
This story focuses on the character, Fire, a half-human, half-monster. She's able to control the minds of people around her, but she's very cautious about using this power unless it's absolutely necessary. Similar to Katsa, Fire is an extremely strong female character, but she's conflicted about her gifts. She's extremely beautiful, due to her half-monster lineage. This may sound like a blessing, but she is forced to hide her dazzling hair under a scarf, because it attracts people to her. To Fire, her monster powers are more of a curse than a gift. It's also because of these powers that she's constantly reminded of her father. He was fiercely protective of her, but cruel to everyone else he encountered.

Plot:
I really enjoyed Fire's story. It seemed like the book delved a lot deeper into who she was. Particularly, what it meant to be part-monster, but feel as humans do. I enjoyed reading Fire's memories of her father, Cansrel. He was a full monster, and had no qualms with manipulating the minds of people around him to do his bidding. Fire's memories seemed to emphasize that, while she hadn't always made the best choices, she had a conscience. She never manipulated the minds of people when it wasn't completely necessary. The romance was very subtle, and built up very nicely over the course of the story. It didn't feel rushed, or forced, and really affirmed the humanity in Fire.

We also got to see the origins of a character from Graceling. I won't give away the name, even though he's introduced in the very early pages of the book. I'll just say this, I hated the character in this book too!

Final Say:
Is it wrong that I want a sequel about Fire? I absolutely loved this book, and can't wait for Bitterblue, Cashore's next book."
White Fang,0439236193,Jack London,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Wiicho-,"In the amassing story White Fang By Jack London the author teaches you to keep moving on.  This is because through out the story white fang (the main character) faces many problems such as losing his mother, getting into illegal dog fights, and many more, but despite that he kept moving on.

    The story begins with two men mushing (dog sledding) up in the mountains of Alaska.  Soon their dogs start to disappear one by one, this is because of a she-wolf and her pack of wolfs killing them.  One night Henry (one of the men) spots the wolfs trying to eat one their dogs.  Immediately got his gun out, sadly it only had 3 bullets.  As quick as possible Henry charged towards the wolf's.  Henry fired his gun but sadly missed.  Before Henry could reload his gun one of the wolfs pounced on him and killed him leaving Bill (the other man) all alone.  Luckily Bill scared off the wolfs by using fire.  Afterwards the wolfs regrouped.  The she-wolf then found a mate and had puppies, unfortunately only one of the pups survived.  The she-wolf and white fang(the pup) then returned to a native American village where the she-wolf's master lived.  Soon the master sold the she-wolf to another man leaving White fang all alone with Gray beaver(The master).

    Time went on and white fang grew more vicious each day.  Grey beaver then decided to move to another city.  Once there Gary beaver encountered beauty smith(a monster of a man) and was forced to give white fang to him.  Beauty Smith then started to make white fang more vicious.  Afterward he put white fang in illegal dog fights.  White fang kept wining and wining, until one day that he met his match a bulldog.  White fang fought but got injured and almost died luckily a young man named Scott save his life.  Scott then tamed white fang and brought him to California whit him where he lived a happy life.

     This book has been one of the best ones I've read.  This is because this book has action, drama, and suspense all packed into one book. I also recommend The Call of the wild By Jack London.  I recommend this book to anyone who likes action and suspense."

There is news of the Beams and the Breakers, and even the Low Men make an appearance. There is the small matter of Susannah¿s demon pregnancy. And there is a spaghetti Western-style plot in which Roland and the others have to save a town from marauding wolves who steal one-half of all the town¿s twins (and the kids are mostly twins), only to return them retarded and doomed ¿ ¿roont,¿ as the townsfolk of the Calla say.The cross-references abound, and King even manages to gleefully introduce elements from Marvel comics, Star Wars and the Harry Potter series. But the climactic reference in thrillingly audacious, even for King. I won¿t give it away; suffice it to say, you won¿t be able to wait to start reading Part 6."
His Dark Materials (His Dark Materials #1-3),0440238609,Philip Pullman,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"I'm 14 and read the whole series in, I think, 5th or 6th grade.  I went to a Catholic school for 6 years going to a school wide mass every Wednsday. I think I could be called a Catholic, don't you?  While reading them I didn't hear anything negative about the books or even the author from anyone including my teachers.  Now however, I was looking at the books in a used book store and someone came up to me and said that anyone who read the books is going to hell.  I really do laugh at anybody with that mentality because, if you read it as a work of fiction, all of a sudden it is an amazing story.  I also went to the movie.  Because the director was trying to be 'politically correct' the movie suffered horribly (don't get me wrong, it was good).  Anyone who says that this series is brainwashing children obviously does not have enough confidence in thier self to resist temptation and what is life but the temptation to do wrong?  All in all, wonderfull series, but I wish people could learn how to read and decide for themselves."
His Dark Materials (His Dark Materials #1-3),0440238609,Philip Pullman,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"Fist of all let me say that these books were incredible. I am a PhD level scientist and I thought that it was incredible that the author actually introduced some high level scientific ideas into this book. My real concern here lies in how so many so-called 'christians' are preaching intolerance and are approaching the level of advocating censorship. Atheism is a religion (if you don't understand then maybe you should read something other than your bible some time), saying that it isn't, is like saying that 0 is not a number. Now, that being said, this book is a fantasy tale that happens to have a spiritual side that supports and proclaims the religious beliefs of the author. The issue here is that atheism is not as accepted in our society as Christianity, or Islam, or the various other religions out there. Would everyone really be in such an uproar if this book were about another religion. Considering I was forced to read the lion, the which and the wardrobe in school and it didn't turn me in to some deluded Christ follower, I have no sympathy for your concerns. 'christians', try some of these things:  1) try to be a little open minded and experience things that don't quite fit in your perfect little delusion.  2) try leading people to your religion by example and preaching love and compassion instead of trying to force people to your god by banning books, ignoring proven science, and attmepting to make sins illegal through political means.   3) have a little faith in your children. they know the difference in a fairy tale and a religious text and if they don't maybe you should try talking to them a little more instead of just regulating their input."
His Dark Materials (His Dark Materials #1-3),0440238609,Philip Pullman,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"I just want to discuss what makes a great fantasy novel. There are plenty of fantasy books, and most of them are really good.  But it is harder to come by one that is special, one that is great. It is hard to come by a 'tale that really mattered'..............  In my opinion, HARRY POTTER, THE MISTS OF AVALON, HIS DARK MATERIALS, & THE LORD OF THE RINGS are the greatest fantasy novels ever written.  Why do I think this?  I think this because these stories emanate a feeling of POWER so great that I KNOW they really happened, somewhere, sometime.  It is a VERY difficult feeling to describe.  I get it too when I am watching STAR WARS EPISODE III (the new one), or the LOTR movies.  In movies, I know music helps create this feeling, this POWERFUL emotion  but in books, it is only the words on the page and the imagination of the reader.................Do you ever get this feeling?  The feeling which makes you want to cry, yell and kill something all at once?  The great welling of sadness and happiness that fills your heart when you read something especially POWERFUL?  Do you get this feeling when you're reading about Lyra and Pan being ripped from each other on the docks of the Land of the Dead, or when Lyra and Will must make the terrible decision about which door to leave open?  Or do you get it when Snape utters the fatal words, or when Harry shares his destiny of finding and destroying the horcruxes with Ron and Hermione in the last pages of 'The White Tomb'?  Do you get this feeling when King Arthur kills Mordred (his own son!) or when Morgaine enters the Isle of the Priests, and you know in your heart that Avalon will be lost to the mists forever?  Do you get this wonderful/horrible emotion when Aragorn and Theoden charge out into the morning at Helms Deep shouting, 'Forth Eorlingas!', or when Frodo says, 'I am glad you are here with me.  Here at the end of all things, Sam.'.................  I hope all of you, fellow fantasy lovers, have felt this POWERFUL feeling once while you were reading.  The emotion that thrusts deep into your heart and soul and tells you that these places, these people, are or were once REAL.  You can see them...you are almost there with them.  Even if you are the lowliest peasant of Gondor, or the simplest child lost in the Land of the Dead, you know that the POWER of these stories has led you there, and that you ARE there, even as you turn the page in your book.................And when you have finished your book, you wish with all your heart that you could return to that place, whether it be Hogwarts, Camelot, or Middle-Earth, because in those places there is real HONOR & GLORY & POWER. That is where good battles evil, and the story has made you yearn to be a part of that battle.  I hope that all of you have experienced this feeling, which wrenches your heartstrings and broadens your imagination.  I hope that you who KNOW IN YOUR HEART that you are an angel or daemon of Lyra's world, or a great crusader, or a priestess of Avalon, or an Auror or a Death Eater, or a Warrior of the West-of Gondor or Rohan, or a simple hobbit from the Shire...I hope that you have felt this emotion, because it proves that you have read GREAT, POWERFUL, MEANINGFUL books, and that surely, you belong in a fantasy world...........  The greatest praise I can give to JRR Tolkien, Marion Zimmer Bradley, Philip Pullman & JK Rowling is that while reading their books, I felt this POWER, this great & terrible emotion.................  I hope all of you have felt this POWER, and have cried or screamed with REAL emotion...and if you haven't felt this, than I advise you to read these books, and maybe you will be blessed with this incredible feeling.  And if you don't read (which is a crime), then you should at least watch LOTR, and maybe when Aragorn shouts 'I bid you fight! Men of the West!' you will feel it too..............And now I have shared my views on what makes a 'tale that really mattered'.  I thank you all for reading this."
"The Edge of Never (The Edge of Never, #1)",1480095532,J.A. Redmerski,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Ari_K,"This is, hands down, one of the best books I've read this year! Not just because of how original, emotional and brilliant the story is, and not because I'm a huge sucker for road-trip/traveling stories, but it's written in exactly the way I like it and I am just blown away by it.
Actually, I'm writing this on zero sleep because I got the &quot;one more chapter&quot; disease reading it - I really just wanted to read the first chapter while getting ready to go to bed to see if I'd like it...and see how that turned out!

Andrew is the perfect hero! I have never said this before, and probably never will again, but yeah, he really was perfect. He is a genuinely nice guy with just the right amount of cockiness, but there are just so many more layers than that to his character. You seriously can't help but fall in love with him and everything about him!

I loved Cam, too. She is strong but fragile at the same time, and honestly, I admired her bravery to just get away from everything and leave. I love it that she breaks all her rules and doesn't fight herself breaking them.

And I loved their banter and camaraderie, the way they were teasing each other (the pool playing scene? brilliant.) the chemistry between Cam and Andrew was just...perfect. Somehow their relationship progressed in very realistic way and I really really liked that.

So many feelings about this.
You don't see the twist coming at all, at least not one like that. I mean, I guessed there was something going on, but it kind of all comes crashing down when you least expect it with a BAM! and it's a lot to take in.
The last two chapters made me gasp and cry in turns.

I mean, just wow. The pacing of this is perfect, the switching of POV was unexpected but welcomed - I was concerned about this in the beginning, but really, the author handles it perfectly, she gives these two characters two completely different voices! Oh and yeah, some of the best sex scenes I've read in a while.
I haven't read anything by J.A. Redmerski before but I will definitely try to, now that I've seen what she can do!"
"The Edge of Never (The Edge of Never, #1)",1480095532,J.A. Redmerski,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"I started and finished this book today because I could not put it down!! Hands down one of the best books I have read in a while. Lots of different emotions, laughter, anger and oh my goodness... sadness. I would highly reccomend!!"
"The Edge of Never (The Edge of Never, #1)",1480095532,J.A. Redmerski,Barnes and Noble,4.6,DaisyLovesBooks,"I laughed, I cried, I perfected my O face. And I was completely jealous that Andrew Parrish wasn't mine. 

First off, let me begin with how gorgeous that cover is. The girl's a beauty and it immediately draws you in and makes you envious. However, that envy was short-lived as I journeyed through The Edge of Never. At first, I felt the beginning read a little slow. I didn't realize until later that the problem wasn't pace, it was her life. Cam was absolutely miserable, and just following along with her made me realize how unhappy she was, just how mundane everything around her was as she dealt with the aftermath of the past two years. Her first boyfriend, who she lost her virginity to, died in a car accident, her next boyfriend cheated on her, her alcoholic brother was in jail 'cause he killed someone driving drunk one night, and her father cheated on her mother and they got divorced, so now she was tramping around dating everything in sight. It wasn't until she got fed up with everything and boarded the bus to nowhere and met Andrew Parrish, that Cam seemed to come to life and her story began to excite me. And then I appreciated the way the beginning read, 'cause if it hadn't, I never would've realized what an impact Andrew had on Cam's spirit.

Andrew Parrish: Sexy. Protective and Possessive (in a Good Way). Sexually Confidant. Secretly Passionate. And there were soooooooooo many times I wanted to give Cam the boot and take her place. The best part of all was that Cam didn't even know why he was trying to keep her attention in the beginning, and the more time they spent together, the more he fell for her. They both had their reasons to be stubborn about taking their newfound relationship further, and the angst was literally ripping my heart to shreds. Both Cam and Andrew had fallen on hard times, and both deserved something positive to happen in their lives, so you can't help but root for them as one problem after another tests their strength. By the end, I think I shed enough tears to fill Lake Pontchartrain.

J.A. Redmerski has won my heart all over again. The Edge of Never is by far the best of her work. Okay...I may be a little bias 'cause I love books heavy on angst, where the couple doesn't just throw themselves into bed, but eventually gets there and gives me some of the hottest scenes that perfect my O face and activates the launch sequence for book boyfriend jealousy. Check it out, you're gonna love it. And peeps, this novel is for the 17+ crowd for language and very hot, yummy, descriptive sexual situations."
Reconstructing Amelia,006222543X,Kimberly McCreight,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,Definitely a MUST to read! Leaves you on the edge of your seat and keeps you hooked all the way through. An ending you never saw coming and so many twists &amp; turns. Outstanding!
Reconstructing Amelia,006222543X,Kimberly McCreight,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"Every now and then you read a book that surprises you for just how unique it is. A story that sets itself apart from any other. This book was that for me. Some reviewers were disappointed with the end. I wasn't. I honestly don't think the end matters. This book is about relationships, about lost opportunities and forgiveness. It is about finding out who we are by learning about who the people we loved really were and still finding a way to live with our mistakes and the 'what if's'. A fantastic story, terrific writing, and a book and characters that keep you thinking. You cannot ask for more."
Reconstructing Amelia,006222543X,Kimberly McCreight,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"The writing was absolutely horrid.  I couldn't stomach the way the writer was trying SO HARD to sound like she knows how teens/young adults talk -- she missed the mark by A LOT.   This is the last sentence I read and gave up (this is supposed to be a 24 year old IT guy who works at one of the top law firms in New York&hellip;but is also a stoner...):  &quot;...Because you don't want to like [sic] get into the deets of your kid's Facebook page. I mean, I'm twenty-four, and I'm a pretty scrubbed-up guy and whatevs, but my 'rents would stroke out if they saw my whole page. You've gotta filter it for ma and pa. I mean, who wants to see their kid doing body shots, like, ever?&quot;
 There are grammatical and spelling errors riddled throughout the book, which drove me bananas. Sentence structure was that of somebody who has never written before. The plot could have been interesting, but the writing was just too much to get past.  Also, this is definitely not a book that should be marketed towards adults.  Her &quot;trying-to-be-hip-and-with-it&quot; lingo will turn off the younger crowd as well...Definitely not recommended."
One Plus One,0525426582,Jojo Moyes,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,Loved it.  Two people with their own problems are suddenly together.  It has you cheering for the underdog and wjshing that karma does get the good and the bad what they deserve
One Plus One,0525426582,Jojo Moyes,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"One plus One was an okay read.  Typical love story.. Girl meets boy, girl doesn't like boy, girl falls in love with boy, boy leaves girl, boy comes back...ta-da...Happy Ending. Still, even though I knew the happy ending was coming, the over all story held my interest. I finished it, but nothing that shook me up."
One Plus One,0525426582,Jojo Moyes,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"A very charming book.  Well written and I loved the characters.  The characters were very true to life, a mother struggling to do the right thing for her children, the children a little off center and a goofy dog.  And not to forget the male character and his connection to the family.  The book was very different from Me Before You.  It was a delightful and funny book. Ms Moyes other book, The Girl I Left Behind was also very good and very different from this book.  She is an excellent writer and brings so much to her books.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book and her other books."
The Hours,0312305060,Michael Cunningham,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"Michael Cunningham's The Hours is a timeless piece of literary achievement that is deserving of its Pulitzer Prize. He remarkably and cleverly weaves the stories of three different women of three different time periods into one flowing story. There is Virginia Woolf in 1923, and her story is followed as she writes her greatest literary achievement, Mrs. Dalloway. Then, there is Laura Brown, a wife and mother from 1949, who struggles with the confinement of her life and seeks to escape it through reading Mrs. Dalloway. Then finally, there is Clarissa Vaughn, a curious reincarnation of Clarissa Dalloway, who is alive at the end of the twentieth century, and whose story follows the planning of a party for a friend. Each finds herself in an undesired position -one of dissatisfaction. These three stories are soon woven together, depicting each individual's triumphs and sorrows and eventually, the connection all three share, despite the passage of time. 
The book really gave me something to chew on. For one, Cunningham's depiction of the theme of confinement was certainly interesting. Though each woman is under a very different situation, each feels that they are somehow constrained. What is more interesting is how each woman handles her situation. Another thing that amazed me was Cunningham's ability to highlight the most everyday things, and give them the most expressive descriptions to make them come alive. He is able to portray that life does not just go on, but every waking moment of life is something special. Interestingly enough, he also contrasts that theme with the idea that life is just a fleeting picture. 
I personally found the book enjoyable. The imagery Michael creates is just stunning, and really brings out the essence of everyday life. At the same time, he is able to manipulate the imagery, syntax, and diction to create a different picture depending on the character. The plot is certainly unique and is very craftily put together. I enjoyed my time reading the book for its literary brilliance. At the same time, I feel that the book was a little over-done at times. While the descriptions certainly add to the life of the book, they do become slightly overwhelming or confusing at times. Also, there are a lot of names to keep track of, making certain parts feel like they're too much to swallow at once. I would recommend this book to those who are looking for a good read and a good piece of literature. After I finished reading, not only was I left wowed, but I was also left with a lot to think about. However, I wouldn't recommend this to someone looking for a climactic plot, or a thriller as this is one of those pieces that is simply done to show the power of the pen. Also, it is better suited toward juniors in high school and beyond, as it features some material that requires some maturity to appreciate. 
And so, through his great style of writing, Cunningham is able to entice the reader into getting lost in The Hours, much as Laura Brown fell into Mrs. Dalloway."
The Hours,0312305060,Michael Cunningham,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"If you've seen the movie and not yet read the book, I would highly recommend Mr. Cunningham's work. The successful transfer of his novel to motion picture says a great deal about David Hare, the man who wrote the screenplay,and did a beautiful job, I must say. The way the movie flows from one era to another is done so masterfully by all who worked to create the motion picture version of this work. Both the novel and screenplay are a 'NOT TO BE MISSED, MUST READ AND SEE'. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND BOTH!"
The Hours,0312305060,Michael Cunningham,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"THE HOURS is a book both beautiful and agonizing, portraying human emotion clearly, like a bell rung through a forest: you hear it, you want to run to it, but it is too far away. Lovely."
"Wallbanger (Cocktail, #1)",1623420024,Alice Clayton,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"There&rsquo;s almost nothing in this world that I love more than laughing out loud while reading a book. I did that over and over while reading Wallbanger. Alice knows just how to intermingle hilarious situations with crazy monkey sex without making me feel uncomfortable for laughing at a sexy book.

Wallbanger is a Smut Book Club MUST MUST read for fans of a well-written story, well-crafted characters who make you warm in your belly and laugh out loud."
"Wallbanger (Cocktail, #1)",1623420024,Alice Clayton,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"So funny and engaging!
I almost did not buy this book because of its title. But am I glad I did! I don't usually laugh reading books, but this one cracked me up from beginning to end. The dialogs are so fresh and funny that you feel as if you are part of them, like the way you would talk to your girlfriends or the friend next door. The jokes don't get old or tiring. And the continuous banter between the characters is critical to the storyline and the development of this beautiful love story that starts in the most unconventional way: the woman meeting the man that wakes her up every night with his steamy sexual encounters (he is the 'wallbanger'). This book does not disappoint!"
"Wallbanger (Cocktail, #1)",1623420024,Alice Clayton,Barnes and Noble,4.5,calwen,"Wallbanger is quite funny and enjoyable story. Main theme of the story is heroine's unsuccessful sex life and her frustration with the fact that she cannot change it while her neighbour is enjoying his harem girls reguraly and loudly... Besides the sexual frustration of main heroine, the level of angst is quite low, so it was light read for me. From time to time I just need to switch off and not think during the book, and Wallbanger gave me exactly that. Caroline had great sense of humour and it kept me intrigued through out the whole story. 

If you are in mood for some funny and easy reading, go for this one."
Holidays on Ice,0316191299,David Sedaris,Barnes and Noble,3.7,FeliciaPM,"David Sedaris once again brilliantly entertains us with his fabulously witty insights and edgy musings on a different view of the holidays in this collection of short stories and embellished essays.  A great escape for any memeber of the family during the trying times of the holidays, or for any person who can relate to the complicated nature families seem to exist in when they get together."
Holidays on Ice,0316191299,David Sedaris,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,Holidays on ice is absolutely one of the funniest books I've ever had the sheer pleasure of reading. The 'Macy's Elf' essay is side-splittingly funny.
Holidays on Ice,0316191299,David Sedaris,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,Holidays on Ice - It's hard to write a review through the tears of laughter. A very funny book. Remember the school Christmas plays? Suppose a theater critic was there and wrote a review. It happens in Holidays on Ice. Santaland Diaries is a classic that everyone who ever waited in line to sit on Santa's lap will appreciate. And there's the Christmas letter from hell. Don't wait until December to read this book. Read it now!
Desperation,0451188462,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"Everything seems normal for the various people travelling through Nevada on the U.S. 50, that is, until a cop with strange eyes pulls each of them over for no apparent reason. Mysteriously, each of the novelÃ¢â¿¬â¿¢s characters are charged and arrested for crimes that they are almost certain they did not commit. One individual finds drugs in the back of his car and has no clue where they came from  another is ushered into the back of the police car after all four of his tires were punctured by an inconveniently placed piece of police equipment. All of these individuals are taken to a small town in Desperation, Nevada, an area with a name that sets the mood for the novel. The plot takes an ugly twist almost immediately when the now erratic and seemingly insane cop kills off one individual and throws the rest into holding cells. From there, the main characters of the novel, which are surprisingly well developed, despite the large amount of them, try to break out of the copÃ¢â¿¬â¿¢s prison (complete with a guard wolf), and escape from the twisted and plagued town which prays upon the fears and weaknesses of each individual, undermining their every move in an attempt to supply hosts for a greater, primal entity. While it may seem that KingÃ¢â¿¬â¿¢s novel is a bit out there and much too unbelievable to contain anything beside a fun read, this is not so. In fact, one of DesperationÃ¢â¿¬â¿¢s most appealing factors is its in-depth analysis of the human psyche, which, as a real world application, presents a satisfying contrast to the novelÃ¢â¿¬â¿¢s fantastical (Although I stress that it is darker and more twisted than the typical fantasy tales) plot. Combine such an intriguing, thought provoking story with Stephen KingÃ¢â¿¬â¿¢s writing, which describes every horrible moment of the novel in such a way that the reader can picture the scene perfectly. Desperation is the only book that I have ever read which was able, through such descriptive writing and a captivating, yet revolting (in a good way), tale, to make me paranoid for a while after putting it down at night. Thus, I give Desperation a full five star rating and label it as one of my favorite books."
Desperation,0451188462,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.3,xMissMelaniex,"I started reading Stephen King as a teenager. Back then he could throw anything at me and I ate it up. As an adult, he actually goes places I'm not sure I like him going and I'm totally horrified! He's still a masterful writer and if you love having the tarnation scared out of you, no one will do it better."
Desperation,0451188462,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"I think this book is classic Stephen King, and it represents the best of Stephen King.  I loved this book for the same reasons I love The Green Mile and The Stand.  The novel contains a well proportioned mix of fear, humanity, and spirituality.  What made Desperation different from The Stand and The Green Mile was that the scare factor was much larger in this novel.  There was a lot more violence, suspense, and thrill to it.  However, the undertones of the story, i.e. the spirituality of it, was what really made it impossible for me to put down.  I read it in less than a week, which is unprecedented for a slow reader like me.      Don't listen to the nay-sayers.  This book is VERY worth reading and I suggest you give it a try if you are feeling on the fence about it."

"The Kill Order (Maze Runner, #0.5)",0385742886,James Dashner,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"James Dashner has done it again! In this prequel to The Maze Runner, friendship, love, and humanity are put to the test.

Scales (1 to 10)

Characters - 6
The characters in this book aren't as likeable as those in The Maze Runner. The just don't have the same pizazz as Thomas and his friends in the maze.

Writing - 7
Dashner definity improved his writing tecniques since The Maze Runner trilogy. However, sometimes I felt as though the author was only writing certain selections for the sole purpose of appealing to young people through unecassary violence and romance.

Violence - 9
The book is packed full of action seens. Although it's not as violent as The Maze Runner or even The Hunger Games. The gore is kept to a minimum although parents and teahers should be wary.

Sexuality/Sensuality - 4
The main character, Mark, has a girlfriend. The do hug and kiss on some occasions. Towards the begining of the book, his girlfriend makes a joke about the two of them having sex and later in the book, they spend the night togeather but the book goes into no further details.

Drugs/Alchol - 2
There are a few minor alchol references in the book, but nothing extreme.

Swearing - 4 
Mild inapropriate language is used. Words such as ""damn,"" ""hell,"" and ""bastard"".

Sexism/Prejuicism/Racism - 3
There are practically no strong female characters in the book.

Recomended minimum age of reader: 12"

"The Kill Order (Maze Runner, #0.5)",0385742886,James Dashner,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Cupcakegirly,"I was really looking forward to this prequel to the Maze Runner trilogy because I thoroughly enjoyed those books. (Team Minho FTW) However, this wasn't what I was expecting. There's a prologue and epilogue that focus on the characters of the Glade but other than that, this is a completely different story with new characters. It's still interesting and action packed with characters as intense as the ones we've come to know but for fans looking for more information on Thomas, Teresa, or Brenda, they might be disappointed. I was hoping for more background on the Gladers themselves. For those readers who are just beginning the series, I would say to this is a good place to start."
Empire Falls,0375726403,Richard Russo,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,I read the reviews to get a feel for how others have liked or disliked a novel but I do not appreciate the major spoiler disclosed by the February 2010 writer.   Come on people!  Sheesh.
Empire Falls,0375726403,Richard Russo,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"When my mom recommended this book, I was a little skeptical- her taste and mine don't necessarily mesh. From around the third page, I could see why she enjoyed this book. Great subtle humor from the main character's perspective! You can envision living in Empire Falls, because it is not so different from many small towns in America. As a mom, I was interested in the relationship between Tick and her mother, as well as her and her father's relationship. Overall, a wonderful read for just about anyone. Even my sister wants to read it now after how I said what a good book it is, and she doesn't even like to read! This would be a great book for book club discussion as well."
Empire Falls,0375726403,Richard Russo,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"When I first started reading it, I wondered, 'what is this book going to be ABOUT?' By the time I was halfway through, I was so involved with the character's lives that the plot evolved without my realizing it. Engaging, insightful, heartbreaking, a wonderful read, fully accessible to all readers.  Empire Falls, a small town economically ruled for many years by the Whiting family in Maine, begins to lose over the years the 'ROYAL' family and their influence. The true power lies not with this wealthy family, but with the force of HUMAN WILL POWER 'whether a WHITING or a NON-WHITING'. The constant question that arose: what WILL these characters do now with his/her given challenge?"
"The Fires of Heaven (Wheel of Time, #5)",1857232097,Robert Jordan,Barnes and Noble,4.6,DimLee,"I am a huge Robert Jordan fan but this book was not very good for one reason alone, the focus on the female characters relationships. If you buy this book be ready for a heavy handed dose of female melodrama. This book definitely has it bright spots but they are almost always eclipsed by the female characters constant back and forth banter. If you buy this book you would be better served skip large portions of the book when ever Egwene or any other of the female characters goes on a rant."
"The Fires of Heaven (Wheel of Time, #5)",1857232097,Robert Jordan,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Guest,"Great story telling, rich characters,.. but I'm convinced that Jordan has some HUGE issues: do all of his female characters have to be harping witches?   Are we to believe that the male characters are effecting changes in the world that will rock it to its very foundation, yet they can't tell these women to get off their backs?  The rare (and I mean RARE) women in these books that are straight-shooters always seem to get the shaft."
"The Fires of Heaven (Wheel of Time, #5)",1857232097,Robert Jordan,Barnes and Noble,4.6,FoxxxNightshade,"Robert Jordan was always a skillful artist with a pen, and he proves it yet again with this fifth installment to The Wheel of Time series. As things are heating up in the White Tower with the christening of a new Amyrlin Seat, and the hunt for Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn, time is of the essence. And not just in Tar Valon, but the other side of the Spine of the World, as a rogue group of Aiel are rampaging toward the Dragonwall under the leadership of one claiming to be He Who Comes With The Dawn himself. Rand, Moraine, Lan, Egwene and the other Aiel must rush to stop them if they are to save those behind the lengthy mountainside called the Spine of the World. This next book in the WOT series will grab you in the first few pages, and spark the fires for Robert Jordan's classic series of a simple shepherd and his friends who will shape the world more than they know, or break it in trying to stop the Father of Lies from being released from Shayol Ghul."
I'll Give You the Sun,0803734964,Jandy Nelson,Barnes and Noble,4.7,DahlELama,"That. Was freaking great. The descriptions of emotional pain were so visceral at times I was afraid to pick it back up, because I wasn't sure my heart could handle it. But the descriptions of pleasure are too, and of art, and of love, and of loss, and God, this was just beautiful. For me, the ending was unquestionably too neat, but I'm not gonna lie - I was secretly grateful for it. Definitely one of my favorites of the year."
I'll Give You the Sun,0803734964,Jandy Nelson,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Anonymous,"I just finished reading this and I'm already going through withdrawals. This book is relatively short, (under 300 pages) but you won't notice that while reading it. It's so full of life being lived and love being loved and lost being found. It feels like it's 3 years long. Which it is. It's been a long time since a novel has made me feel so much, so many, emotions. I ached, yearned, and rejoiced right alongside the characters. Thanks to Noah, I know just how to describe how reading this made me feel. Reading this book is like buckets and buckets of sunlight being poured over your head. This is NOT a YA book. It is a beautiful work of art, that will be appreciated, wholeheartedly, by anyone who loves art, and life, and love, and beautiful heartbreak, and the ties that bind us, in death, in life, in humanity. Thank you, Jandy, for creating this wonderful gift for us."
I'll Give You the Sun,0803734964,Jandy Nelson,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Anonymous,"I'll Give You The Sun is phenomenal. Absolutely breathtaking. The unique way the story was written was so well done, I did not put down the book once from when I had started it until I reached the end. I did not simply feel like I knew or understood the characters; I lived and breathed the characters. Everythng they felt, I felt along with them. I was happy and confused and angry and giddy and sad and excited and hurt and laughing and in love. Nothing felt forced and it was an exciting read thriughout. There were moments when I rushed so quickly to see what would happen next that i had to consciously slow myself down to fully appreciate the artistry annd detail in the novel. Nothing was predictable until it neared the end, and even then I was thrown a few surprises. The story was passionate, powerful, and inspirational. I would quickly recommend this to anyone (13 and up) because of the message. It encourages you to be yourself and to accept others for who they are. For me, as an avid reader, this is my favorite read since John Green. Please please read this book."
"Shopaholic & Baby (Shopaholic, #5)",0385338708,Sophie Kinsella,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"I found myself laughing out loud throughout Becky's adventures in pregnancy. From her obsession with shopping in all the chic baby boutiques, to ordering online and from the glossy upscale catalogues, to investing in &quot;antiques of the future&quot; for her baby's portfolio, Becky was in fine form. Now working (more or less) as a personal shopper at a laughingstock of a store, Becky finds ways to make it soar while enlisting the help of an old friend. Familiar characters like Suz, Mr. and Mrs. Bloomwood, Janice, Tom, Jess, and of course Luke, are all featured prominently as Becky goes in search of the A-list obstetrician, the choice of all the glam people, only to discover she is Luke's ex-girlfriend and still carries a torch for him. SHOPAHOLIC &amp; BABY is one misunderstanding after another, although it begins to look like maybe Becky isn't really misunderstanding anything at all. Is Luke really having an affair With Venetia? Will Becky allow this woman to deliver her baby? And what about all those baby strollers she bought? Will she be able to keep them all?  Quite simply, it is funny, believable and has a mother who readers should be able to relate to - or actually a mother-to-be. From the first days of pregnancy to other decisions, large and small, she is eccentric and lovable, in her own quirky way, fuming at her husband as he juggles business and HER needs, getting in debates with him about whether to learn the gender of the baby during an ultrasound, etc..great read. Trust me..."
"Shopaholic & Baby (Shopaholic, #5)",0385338708,Sophie Kinsella,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,While I have enjoyed previous Shopaholic books we could have done without this one.  Becky is so incredibly stupid you just can't believe the things she does.  She is a spoiled brat and so obsessed with herself.  The inaccuracies regarding pregnancy were appauling as well.  No one gets an epidural while they are in labor and who would believe her water had broken when it really hadn't.  Stick to shopping!
"Shopaholic & Baby (Shopaholic, #5)",0385338708,Sophie Kinsella,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"My main issue with this book is that the main character never seems to learn anything from her mishaps in previous books. Thus, it seems as if I'm reading the exact same book repeatedly.  There is no growth in her  she makes the same mistakes over and over and over.  I hope the next book in the series finds her just a little wiser and a little more mature."
"The Dark Tower (The Dark Tower, #7)",1416524525,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.3,CarleCJ,"To be honest, Steven King gave you all the option you had the good happy ending and you could have stopped there so I don't know why so many people complain about reading on when he clearly warns you will be dissapointed in the book and that it would be tragic. That said I actually really liked the ending and wanted to have that chill going down my spine, after all it is a horror book and the reason why I read them. Love it all and I loved the epic last line."
"The Dark Tower (The Dark Tower, #7)",1416524525,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.3,dreamdarkly,"I liked the series, it took me years to read it. Got interested when my high school teacher (5 yrs ago) gave me song of susannah to read. The ending isn't bad either. I bet most people don't get the ending and there for don't like it. But Stephen King gave Roland a SECOND chance. Where as he never had the horn before, he had then. That's what I believe anyways."
"The Dark Tower (The Dark Tower, #7)",1416524525,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"I haven't read another series that has captured me the way Stephen King has in this series.  I love how he created this world which is beyond my imagination. I've spent the past 4 months or so on this series, and I'm disappionted for it to end, but it was a good ending.  I was in shock on how it ended, but it was a perfect ending for this ka-tet.  The DT #7 would have to be my favorite out of the series, even though there were some parts that angered me, and drew tears, but still my favorite.  I will be reading this series again!!"
Twilight Director's Notebook : The Story of How We Made the Movie Based on the Novel by Stephenie Meyer,0316070521,Catherine Hardwicke,Barnes and Noble,4.1,GeorgeBeahm,"A pocket-sized (5.25 x 8.25 inch) hardback book, in full color, with hundreds of photographs and illustrations (including storyboards), this book delivers exactly what it promises: a ""Director's Notebook"" that tells ""the story of how we made the movie."" Hardwicke's journey on this film, as she has made clear in numerous interviews, was an adventure: shooting on location under weather conditions that included driving rain, sleet, numbing cold, or various combinations thereof, hardy Hardwicke persevered to deliver a film that far exceeded box office and studio expectations. 

This book is a behind-the-scenes look at how Hardwicke envisioned the movie from start to finish: a rare glimpse at a film maker's diary, complete with Hardwicke's own sketches (she was an architect before she became a film director), handwritten notes, candid photos from the movie, conceptual artwork, storyboards (black-and-white drawings that frame a shot for the camera), and film stills. 

The result is an intimate book, one in which Hardwicke's infectious enthusiasm makes you appreciate just how difficult it is to produce a movie--much less one shot on location under such challenging (an understatement) conditions. 

Fans who want a nuts-and-bolts ""Making of"" will certainly want to buy the authorized film book, TWILIGHT: THE COMPLETE ILLUSTRATED MOVIE COMPANION. (It's excellent, thorough, and at 8.5 x 11 inches, shows off the full color photos very well.) But this little gem belongs right next to it on the bookshelf. 

PS: It should be noted that Hardwicke chose not to helm NEW MOON because she felt the budget was inadequate and there wasn't sufficient time allowed to shoot what is obviously a more demanding (film-wise) movie than TWILIGHT. More's the pity. Chris Weitz is certainly up to the challenge, but I really felt Hardwicke's sensibilities made her the ideal choice to for all four Twilight films. 

We don't have Hardwicke on NEW MOON, but we do have this little gem of a book, which is really her extended love letter to the TWILIGHT movie, to Stephenie Meyer, and the small army of people that were mobilized to bring it to the screen."
Twilight Director's Notebook : The Story of How We Made the Movie Based on the Novel by Stephenie Meyer,0316070521,Catherine Hardwicke,Barnes and Noble,4.1,AnnieAM,"This was a pretty cool book that had some interesting information about how the novel was turned into a movie. It answered a lot of questions about the creative choices that they made while making the movie. However, I felt cheated to spend money on this when there was nothing in the book that isn't already in the extra documentary that's on the Twilight DVD's extra features. It had a few extra drawings and sketches, etc. but overall there wasn't much information in it that wasn't in the documentary. For that reason, I'd say that if you've seen the documentary, there isn't much of a point to buy this book unless (like me) you are a die-hard Twilight fan who simply must own everything Twilight :)"

"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!: Adventures of a Curious Character",0393316041,Richard Feynman,Barnes and Noble,4.2,lizzie_e,"I am a student in the 10th grade and, although I never would have picked this on my own, based on the content and the little information I knew about it before i started reading it, I really enjoyed this book! I had to read this book for my 10th grade honors physical science class, and was pleasantly surprised! I was dreading having to read it (I'm not much of a nonfiction/scientific reader, I like light reads), but this book made it interesting, not boring to read about Richard Feynman's encounters in the scientific world.The topics covered in this novel are nothing I ever would have suspected to interest me, but I was surprised to find that I did not actually mind reading this book. Basically Richard Feynman is retelling and recounting upon his most intriguing journeys and the memorable circumstances he has been in. It chronicles his life from the beginning, as Feynman shares his exciting personal experiences with you. It reads as though you and Mr. Feynman are sitting down, sharing funny, memorable stories with each other, a very smooth read. When reading, I almost forgot that I was reading this for an assignment, because of the way the information is presented in such a relaxed, casual way. It is a bit lengthy, but it's just interesting enough that you'll want to keep turning those pages until you've reached the end. I would highly recommend this to anyone, assigned or not!"
"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!: Adventures of a Curious Character",0393316041,Richard Feynman,Barnes and Noble,4.2,crazy4karate,this book is not just another book only about science. it has a lot of backround in it. i read this for a science class project and it was very entertaining. it was a book that i just kept reading and reading and i couldnt put it down! Dr. Feynman retells his life which is just so entertaining to read because he lead a full life. As i read i just gouldnt help but laugh out loud. i deffinatly recomend this book for anyone who likes science but loves a good laugh as well.
"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!: Adventures of a Curious Character",0393316041,Richard Feynman,Barnes and Noble,4.2,amy010,"A fascinating foray into the fun yet formidable physics of Mr. Feynman.  Actually, this book is less about physics and more about the life of Nobel Prize Laureate, Richard Feynman.  (Richard just rolled over in his grave; if you want to know why -- read this book!)  Once I adjusted  my expectations from education to entertainment, I absorbed every word.  He was always interesting, at times very entertaining and despite his obvious genius he had an utter lack of pretentiousness and conceit that I previously assumed afflicted all venerated scientists.  I left this book wishing for more, and feeling inspired to pursue my own adventures in curiosity.  What could I achieve if, like Richard, I abandoned my Western culture imperative of accomplishment through suffering and played with my talents in ways I felt was fun?"
"Linger (The Wolves of Mercy Falls, #2)",0545123283,Maggie Stiefvater,Barnes and Noble,4.3,theReader278,I loved reading this wonderful book! It is a story that keeps you entertained for hours.
"Linger (The Wolves of Mercy Falls, #2)",0545123283,Maggie Stiefvater,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Scarls17,"When I finished Shiver in 2009, I immediately ordered a copy and had it sent to my sister. When she finished it, she texted me and said, ""I just finished Shiver. Now I must die."" That's how Maggie Stiefvater's books work: they're so good that you're left destroyed until you can somehow manage to push the words to the back of your head until you can find the time to process what you just read.


Shiver was my absolute favorite book of 2009 so when I got the chance to read an advanced copy of Linger, I screamed. I got the package and screamed! (As a side note, I have now shot myself in the foot since I will now need to wait even longer for Forever, the third and final book in the Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy.


Linger continues where Shiver left off: Grace and Sam have finally found each other and everyone is happy and content...yeah right! Grace's parents are not happy and want to keep Grace from Sam, Sam is struggling with his past as a wolf and the friends and family he won't see again, Isabel is still dealing with the loss of her brother to the wolves, and we as the reader have to deal with Cole, an exciting and complex character.


Sometimes the 2nd of a three book series can read as just a continuation of the story with no real excitement or story arc of its own. That is NOT the case with Linger. Stiefvater brilliantly introduces new characters, voices, and plots that add to the depth of everyone we fell in love with in Shiver.


My anticipation for Shiver's sequel was like Grace's longing for Spring and Linger read like a warm day on a hammock: I loved every minute of it."
"Linger (The Wolves of Mercy Falls, #2)",0545123283,Maggie Stiefvater,Barnes and Noble,4.3,A_Good_Addiction,"Linger easily withholds the same overall tone, intensity and beauty that shone brightly in Shiver, engulfing the reader instantly. The strong characters developed in Shiver return just as vividly, their personalities pulling through and progressing more in response to new characters and situations. Maggie's characteristic, notable, highly fluid and gorgeous writing continues to lull the readers, weaving emotional, connection and intimacy throughout. She slips in stunning oxymoronic descriptions, creating an overall beautiful picture no matter the moment, setting, or emotions.

Grace, while well developed already, continues to hold her same individuality. The chapters in her POV give perfect insight, understanding easily not only her feelings for and need towards Sam but her overall view of the world. Even at her less than shining moments, Grace is a very striking character. Her strong beliefs and views, attitudes and opinions continue to forge her through the events in Linger.

Sam is impossibly more complex after the events of Shiver, learning to live and move past everything that's happened. His heart is still mending, his loyalties both bound and splitting, and his core character coming through strongly even when the POV is not his own. He is as lovable and affectionate as in Shiver, understanding both the world and Grace in surprising ways. His maturity continues to grow and be showcased, as does the depth to which he loves Grace.

Cole is a new character to the world, and one as complex and well developed as the star lovers. Sarcastic and flippant, he tests Grave and Sam and adds a certain spark to the overall tone. The reader gets an intimate look into his mind, his personality coming out at a steady pace and with the same lyrical descriptions that defines Maggie's inherent, brilliant writing. He is a strongly contrast character to many already seen and his interactions, specifically with Isabelle, are fantastic to read.

Isabelle is also back, her responses and motivations continuing to surprise the readers. She is a very give and take character, a spitfire in some areas and a follower in others. With sections now in her perspective, the reader will get an even better look at her life and views, as well as form the same intense connection with her they already feel with Sam and Grace.

The plot is surprising, playing on events hinted at and brought up in Shiver but extending them, while also adding in new ones. The full meaning of what it means to be one of these wolves, the way their lives play out, and the ultimate future of it is both beautiful and heartbreaking. The caveats, nuances and unknowns about it are also brought very much to light. There is never a dull moment, a drifting pace, or a needless scene. Everything is in there for a reason, woven together masterfully even when the reader doesn't realize it. The events pull together for a shocking, blow out ending that is magnanimously jarring.

Linger is a step above Shiver, building on an already valiant world. The overall thought, effort and detail that has gone into the entire world is showcased, as is Maggie's story telling abilities and inherent writing style. The ending is a cliff hanger, tying up some events but leaving distracting, mind-grabbing ones open for the next book."
A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,0142437344,"James Joyce, Seamus Deane",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"This James Joyce's most personal novel written about one man's impressionable childhood and follows him through to his college years as he comes to a greater understanding of individualism and intellectulal freedom and throws off the limitations of his catholic upbringing.  The novel is a masterpiece of writing style that defies time and place and becomes a book of everlasting, and everpresent importance.  The book is written in a stream of conscience style (somewhat similar to Dostoevsky but more so) that can at times be difficult to follow.  This is certainly not your typical beach reading, or grocery line novel.  A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is a terribly moving novel, but it must be read with great patience, and presence of mind.  You have to be willing to work for it to feel the true and indescribable force of this novel.  The novel is required reading for any serious reader."
A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,0142437344,"James Joyce, Seamus Deane",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"James Joyce is one of the world's greatest authors of all time. He wrote poetry and prose and, in his final book, Finnegans Wake, created his own language. This book is a great tale of Stephen Deadalus through his early life that, in analysis, provides a 'portrait' of the young James Joyce. Probably Joyce's best book for the beginner Joyce-fan, this Penguin Putnam Classic is fully annotated by an ingenious scholar to help the reader who does not understand all of Joyce's plays on words and tricks. This is essential for everyone's personal library!"
A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,0142437344,"James Joyce, Seamus Deane",Barnes and Noble,3.9,songcatchers,"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is ranked by the Modern Library as the third greatest English-language novel of the twentieth century. I have no idea why. I just found it to be extremely boring. The book is the semi-autobiographical coming of age of Stephen Dedalus, the alter ego of James Joyce. From his questions and anxiety over the roles of women and his dealings with them to his on-again-off-again struggles with religion, A Portrait of the Artist...just didn't keep my interest. It's not a bad story really but I just did not dig the prose. I haven't given up on James Joyce yet but I really hope his other books won't put me to sleep."
"The Gathering Storm (Wheel of Time, #12)",0765302306,"Robert Jordan, Brandon Sanderson",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"Unlike most other reviews here (as of this posting), I have read this book.  All of the book and not just the prologue and the first chapter.

Fans of the Wheel of Time series will not be disappointed with The Gathering Storm.  Unlike some of the books since Lord of Chaos, there is a satisfactory conclusion to an important plot line in this book (no spoilers).  There is clear movement towards Tarmon Gai'don.  No more burying major characters under roof beams and leaving them there for a full book.  While not all characters are visited, you still put the book down feeling that something momentous had happened and you don't feel the lack of particular story lines.  Instead of feeling as if I had just briefly flitted from character to character without accomplishing anything, this book provides a sense of satisfaction that has been missing from some of the prior Wheel of Time novels. (That is not a knock on the prior books, The Gathering Storm would not feel as satisfactory without the build up provided by the books that preceded it.)

I will say that I was worried at the beginning of the Prologue.  It certainly does not start with a bang, but it does set the tone for the book.  However, by the end of the prologue I knew that this was a book where something exciting was going to happen and wanted to continue reading.

It is also worth noting that Sanderson has done a wonderful job of preserving the writing style of the previous books.  Is this book somewhat different from Jordan's original books?  Yes, most notably, the pacing is a bit faster.  It is debatable, however, whether that is a function of Sanderson's style or the fact that the plot is coming to a head.

This book is a worthy and welcome addition to the Wheel of Time series.  Although it is sad that Robert Jordan could not write all of it himself, The Gathering Storm is a fantastic addition to his legacy."
"The Gathering Storm (Wheel of Time, #12)",0765302306,"Robert Jordan, Brandon Sanderson",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Gaidin,"to be honest I just expected this book to finish the storyline and tie up loose ends without jordans flair. yes i read chapter 1 and the prolouge early and was not that impressed. At tor .com i listened to the audio of chapter 2 early and i think this is where the book gets rolling. For all of you who say it doesn't read like robert jordan please read the whole book first. I just finished the book and i an back waiting for the next one as eagerly as ever. Yes the chrachters seem a little different at first but within a few chapters they blend almost seemlessly. I feel the reason people dislike the first few chapters is that a large number of new charachters are  are thrown at you which makes the book feel unfamiliar but as the book continues I felt like it was one of the better books in the series. This one feels like the early books in that the story actually moves forward at a good pace and you actually feel like it goes somewhere. The later books by jordan were great but slowed in momentum and just seemed to leave more unfinished storylines after every book. Finally after 19 years of reading the wheel of time countless times 
( at least 10 times minimum) I feel the end coming and know it will be an ending of heroic proportions. Brandon Sanderson has done the monumental task of stepping into the giant shadow cast by Robert Jordan and from reviews I have read no one seems to think him worthy after reading only 1 or 2 chapters. Well for all you who made a hasty judgement please read the whole book and then decide. I feel Brandon Sanderson deserves great praise for this book and he has definately deserves a thank you from all wheel of time fans for stepping into the breach and finishing the story we all wanted to know the ending to.Now as all wheel of time fans are used to doing i will wait another year for the next book in that end. Yep definately feels like Robert Jordan."
"The Gathering Storm (Wheel of Time, #12)",0765302306,"Robert Jordan, Brandon Sanderson",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"I forgot within 20 pages that I wasn't reading something entirely written by Robert Jordan, and that was what had worried me most.  Mr. Sanderson does a wonderful job of MOVING the story along without getting dragged down into the weeds too much.  The pace is fairly quick for a story with so many characters, and several answers are provided in this book that give closure to questions that have loomed for four or five books."
Middlemarch,0451529170,"George Eliot, Michel Faber",Barnes and Noble,4.1,lraber224,"Do NOT waste your money on this edition of Middlemarch. There are seriously at least 50 typos that I found. Misspelled words, character names switched, missing punctuation. I've never seen anything like it. It was terribly distracting. B&N and the editor of this edition should be so ashamed. Your money and time will be much better spent on another edition."
Middlemarch,0451529170,"George Eliot, Michel Faber",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"I can understand how some readers might become overwhelmed by the 700 plus pages that make up this classic but its well worth the read. George Eliot reminds me of an Austen or Bronte, but with a little more spunk. Everything doesn't always work out perfectly for Eliot's characters and their lives are more complicated and true to life. Dr. Lydgate and Dorthea begin with the best of intentions but their ambitions are soon spoiled through their own folly and misjudgement. The book is a great depiction of human strenghths and weaknesses set in a climate of strict social heirarchy."
Middlemarch,0451529170,"George Eliot, Michel Faber",Barnes and Noble,4.1,HBW,"This edition of Middlemarch has one of the best introductions to a classic I've ever read--clearly written, informative and free of the pompous nonsense you usually see in these (definitely read it after reading the novel, though; it gives away all the plot points). Because of this alone, I'd say this edition is more than worth the money. On the other hand, it did have a good number of typos. The book was apparently scanned with optical character recognition, judging by their nature. I found it readable, but if you're a stickler for such things, you might want to avoid this edition. Another drawback was the footnotes. They were too sparse, and a handful weren't properly tagged to jump to the footnote section. These aren't fatal flaws, but they keep reminding you you're not reading a top-notch edition. Still, for the money, I'm not sure you could do better."

I won't get into too much detail, because I don't want to spoil it for you, but if you haven't read it yet, do so, and start with The Hobbit.
The Hobbit itself is a children's book.  Quite briefly, if covers a quest of 13 dwarves trying to recover a lost treasure stolen from them ages ago by a dragon.  That dragon was still there, but the dwarves, aided by a wizard, Gandalf, helps them on their journey.  What they needed was a burglar, and they stop at the place of an unsuspecting hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, a sheltered, peace loving hobbit who like to garden and eat food.  He is coerced on the quest and encounters many adventures with the dwarves to recapture the treasure from the dragon, Smaug.  
On the way, the dwarves are captured by goblins in the Misty Mountains.  Bilbo gets lost, and finds a ring;  a magic ring that makes him invisible.  A creature named Gollum had it, but Bilbo uses it to escape the goblins and keeps the rings, to Gollum's ire.  ""Thief, Baggins, thief.  We hates it, forever.""
The story continues, and after his adventure, Bilbo returns home with his magic ring, thinking his adventure has come to an end.
The Lord of the Rings is an adult book.  It is 50 years later, and BIlbo has taken in his nephew, Frodo Baggins, to live with him.  It is discovered that the ring has powers way beyond making one invisible, and that was not the purpose of its making.  When Gandalf finds out its true nature, he tells Frodo, and Frodo, surprised, realizes that he, and the Shire where he lives is in grave danger, and that he must undertake a quest to save the Shire...and the rest of Middle Earth.
I will leave it here, but read the books, in their proper order.  You'll be amazed.
The reason I bought these were that I liked the covers.  When the series first came out in paperback, the covers were colorfully illustrated by Barbara Remington, and that's how I imagined them.  In 1973, after Tolkien died, they changed them to include his own drawings.  From 1979 onwards, they would change the covers again and again, but I never liked any of them.  Now, a new artist caught the feel of the story, and did some excellent painting, each corresponding and fitting each volume:  Bilbo leaving his hobbit hole, boating down the River Anduin, the two towers of Isengard and Morder, and Mt. Doom itself, all colorfully and lavishly illustrated in their front covers.
I hope they keep these for a long time to come.  This is an excellent edition to buy.  
Again, if you haven't read the series, do so.  You'll be taken away to another world."
J.R.R. Tolkien 4-Book Boxed Set: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings,0345538374,J.R.R. Tolkien,Barnes and Noble,4.7,KarinaLove1,"Im so happy that I purchased this Lovely book set, the books give hours of fun and exciting adventures to read, Once you pick up a book and start reading you won't want to put it down,  I really Love and  Appreciate  the writing and story telling from J.R.R. Tolkien"
"Thoughtless (Thoughtless, #1)",146109111X,S.C. Stephens,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"So I'll start by saying this the book started as a solid 5 star read for me. Before I even began, I was convinced I was in for a damn good read. The premise was excellent and hen all the great reviews I was stoked!

 As I started reading I felt there was way too much info dump but then I thought okay maybe it's just that I'm anxious to see how the love triangle begins since Denny is so wonderful. How would it even be possible? I started skimming to get to the juicy part of the story. And the writer delivered. I had noticed how often Kiera blushed but it didn't really bother at first because I thought maybe that's her cute quirk. Heroine's often have one. Obviously she blushes A LOT. But by the time she'd blushed about 20 times The story went from a solid 5 to a weak 5.

 But the story was still good. So 5 it stayed. Then I started noticing the author's love of adverbs. At first, it was in all the tags which I find to be VERY weak writing. The author chooses to tell me how everyone said everything rather than show me.

He said cautiously. 
I said softly. 
I smiled goofily. <- really? 

After about, I don't know, 30 of these and the read had gone done to a 4 star. But the story still had me. So I read on. The more I read the more the excessive use of adverbs began to irritate me and at this point I began to roll my eyes at the amount of time Kiera blushed and blushed deeply. Note to author you can't say ""I blushed"" because no one can see themselves blush. However instead of TELLING the reader she blushed you could've (especially since she did it so often, many times at things that didn't even warrant blushing) you could show us. ""I felt my cheeks warn."" ""The heat rushed to my face."" But no, the author took the annoyingly lazy way out and chose to tell us about every single time she blushed or blushed deeply.

 It seems as the story went on (which could've been so much shorter and written much tighter if SO much of the unnecessary details would have been left out.) The authors love of adverbs grew as passionately <- heh as Kiera and Kellans love did. The adverbs became more blatant. And were suddenly EVERYWHERE and even more than once in a single sentence like in this offensive one. 
He smiled goofily as he tilted his head adorably. uugh!

 We're down to 3 stars now folks. Every adverb at this point made me cringe, which meant I never stopped cringing! 

Then as if that weren't enough the author just began to repeat the same ones over and over. 
He looked at me icily then turned coldly. 
Dangerously 
Uncertainly 
I said moodily. <- are you kidding me?! I almost screamed at that one! lol 

VERY lazy writing when the you choose to just say angrily rather than try to come up with a more creative way to show he was angry. ""He stomped away, red faced slamming the door behind him."" Nope, it's much easier to just tell us he left angrily!!! 

I was generous with the half star. After I read the consequences I'd had enough and didn't even finish. Sad because the story had such promise."
"Thoughtless (Thoughtless, #1)",146109111X,S.C. Stephens,Barnes and Noble,4.5,lovergirlOS,loved fifty shades of grey and then I read beautiful disaster and I kept reading books in the hopes that I would find another book that was like one of these two and this book was FANTASTIC and In my opinion it was better than beautiful disaster! If anyone was like me and you loved fifty shades or beautiful disaster then you need to read this book ASAP!!!!
"Thoughtless (Thoughtless, #1)",146109111X,S.C. Stephens,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Eroticalover1,"Kira starts out as a solid character and then just falls a part. I mean if I can get through all the blushes and  heated checks I made me so sick in the end I wanted to gag. This book takes way ,way too long to get to where it's going. Your really fine with screwing you boyfriend's best friend when he's away and then he comes back. You start sleeping with your boyfriend meanwhile your kissing and snuggling with his best friend but that's okay as long as your not having sex with him it's okay. Really? I would have loved this book if Kira and kellan had a juicy affair behind  Denny's back. This book is like bad Fanficton. . read Beautiful Disaster instead."
Cleopatra: A Life,0316001929,Stacy Schiff,Barnes and Noble,3.4,TracyHodson,"""Cleopatra: A Life"" is not scholarly enough to qualify as a biography--there simply isn't enough information extant about Cleopatra to fill a 300+ page book. All her sources wrote well past Cleopatra's time, or were Roman enemies. Schiff acknowledges the almost total lack of reliable information right from the start, but can't quite overcome the enormity of that obstacle. Her prose is often stilted as she fills pages with everything but Cleopatra's life. We learn what her education probably consisted of, what the people of Alexandria ate and therefore what Cleopatra probably ate; she fills page after page with sentences beginning with ""she probably"", ""she may have,"" ""she might have,"" ""we can guess she..."" This becomes both frustrating and tedious to read. The first half of the book deals with all but the last years of Cleopatra's life, the ten years with Antony, but as there is next to nothing known of these years, there's next to no substance being covered here. Schiff gives a lively picture of Alexandria, and a great deal of time is spent reading Cicero's denunciations of Cleopatra, but there's nothing new, nothing of very great interest, very little ""biography."" The second half of the book is about the years with Antony, and is dedicated to the exploration of that most intriguing of relationships, though Schiff doesn't seem to subscribe to the idea of theirs being a great romance. She doesn't really seem to have a point of view about many things, including the source of Cleopatra's great power over two of the greatest men of her age. Instead, she presents various accounts about all the major events of the last ten years of Cleopatra's life, during which she was Antony's faithful lover and mother to three children by him in addition to her son, Caesarion, by Julius Caesar (his only son and only living child), and Antony's eldest children by an early marriage. The details of their life together-as much as can be known-are covered well, and the tension mounts as they plummet headlong into war and the final, fatal, showdown with Octavian. All of this is well-written and interesting to read; clearly, when Ms. Schiff has something to write about, she writes well. And this is a story worth telling-- whether Cleopatra and Antony partnered out of passion, or politics, or both, it is certainly one of the great couplings of all time. The bewildering and disastrous Battle of Actium, Cleopatra's building of her own Mausoleum, Antony's botched suicide and subsequent death in Cleopatra's arms are the stuff of high opera. Octavian's cold, ruthless gamesmanship versus Cleopatra's determined, intelligent survivalism made for a dramatic end-game, regardless of the veracity of the varying accounts (poison or an unlikely, very handy, cobra? Cleopatra's suicide or murder by Octavian?). In the end the book is neither scholarly enough to qualify as a biography, nor well-enough presented to qualify as a good read. Schiff reads no Greek or Latin, and does not appear to have traveled to any of the areas she's written about or visited museums to talk with scholars or to see artifacts that may have helped her to get a real handle on her subject. There is no new information, and Schiff gets a bit side-tracked by her irritation with Liz Taylor for having played Cleopatra on screen, hardly an important detail for a serious biographer. There seems to be a great deal of effort going into promoting this book, but it just isn't a very creditable effort."
Cleopatra: A Life,0316001929,Stacy Schiff,Barnes and Noble,3.4,FeatheredQuillBookReviews,"Full disclosure: My Ph.D. dissertation (Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, 1976) was an examination of the persona of Cleopatra in the plays in English about her from 1592 to 1898, including the famous plays by Shakespeare, Dryden, and Shaw. While Stacy Schiff uses the same resources I did-primarily the Roman and early Christian propagandists-she also has the advantage of books published as recently as 2008. The level of her scholarship is one thing that makes this book so good. It includes maps of Alexandria and the Mediterranean world in Cleopatra's day, extensive notes, and color plates of statues and coins that show us what the queen may have looked like. Some years ago there was a movement to reclaim ancient Egypt's people and civilization for sub-Saharan Africa. It's possible that the pyramid builders were black Africans, but Cleopatra was no more Egyptian, Schiff writes, than Elizabeth Taylor. The queen was Macedonian Greek. The founder of the Ptolemaic Dynasty was a childhood friend of Alexander the so-called Great and founder of the great city of Alexandria (which is now mostly under water). The Ptolemies engaged not only in patricide, matricide, fratricide, and sororicide, but also in incest; in the opening chapters of Cleopatra, Schiff untangles the history and shenanigans of this dynasty, which puts the Borgias to shame, and describes its long and troubled relationship with the Roman Republic. Cleopatra is most famous, of course, for her love affairs with two of the most famous and more or less noblest Romans. Julius Caesar put her back on her throne in about 48 BCE after she'd been exiled by her brother (Ptolemy XIII) and his henchmen. She was in Rome in 44 when Caesar was assassinated and sailed home to Alexandria soon after the Ides of March. She probably met Mark Antony in Rome, but she didn't engage his interest until after he and Octavian (Caesar's heir) had dispatched Brutus and Cassius at Philippi in Asia Minor. Antony now summoned the queen to Tarsus. The events of the final years of Cleopatra's life, from the Donations of Alexandria (late 34) until her death in 30, were enormously complex. Schiff meticulously combs through the ancient sources to distinguish Roman propaganda from history. At the Donations, Antony gave Cleopatra the title Queen of Kings, promoted Caesarion to King of Kings, and gave their three children lands from Parthia (now northern Iran) to Cyrenaica (now Libya). To say the Donations angered Octavian is a vast understatement; the Roman civil war blazed up again and was not quenched until, following the battle of Actium in 31 from which the queen so famously sailed away, the Romans invaded Egypt and Antony and Cleopatra both killed themselves. With the death of the richest woman in the world, Octavian had no more competition. He renamed himself Augustus and founded the Roman Empire. Quill says: After you've read this beautifully researched and historically accurate biography, have some fun. Rent the bloated 1963 Elizabeth Taylor movie. Play film critic. Comment on the historical errors, the anachronisms, and the utter nonsense."
Cleopatra: A Life,0316001929,Stacy Schiff,Barnes and Noble,3.4,bookiecookie,"With all the hype surrounding a Pulitzer-prize-winning author coupled with my curiousity concerning this historical figure, I bought this book with great anticipation.  However, I really struggled to get through it and I am a person that will generally read -- and get something out of -- just about anything.  The synopsis of the book as presented in the BN listing tells just about as much as the entire book does and your high school classes in Ancient History tells you the rest.  I think I even learned more from Elizabeth Taylor.......  

While Schiff's research may be impeccable, it is a thumping bore to get through and at the end, we still don't learn much about Cleopatra that we didn't already know.  I wasn't expecting a tabloid page-turner but I also wasn't expecting a book that took such effort to just reach the end.  I can't honestly recommend it....."
The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century,0374292795,Thomas L. Friedman,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Bush_Man,"The book The World is Flat, by Thomas Friedman, is non-fiction, insightful book mainly about the author¿s personal experiences with the leveling of the world¿s communication and information transfer. Friedman explains to the reader through his experiences, a brief history of the 21st Century.  He outlines the world¿s flattening into three eras of globalization, ¿Globalization 1.0 was countries globalizing and the dynamic force in Globalization 2.0 was companies globalizing, the dynamic force in Globalization 3.0 ¿ the thing that gives it its unique character ¿ is the newfound power for individuals to collaborate and compete globally (10).¿  He explains the shifting of the world, from being isolated geographically, to a more integrated world that is dependant on the resources and information that countries around the world supply. ""It unlocked half the planet and made citizens there our potential partners and competitors (441).¿   The book helps the reader to understand the transition from the age of industry to the age of technology.	To better understand the man behind the book it is important to know about him. He is a very accomplished writer that won the three Pulitzer Prize for commentary for the New York Times, and has written: From Beirut to Jerusalem in 1989, The Lexus and the Olive Tree in 2000, Longitudes and Attitudes: The World in the Age of Terrorism in 2002, and Israel: A Photo biography. Most of which have won awards for best non-fiction or foreign policy. Most of Friedman¿s writings are based off the ideals of globalization, especially The World is Flat.	Thomas Friedman explains, in The World is Flat, how the world has shifted economically as far as the workforce because of the increasing need for math, science and technology as tools for progress, and the ability through technology for the United States to compete globally.  Through capitalism companies want to maximize their profits by hiring the most qualified people for the job with the least amount of money.  This is the whole concept of outsourcing and why American jobs are leaving the country.  In his book he says, ¿This is what I mean when I say the world has been flattened.  It is the contemporary convergence of the ten flatteners, creating this new global playing field for multiple forms of collaboration (177).¿ I feel that this is one hundred percent true and that the author did an excellent job of providing many examples and in depth analysis. There are many options that a business owner looks at and the clear choice in every scenario is to hire the smartest people to offer the highest quality product with the lowest labor cost possible.  This is shown throughout history that business owners always make the cheapest choice possible, even when it isn¿t morally right.  The whole concept of slavery or child labor is to maximize profit, even though we all know it is morally wrong.  Outsourcing isn¿t necessarily wrong.  It¿s just a smart business decision based on keeping labor costs down and today¿s technology allows companies to employ people across the world as though they were in the same building.  Proving my point Friedman explains, ¿Wages and rents in Bangalore are less than one fifth of what they are in those Western capitals (18).¿	Over all, I thought it was a very informative book that gives the reader a different perspective of how the different technologies that we take for granted now, like computers and internet are shaping the world.

Friedman,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Guest,"As I entered my freshman year of college I  was nervous, excited and I was ready to start fresh. My first day my Buiness Professor was talking about the cirrculum and mentioned that we should all take a look at this book. For some reason I took his advice and read this book that is some 600 plus pages'I never read prior to this unless force'.I did it not cause I was forced to but I wanted to learn and that is what Friedman tries getting across IQ,PQ,CQ Chapters. I am only 19 years old but I currently work in a hotel that caters to Multi Million dollar buisness such as EMC Corp and Waters Corp and I got to witness first hand that globalziation indeed is no joke and something we should not take lightly. I often interacted with many people from China,Japan,and India and I often found myself asking them how they felt about Globlization. All of them embraced it because it is a chance for these people to take what they learn bring it home and build on it. Globalization is nothing we should fear it something we should embrace.I also work with three India interns all of them have a work ethic like no other and they have that drive to be better. They could not understand why us americans throw away all the oppurtinutes we have,he told me to ask a child parents what it means to be an engineer or doctor and you will understand why we work everyday to get better. I am now going into my sophmore year of College and you best believe I am going to work study and network more than ever.If I dont I know that someone in China or India is this should be a serious reality check to all young adults. I am not saying stay in and study your life away cause this is where I think these international students lose their edge is with their shyness.

"Steelheart (The Reckoners, #1)",0385743564,Brandon Sanderson,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"Literary genius Brandon Sanderson is easily the best author of his time, comparable only to Patrick Rothfuss and a few other select modern writers.  Steelheart, like all his books; is original, intelligent, and perfectly written. Sanderson doesn't jusy copy Tolkien or stick to the same recipe as other writers are content to do. Some may complain about the size of his novels but he has shown he can produce excellent work regardless of the number of pages in the book. Steelheart was an excellent read and i'd recommend it and all of Sanderson's works to anyone that can read. My only complaint is having to wait for book 2 of The Stormlight Archive series. Keep up the excellent work Brandon!"

"The Happiness Project: Or Why I Spent a Year Trying to Sing in the Morning, Clean My Closets, Fight Right, Read Aristotle, and Generally Have More Fun",0061583251,Gretchen Rubin,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Anonymous,"Anyone who knows me well knows that I love a great self-help book. There are a plethora of these titles in any bookstore, and unfortunately, many of them are just too abstract for the everyday person. What makes ""The Happiness Project"" so wonderful is that anyone can relate. Who doesn't want to be happy?

One year, Gretchen Rubin decides to forego the specific New Year's resolutions that so many of us break by January 3rd. Eat right, exercise more, watch less TV, blah, blah, blah. Instead, she decides that she wants to become happier. To accomplish this, she decides on 12 specific areas where she would like to become happier in her life, and then sets mini-goals for herself each month. For example, the area to be happier in May is ""Leisure"". Rubin's goals in May are find more fun, take time to be silly, go off the path, and start a collection.

I found myself laughing, nodding my head with understanding, and ""Ah-hah-ing"" at almost every page. I found the month about contemplating the heavens to be most profound. To be happier, read memoirs of catastrophe?? Yes, if you want to be happy with and appreciate what you have, read the diaries of people who have just been diagnosed with cancer or survived a plane crash. Maybe the little things in life (Why isn't he going the speed limit?) won't bother you as much. 

Journal writing is way too overwhelming for me to do each day. Rubin suggests a one-sentence journal, where you write one thing that happened that day that you never want to forget. It's the little things like these that make this book joyous to read and makes you think about starting your own happiness project. Don't worry, be _____.

"The Happiness Project: Or Why I Spent a Year Trying to Sing in the Morning, Clean My Closets, Fight Right, Read Aristotle, and Generally Have More Fun",0061583251,Gretchen Rubin,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Anonymous,"What a wonderful book to start the new year with, especially after a year like 2009, and no surprise that it's been chosen by Oprah's book club. Rubin's project can easily become your own as it's filled with practical tips, without being preachy, that anyone could do.  This is much more than self-help; it's a compulsively readable narrative, thanks to Gretchen's funny and insightful anecdotes (which also examine her shortcomings and failures alongside the happier successes) and thoughtful research ranging from Aristotle and Tolstoy to Ben Franklin and Samuel Johnson.

It was really hard to get into because I felt like the author made it seem way too hard to be happy. The amount of research she did (and mentioned constantly) made me feel like I was reading a textbook at times. Near the middle of book, I began to like the author for being candid and honest.  I realized that her happiness project worked for her and I saw how others could be inspired by her.  Personally, I wrote down 3 things I wanted to do in the next year to make myself happier-organize my house, be nicer to my husband, and enjoy the time I do get to myself.  So overall, I got her message. I did not love the book, but I can see why others who need a little inspiration would."
The Man in the High Castle,0679740678,Philip K. Dick,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,"I don't like alternate history stories, dating back, I think, to when I was a kid and I read those stupid 'What If...' issues published by Marvel Comics.  (You know, 'What If Peter Parker hadn't been bitten by the radioactive spider...,''What If Daredevil wasn't blind...,''What If Wolverine shaved his sideburns...,' etc.)  The Man in the High Castle, however, was excellent, setting the bar for the genre.  The premise is intriguing: suppose an assassination attempt had claimed the life of FDR during his first term as president.  As a result, America never fully recovered from the Great Depression, and was unable to arm herself sufficiently to turn the tide of WWII.  As a result, the Axis powers were victorious, and occupied a divided United States after the war.  Dick ties together his diverse cast of characters with a common fascination with 'The Grasshopper Lies Heavy,' an alternative history book that suggests the Allies would have won the war had FDR lived.  Dick's central theme through most of his work has always been the nature of reality and perception, and this book is no exception.  This is not a book to skim through for the major plot points -- the plot is actually the least compelling reason to read it.  Savor the meditative and philosophical prose instead, and enjoy one of the genre's finest authors in his prime."
The Man in the High Castle,0679740678,Philip K. Dick,Barnes and Noble,3.7,tickleishpickle,"There are books out there that don't just challenge the reader, there are books that change the reader.

The man in the high castle, by philip k dick is one of those books. This book, like all of dick's writing, is revolutionary. It is challenging. It is completely and utterly bizzare. It is unique, difficult, simple, readable, entertaining, schizophrenic and so much more than any set of adjectives can covey.

This book is not about the plot. It's about what the plot means. The plot, like all of dick's novels, is cohesive and interesting and detailed. It is fully realized and detailed; it is completely authentic. In this world, the axis wins WW 2. The world that results is a world where Japan and Germany have divided the world in two, with the United States serving the role of Germany after our version of WW2. Japan dominates the west coast while Germany lords over the east. Apparently the heartland of America had nothing to offer to either side.

Jokes aside (especially bad jokes), this novel is an utterly amazing and philosophical exploration of the impact of morality on each and every choice. It uses the chaos of the plot to accentuate the moral decisions made by each character. In fact the chaos of the world this novel takes place in works as a sort of synecdoche for each person and each person's choices. The whole world is difficult, and each event impacts a web of other events. The world and it's events mirror each individual person, they stand in the place of each individual person. The plot unfolds through the narration of five people, ranging in importance from a low level worker to an important German politician. Each person makes choices, and each choice has a moral consequence.

The Man in the High Castle,0679740678,Philip K. Dick,Barnes and Noble,3.7,theactuallisakim,"I'm pretty shocked by some of the negative reviews here.  The word that controls most of these reviews is 'boring,' which is odd.  I suppose for a generation unable to watch a film that doesn't have an explosion of some sort within the first minute of the movie, a book like this might seem boring (then again, maybe we should be happy that Generation No Attention Span even bothered to pick up a book in the first place!)

This is one of the books PKD is best known for.  With good reason.  For those of you who didn't ""get"" what PKD's point was, he is simply asking you to question everything you are told about who the winners and losers in a war are.  I think the end of this book is one of the most chilling, disturbing conclusions I have ever read. Literally gave me goosebumps.  Then again, I can focus on something for more than three minutes at a time, so maybe, in this day and age, I'm some sort of freak!"

I checked out the paper book while at Barnes and Noble.  The photos are not grotesque.  Certain aspects of the crime scene photos are prudently obscured.  But what I found fascinating were the photos of the young women who committed the murders.  Fresh-faced teenage girls smile out from the pages.  Manson looks like a feral leprechaun and one wonders why anyone would follow him anywhere much less murder for him.  The inclusion of the photos in the (not inexpensive) ebook version would have made this a better product."

These are important to the story and i was very disappointed to find them not available."
"Shadow of Night (All Souls Trilogy, #2)",0670023485,Deborah Harkness,Barnes and Noble,4.3,kimba88,"The tale literal picks up right where Discovery of Witches left off. Diana and Matthew find themselves landing back in Elizabethan London. Diana is thrilled to be able to visit a period she has studied but finds herself woefully unprepared. She quickly realizes that even with her education she is completely out of her element. From her speech to her mannerism it is obvious to all; she isn&rsquo;t from around here. With the aid of Matthew&rsquo;s eccentric friends, they will work to assist Diana with these skills, secure a witch to train her and find the lost copy of Asmole 782. The tale that unfolds is absolutely breathtaking, filled with suspense, romance, danger and iconic characters throughout Elizabethan history. The characters are flawed, fleshed out and I absolutely adore them. Diana finds herself out of her element. Her witchcraft is acting all sorts of bonkers. She is living in a time when witches are burned at the stake, the clothes are barbaric and women have no rights. In this novel we get to see tremendous growth in Diana. Her love and understanding of Matthew grows. She becomes more confident in her own skin and continues to be loyal, fearless and stubborn. I loved watching her discover her talents as a witch. This provides both funny and frightening scenes as her inability to control them creates mayhem. Then of course there is Matthew *swoons*. In this novel we learn so much about him and what has molded the modern day version. His history is both fascinating and sad. We get to see a darker side of Matthew as he confronts his past. He loves Diana but things are holding him back. I loved discovering his inner-workings. Diana peeled back his layers, bringing them closer together. The soft, tender side of Matthew was beautiful. There are a few flash forwards to present time and the characters we love. This provides insight into how Matthew and Diana are changing the future. We spend most of the novel in the years 1950 and 1951. This affords us the opportunity to witness history, attend the queen, and meet many historical characters. Harkness did a fantastic job of weaving them in the tale and giving them voice. I adored getting to know Gallowglass and Matthew&rsquo;s father. The Queen and other characters gave me the chills and I feared for Diana. Harkness has an incredible gift for world-building. She brought the Elizabethan era to life. Her interpretation of the queen, the atmosphere, and the smells of London lifted the tale right from the pages and I become completely immersed. It is immediately evident that a tremendous amount of research went into writing this novel. I was delighted by the historical accuracy and believability. From the buildings, merchants and furnishing, Harkness's imagery was enthralling. The characters she introduced were fleshed-out, and my feelings toward them reflected that. Shadow of Night held my attention and kept me up late two evening in a row, but it was worth every sleep-deprived minute. Harkness spun twists and turns into the plot that completely captivating me. We travel all over Europe and I loved all the little details. The fear of discovery and the atmosphere of the times, especially towards witches made this tale very suspenseful. The romance between Diana and Matthew was genuine and beautifully portrayed. Thanks to Viking for providing a finished copy in exchange for my unbiased review"
"Shadow of Night (All Souls Trilogy, #2)",0670023485,Deborah Harkness,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"SOME SPOILERS!  

As a university writing professor of 20+ years, a rabid reader, and  history buff, I find Harkness to be one of the more frustrating writers I've encountered. An obviously brilliant historian with  terrific ideas, her books have enough originality and intrigue to hook me--until I'm reduced to screaming frustration by the weak (or absent) editing, inconsistent characters and ""Twilight"" For 
Academia plotlines. I was SO hoping ""Shadow"" would improve upon ""Discovery"", but I don't think it does in any major way. Like ""Discovery,"" ""Shadow"" has the makings of a terrific novel; I can see that novel; I just can't get to it:

1. ""Discovery"" desperately needed to be cut by half; while shorter, ""Shadow""  still needs to be cut in half. After a conscise, fast start, the novel goes  off the rails as it progresses.  HOW many times must we be told Matthew and Diane have no more secrets only to be told, oops, there's more?  How many references to Matthew's stalkerish possessiveness, his astounding beauty, their star-crossed obssession  and her inept magic do we need? WAY too many characters, plotlines, secret organizations, obscure or cliched historical references (Dracula? really?) Must Matthew have some connection with all historical figures (major and minor) of the last 1,500 years? An awful, uneplained death at the end comes out of nowhere  and reads like an overly obvious attempt at ""shocking cliffhanger."" The last 200 pages cram in so much ""stuff"" (Diana's dad?!), I felt like tbe author was trying to use every. single. idea. she had. Edit!!

2. One plus is that the inane,infuriating ""Twilight"" parallels that show up via  plot and character in ""Discovery"" are, somewhat, toned down. Diana has some backbone--mercifully not as much fainting, sleeping, being carried around, and following Matthew's every command--but we're still stuck with the icky half-vampire baby plotline and way too many simpering ""ma couer"" dialogue points.

Worse, common sense alludes these supposed geniuses consisently. After showing some spunk and real intellect, Diane then does incredibly stupid things, repeatedly, like deliberately exposing herself to dangerous creatures, being surprised when they find her and want her dead, while apparently forgetting her past history of torture, abuse and being in the 16th century to HIDE.  

Matthew is TOO much: too Byronic, too James Bond meets Lancelot, yet  not smart enough to realize that yes, if you time travel, you're probably going to alter history and run into people you shouldn't or don't want to: like your dead father and crazed sister.  

 
3. Not consummating the affair was one of ""Discovery's"" most annoying points--it finally happens here but we have to wait almost 200 pages and the circumstances (Matthew's father basically ordering it) are kind of cringe-worthy. However, the sex scenes do have some fun steaminess and eroticism. 

4. The Ashmole search unbelievably disappears for long stretches while the lovers do other things and give the search over to secondary characters who, every 100 pgs or so,pop in to say it's still missing. It only becomes important again almost 3/4 of the way thru.  There are supposedly reasons for this--but I didn't care by the time I got there.

Deborah Harkness has a sexy, fascinating, fun novel in here SOMEWHERE but this isn't it. Sh"
"Shadow of Night (All Souls Trilogy, #2)",0670023485,Deborah Harkness,Barnes and Noble,4.3,booksonmynook,I loved this book. very well written. Finished it very quickly
Leaving Time,0345544927,Jodi Picoult,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,I am a Jodi Picoult fan and this is definately my favorite so far. I loved the relationships between the people and the elephants. Just when I thought I had the story figured out there would be a new revolation which would again leave me guessing.  This is just a great book!
Leaving Time,0345544927,Jodi Picoult,Barnes and Noble,4,Panther18,"Yes, Jodi has obviously done a great deal of research on elephants, but if you think that this is just a &quot;Discovery Channel&quot; episode on 
elephants, WOW! You sure don't know Jodi Picoult very well. Think outside the box a little and read between the lines. By giving us so 
many details about the &quot;humanity&quot; of elephants, she is able to draw many parallels between the mother and daughter characters in her
book. I think her book is thought provoking and beautifully written."
Leaving Time,0345544927,Jodi Picoult,Barnes and Noble,4,NonniD,"I had a hard time getting into this book for the first 50 pages or so. I had read the short story ""Where There's Smoke"" so I really wanted to stick with it. Meanwhile I read some of the reviews on BN/Nook and was so bummed and mad at the rude person who added a blatant spoiler in her first few sentences with no warning. Because I love Jodi Picoult so much I kept at it and soon was hooked. I loved every minute after that, even learning so much about elephants, which caused others to think the book was boring. I found that part interesting and I think it's wonderful that Jodi used her status as an author to bring light on the true horrors still happening to elephants every day and all over the world. In the end the spoiler didn't matter and I loved it and still was surprised in spite of what I knew!"
"Moon Called (Mercy Thompson, #1)",0441013813,Patricia Briggs,Barnes and Noble,4.5,SirBunch,"Despite being a strong, contemporary,  female lead character Mercy Thompson is not overly feminist. Briggs has created a gutsy, true-to-life type of female protagonist which is rare. Beyond that the book is fun to read, well paced, littered with laughs, and entertaining. I'm going to read the rest of the series for sure."
"Moon Called (Mercy Thompson, #1)",0441013813,Patricia Briggs,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Xedra77,"OK, I know, that's a cheesy title for a review, but I hate trying to pick out titles for these things.  That's probably why I'm an avid reader, instead of a writer.  I read about a book a day these days, mostly stuff that makes my husband tease.  There was no hurrying through this book, though.  It was so different from the rest, and totally lacking in anything resembling smut, that it had to be savored slowly.

Mercy is such a real, and totally developed character that I found myself looking at the cover and wondering who that was they had drawn - it certainly wasn't the character the Briggs described.  Being the only one of her kind that she knows of, Mercy is a strong, independent woman despite being raised, and almost constantly surrounded by the pack.  I love the way she handles the men in her life thoroughly and, amazingly, shows them that she can overcome all of the things that they see as her weaknesses.  

I laughed out loud when she walked out of the trailer at the end leaving them both behind.  Serves them right.  I'd explain better, but you really need to read this one for yourself."
"Moon Called (Mercy Thompson, #1)",0441013813,Patricia Briggs,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Kasia_S,"I wasn't sure what to expect from Briggs after reading so much praise for her books but it didn't take long to feel as if I passed out and woke up in werewolf heaven. Anyone who knows me, knows that I love werewolf anything so this was such a treat, totally unexpected because urban fantasy these days is such a wide mix, usually with witches and vampires with a wolf here and there, but this beast of a book has teeth, muscle, wit, charm and plenty of brawn. Briggs did an incredible job of floating the reader in a sea of incredibly perceptive werewolf folklore that was simply stunning and extremely interesting and she made it feel primordial and Earthy, the instincts, thrills and even some passion was intelligent and very deep. This book is merely a perception that its fantasy and fun, everything reads so realistically that I had a hard time believing that this world was made up. It was a lot to get through as the plot thickened very quickly, the main heroine had no other choice but to plunge and run wild with the pack and troubles never seemed to stay far behind.Basically this novel is about Mercedes, a seemingly young girl (you never know how old those creatures really are) that can turn into a coyote at will. An echo of Native American folklore runs thorough the tale as she keeps herself busy running a car repair shop, pretending that she's nothing but an ordinary citizen. Never mind that her next door neighbor Adam is an alpha male, that's the big werewolf on campus, running a large pack of fluffy, irksome and very volatile werewolves. There is also Stefan, her vampire friend whose care she's fixing, and if anyone reads these kinds of books seriously, then they know that vampires are so much more devious and complex than the cunning and ultra sensitive weres and they can never get along! It isn't long when the two sides start to merge into Mercy's life when a strange boy shows up at her door, smelling like a wolf. He brings trouble with him and pretty soon something happens and Mercedes has no choice but get closer to the wolves and vampires to try and fight a new enemy, trouble is no one knows who the person is and why they are killing werewolves with strange drugs. When trust and loyalty issues come up between friends and pack members things get ugly as no one ever wants to refuse a fight, and fight they do.I can't even scratch the surface of how freaking awesome this book was, so rich and intricate, totally delectable and gut stirring- a definite hit in my opinion. Now all I have to do is read the rest of the series to quench my thirst, I'm very curious future that unfolds in front of Mercedes and her very cool albeit dangerous friends. Briggs makes the life of a wolf almost beautiful, of course I don't know if I'd want to be one but it would be lovely to turn into one and run like a dog into the sunset once in a while.Happy Halloween `08- Kasia S."
"Blue Bloods (Blue Bloods, #1)",0786838922,Melissa de la Cruz,Barnes and Noble,4.2,BANCHEE_READS,"This is a great vampire tale. They are called blue bloods and come into their heritage around the age of 15. These blue bloods are descendants, or in some cases, the same people who came on the Plymouth. The blue bloods are very wealthy and all go to the same school. Several know what they are before receiving their invitation to the Committee but like Schuyler, others have no clue. Life is great, you find out your immortal, nothing can kill you, you are forever perfect, sun doesn't hurt you, but something is hunting and killing blue bloods.
I enjoyed this book, it was good. Not the best vamp book I've ever read, but a page turner. I enjoy Schuyler and Oliver's relationship and Mimi is the perfect rich brat.
I think the reader is lead to believe there is a relationship brewing between Schuyler and Oliver but in the matter of a paragraph it's nothing. Jack is way too hot and cold to Schuyler and doesn't make sense in his intentions. It also seemed in the space of one chapter being 2 pages long, Schuyler has learned the ancient language and the reader is given the impression that she has discovered very strong hidden powers. The book was moving along very nicely and then it just seemed like it was chopped down and rushed to the end.
Also note, you will not find out who the Silver Blood is, this book does leave you hanging with a need to read the next in the series."
"Blue Bloods (Blue Bloods, #1)",0786838922,Melissa de la Cruz,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"In this wonderful book, Schuyler, Bliss, Mimi, and Jack (a name you will come to LOVE), deal with finding out things other then their heritage and school work. On top of learning your becoming a vampire, people are mysteriously dying, dealing with your best friend straying from you, dealing with the school populars, and conceling your crush on a ""boy"" you can't have; the silver bloods are far from destroyed. 

ok, so I have to say that I have 2 addictions now; I LOVE the Twilight series and The Blue Bloods Series. I honestly thought that I would NEVER find a book as good as or even something that would be as simi cool as Twilight, but in the past week, I have found that totally untrue! The Blue Blood series is a thrilling, heart-warming, exciting romance/suspense story. You sympathize, you get frusterated with, and even, I dare say, fall in love with some of the characters. It always kept me guessing and predicting as I read...(and that was NON stop becuase I couldn't put it down). I generally don't like reading books with a three person point of view, but this kept me on edge and explained alot about the characters so you could get to really know (and sorta understand) them. I bought all (so far, can't wait until the fourth comes out....)and haven't regretted it. I LOVE these books! The only thing I would warn you is that you might want to wait until the fourth book to read them, because the 3rd one leaves you hanging! :)

(:  Enjoy, Reading 'em!  :)"

"The Alienist (Dr. Laszlo Kreizler, #1)",0812976142,Caleb Carr,Barnes and Noble,4.3,JGolomb,"Wow. What a read. I don't think I've gone through 600 pages faster than I did with ""Alienst"" over the past week. The story is exciting. The writing is vivid. And the characters are interesting. 

Think of this as CSI - New York - 1896. The story: a turn of the century psychologist, a crime reporter, Theodore Roosevelt, and a few other detectives and support staff search for a serial killer who's horribly butchering children in New York City.

There are virtually no lulls in the story, as author Carr drops clue after clue, and slowly builds up an empirical profile of the mysterious killer. There are no obvious points to put the book down and take a breather, as I continuously found myself staying up later and later following each new lead and discovery.

The book is a bit gory. There's nothing held back in the details of bloody murders, and reflections on stories of abuse. If you're able to accept this level of realism, then I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book."
"The Alienist (Dr. Laszlo Kreizler, #1)",0812976142,Caleb Carr,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Dr_Dean,"I absolutely loved this book!
There is a little bit of everything in this novel--part murder mystery, part psychological thriller, with a generous dose of historical accuracy thrown in.  The reader is thrown into New York City at the turn of the 20th century, where the field of psychology is fighting to emerge into legitimacy.  A rag-tag team is formed to stop a serial killer brutally murdering child prostitutes using rudimentary criminological science.  It's fusion with real characters of the time (Theodore Roosevelt, J.P. Morgan) with an electrifying story made it impossible to put down.  I can't wait to read the sequel!"
"The Alienist (Dr. Laszlo Kreizler, #1)",0812976142,Caleb Carr,Barnes and Noble,4.3,AliceB52,"I am typically a very slow reader, but when I get something really great, I go through it too fast.  This is one of those books.  The characters are compelling, but the plot and setting are so unusual.  The historical details are so interesting.  It is hand over fist one of the most intelligent thrillers I have ever read.  I generally love historical thrillers anyway, but this one is top notch.  If you are a fan of the genre and haven't yet read it then this must go to the top of your list!"
Between the World and Me,0812993543,Ta-Nehisi Coates,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"A great step through one man's conscious encounters with race and oppression throughout his life. It's brutal honesty should make it required reading for all Americans, regardless of race or heritage."

Paradise Lost,0140424393,"John Milton, John      Leonard",Barnes and Noble,4.9,Guest,Paradise Lost and The Canterbury Tales are the most super writings I have ever had the pleasure to read!!! I reccomend them both!!!
Paradise Lost,0140424393,"John Milton, John      Leonard",Barnes and Noble,4.9,vibrantminds on LibraryThing,A 17th century epic of the Genesis account with references to classical mythology throughout.  From the beginning formations of the earth to the design of paradise to the creation of Adam and Eve to the Fall. The idea behind the verse is that paradise is lost but hope still remains through Christ who will save the offspring of our first parents who sinned.  Adam is shown a vision when his hope is diminished that encompasses all of humanity from Noah to Abraham to Joseph of Egypt to David and up through Christ¿s birth and death.  The world is corrupt but there is hope for all in the end.  Very difficult but interesting to read; there are notes to help through all the references to the mythology and other passages that we today are unfamiliar with.
Paradise Lost,0140424393,"John Milton, John      Leonard",Barnes and Noble,4.9,Anagarika-Sean on LibraryThing,"This book was fantastic, but wasn't quite as good as Dante's work. Still, one of my favorites."
The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine,0393072231,Michael   Lewis,Barnes and Noble,4.1,PTrubey,"Hugely entertaining look at the genesis of our current economic mess.  Lewis finds the very few investors who predicted and profited from the sub-prime mortgage meltdown and follows their journey from initial realization of the impending disaster to eventual payout.  Following these eccentric characters and their interactions with the big Wall Street investment banks is at turns laugh out loud funny and head shaking incredulous.  Lewis knows how to turn a phrase and does a good job teasing out the dark humor of the situations.  He also does a very good job at explaining the essence of very complicated financial transactions and gives the reader a good understanding of the whys and hows of the financial meltdown.  While this book is an important addition to our understanding of what happened, it isn't complete as it doesn't spend any time talking about US government policies that contributed to the crash (specifically, the special legal status given to the three rating agencies, and Fannie and Freddie's role in weakening underwriting standards).  Nonetheless, this is still both an important and entertaining book."
The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine,0393072231,Michael   Lewis,Barnes and Noble,4.1,TheReadingWriter,"It seems ridiculous for me to urge you to read this book. Don't read it. You'll sleep better. But please don't go investing on Wall Street if you don't read it. This book took my breath away. I learned things and feel oddly vindicated and cheated at the same time. I knew dumb people were making money with my money: vindicated. I thought some people in the government might be smart enough to realize what happened and know what to do: cheated. Michael Lewis did the plebian job of untangling a very messy ball of knotted threads and on the other hand did a herculean job of elevating the discussion above the rock-slinging and shouting to which some angry losers are wont to resort. His characterizations of those involved on both sides of the trades are intimate enough to involve our emotions as well as our interest, but I think what really charmed me was the absurdity of some phrases that matched so perfectly the absurdities he was describing: 'Inside Morgan Stanley, the subprime lending boom created a who-put-chocolate-in-my-peanut-butter moment.' (p.201) Osama and his team of bombers couldn't have done what our own Wall Street firms and their rating agencies and regulators did to the to the U.S. people and to the credibility of the U.S. government: 'It was as if bombs of differing sizes had been placed in virtually every major financial institution. The fuses had been lit and could not be extinguished. All that remained was to observe the speed of the spark, and the size of the explosions.' (p.225)"
The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine,0393072231,Michael   Lewis,Barnes and Noble,4.1,ELKMA,"Michael Lewis does a terrific job of explaining the esoteric world of sub prime mortgages, collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps and provides a very accessible understanding of the near melt down of the financial system.  The book is also highly entertaining with a cast of characters that will play well in the movie version."
A Monster Calls,1406311529,"Patrick Ness, Jim Kay, Siobhan Dowd",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"I bought this book mainly because I loved Patrick Ness' other books. I was a little surprised after finishing it and realized it had really touched me in a very real way. Mind you, I am in my forties and like young adult novels because they are easy reads. ""Monster"" is an easy read, but so thought provoking and emotional it felt like it was much more. My ten year old daughter is reading it now and thouroughly enjoying it as well. Highly recomended."
A Monster Calls,1406311529,"Patrick Ness, Jim Kay, Siobhan Dowd",Barnes and Noble,4.5,PlumPudding,"Wow.  I don't think any book has made me cry this hard (well, except for his Chaos Walking trilogy, that is).  This book is poignant and beautiful.  And REAL.  Cancer has been in my life, and so this book struck a (really sad and deep) chord with me.  Ness can really work his words, too.  He has become my favorite author, hands down.  This book is a masterpiece."
A Monster Calls,1406311529,"Patrick Ness, Jim Kay, Siobhan Dowd",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Bibliophile_TE,Don't dismiss this book because it is a Teen novel.  It is a powerful story of love and grieving that grabs you and won't let you go.
"Towers of Midnight (Wheel of Time, #13)",0765325942,"Robert Jordan, Brandon Sanderson",Barnes and Noble,4,Alanna87,"The book was fantastic. So many thing WOT fans have been waiting for happened in this book, and every one lived up to my expectations. I really enjoyed reading it. I found Mat to be much more like himself in this book than in the last one, though I admit there were a few moments he was a little off. But even those bits, I still loved. About the ebook - Yes, it was delayed at the request of the author's estate. Harrit, Robert Jordan's wife and editor, explained at a book signing that they delayed it because unfortunately, ebooks sales do not count towards sales in the New York Times Bestsellers list. Every other book in the series has always made it onto the list, which is notonly prestigious but gains the series more readers. So as disappointing as it is, I think that is an acceptable reason to delay it. So yes, please don't complain to B&N, Amazon, Tor/Macmillan, or Brandon Sanderson, because they have nothing to do with it and cannot do anything about it. In fact, originally, the ebook was going to be delayed by a year, but Brandon Sanderson persuaded Harriet to delay the release by only three months. And I agree, please don't give the book a low rating because you're disappointed about the ebook. People look at those ratings to determine if the book is worth a read, and this one definitely is."
"Towers of Midnight (Wheel of Time, #13)",0765325942,"Robert Jordan, Brandon Sanderson",Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,A great addition to the Wheel of Time series.

"Messenger (The Giver, #3)",0385732538,Lois Lowry,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"While reading 'Messenger' by Lois Lowry, I was interested   in the book after the first chapter with its connections to   its previous books, new plot line & setting, and its exciting   start. All of the characters come together into one book,   but this is not noticable right away.  From both 'The Giver'   and 'Gathering Blue', things start to fall into place. While   reading both 'The Giver' and 'Gathering Blue', it was hard   to understand some consepts and some things didn't   make sense. This occured at the beginning of 'Messenger'   as well, but it incorperated all 3 books into one enjoyable   read of adventure and romance. The writing style of this   book has made me even more interested to read it   because it makes you feel like you are there, experiencing   everything on the sidelines, like a director behind the   scenes of a movie. While reading 'Messenger', it was hard   to put the book down. Before I knew it, i could have been   reading for 3 hours straight and be almost finished with   the book. This book is a great read if you like action and   adventure with new twists every few chapters. I really   enjoyed this book because it kept me thinking, and never   really being sure of what would happen next."
"Messenger (The Giver, #3)",0385732538,Lois Lowry,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"I liked this book better than Gathering Blue, but less than The Giver. It was an interesting read and VERY intense!!! Only read this book if your up for a REALLY intense book."

"Lover Revealed (Black Dagger Brotherhood, #4)",0451412354,J.R. Ward,Barnes and Noble,4.5,eReaderSS,"I was frustrated with the constant ups and downs in Butch's and Marissa's relationship.  But I was satisfied the way it turned out for them.  Butch so belongs in the Brotherhood!!!

I also recommend reading ""The Mating"" and ""The Keeping"" (in that order) by a wonderful author named Nicky Charles.  I discovered her by accident and LOVED LOVED LOVED her books.  They are similar to JR Ward's Brotherhood series.  And guess what?  They are both FREE ebooks through the B&N library."
"Lover Revealed (Black Dagger Brotherhood, #4)",0451412354,J.R. Ward,Barnes and Noble,4.5,TheLBD,"i found this to be a REAL SNOOZER!  But i'm optimistic that book #5 will be better because i know how sizzling the author can get, but this one, just didnt do it for me.... i really wouldnt even recommend it to anyone who is reading the series.  I'd just tell them what happens and save them the trouble and time of reading this one."
"Lover Revealed (Black Dagger Brotherhood, #4)",0451412354,J.R. Ward,Barnes and Noble,4.5,BBandReveries,"Lover Revealed is Butch and Marissa's story.  Butch is taken by the lessers very early on in the book after saving a civilian vampire.  He is tortured for information about the brotherhood, but never gives in (Go Butch!).  However, something truly evil is done to Butch before he is left for dead in the middle of nowhere.  After the brotherhood rescues him, they question his fate and allegiance.  Butch is no longer the same ""cop."" After healing from his stay with the lessers, he starts to notice some changes: his body is letting off an odd spice scent around Marissa, he is much more aggressive, he can suck lessers into himself, and his blood turns black whenever he destroys the lessers his way.  
	Marissa and Butch's relationship had so many ""aw"" moments but there was one thing that seriously annoyed me; when Butch called Marissa ""baby,"" I cringed.  I really don't know why that bothered me so much.  Other than that, everything was fine.  Butch wasn't my favorite character, even in the beginning, and this book didn't really change that for me.  Although, there were some aspects that really stood out and made me love Ms. Ward's writing even more.  
	The Black Dagger Brotherhood series is a romance book series (just look at the titles).  The characters in the series have so much depth, not often seen in adult romance novels.  With each book, Ms. Ward astounds me with the way she skillfully balances the passionate love scenes with actual plot.  In Butch's story, just like Zsadist's, the central characters grow and change through the story.  Butch starts out insecure in his place in life.  Later in the book, when Butch is telling Marissa about his past he comments, ""I've always been different from other people, not just in my family but when I was working here on the CPD force, too.  I never fit in.until I met the Brotherhood.I've been living on the fringes all my life.(325).""  As the story progresses, the Butch becomes a part of a family, a part of something he never had.  Marissa also finds herself.  Even though Butch and Marissa fought a lot in this book, I think it was appropriate.  Neither were secure with themselves.  After Havers forced independence on Marissa, she started to follow her ""Rule Number One: Right or wrong, she made the choices in her life.  No one else did (402).""  Of course, Marissa doesn't become independent overnight.  In fact, she moves in with the brotherhood.  Slowly, she begins to become her own person.  Her transition from flowing gowns and corsets to pants and turtle necks was very symbolic of her transformation from a push over, aristocrat to a fully independent woman, free of the cage her brother and the glymera had forced her in all her life.  
	Lover Revealed was definitely a huge step forward in the war between the vampires and the lessers.  What happens to Butch changes everything.  The Black Dagger Brotherhood have a whole new deadly weapon in the war.  As the Scribe Virgin said, ""Now the new era in the war begins (399).""   
While this wasn't the greatest of the Black Dagger Brotherhood books, it definitely is worth the read.  Fair Warning:  like all the BDB books, there are quite a few graphic sex scenes, violence, profanity, and of course blood and gore.  If you haven't picked these books up yet, then I suggest you buy them.yes, buy them.  They are too amazing not to purchase because you will want to reread them over and over again."

"The Mysterious Benedict Society (The Mysterious Benedict Society, #1)",0316057770,"Trenton Lee Stewart, Carson Ellis",Barnes and Noble,4.6,FHResident,I am an 11 year old girl and I found this book was so engaging! I couldn't stop reading it! All the characters were so intersting and the story is very captivating. I loved the puzzles and the mysteries that the characters had to solve. I also loved that all the names of characters and places had secret meanings hidden in them. This was definitely one of the best book I've ever read.
"The Mysterious Benedict Society (The Mysterious Benedict Society, #1)",0316057770,"Trenton Lee Stewart, Carson Ellis",Barnes and Noble,4.6,Dr.Dad,"My son and I really enjoyed reading this book together. It had many great lessons and principles about friendship, teamwork, persistence and loyalty. It really lent itself to deeper discussions about life and values. The plot was captivating and it was easy to see yourself in the action. Consequently it was fun to ask my son what he would have done or done differently than the characters in the story. Even though the children in the book were uniquely gifted, they retained some of the common,ordinariness of all kids and so were easy to identify with. It reminded me of the Harry Potter and Series of Unfortunate Events series without the supernatural or bizarre. Despite the realism, the storyline was exciting as the kids defeat the mad genius villian bent on world domination. It's a great read and you and your kids will love it!"

god is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything,0446579807,Christopher Hitchens,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Wanderluster,"As someone who was raised in a pentecostal Christian household and yet miraculously turned out completely and utterly open-minded and inquisitive, I found this book truly compelling. My current view on religion could best be described as ""agnostic,"" and this book helped to reinforce my beliefs (and non-beliefs). Hitchens presents point after well-crafted point that the thinking individual simply cannot ignore. He tackles the ""big three"" monotheistic religions (and touches on Eastern philosophies as well) with the apt authority of one who really knows his enemy, so to speak. He understands the teachings and stories of the Bible and the Qur'an very well, and deftly and unapologetically points out the many contradictions and sensationalisms therein. If Hitchens' goal was to leave me both enlightened (by his thought-provoking insights) and infuriated (by the dumbfounding machinations of religion), then I can happily say he has achieved a roaring success."
god is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything,0446579807,Christopher Hitchens,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Guest,"Although a Christian, i found this book pretty engaging.  Hitchen makes some valid and interesting points that i've never even bothered to consider.  Overall, while this is a controversial book, i would recommend it to others, as I believe everyone should be open to new ideas and gather insight to the other side of the argument."
god is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything,0446579807,Christopher Hitchens,Barnes and Noble,3.8,john_gault,"If you're a religious person, it gives one pause. If anything it will provide you a different point of view about the basis of your thinking. It's a calm, rational, and well thought out argument for a point of view supporting agnosticism, and atheism. He doesn't push, but the points made need to be considered which challenge your point of view. If you subscribe to a faith, it will give you pause to reflect on how you rationalize your point of view with his. You need to approach the book for what it is; a well presented, rational but different point of view of religion(s), and belief in a ""supreme being"" regardless of which religion you subscribe (actively or not).

Trying to tackle his rational approach with platitudes, and edicts from your religion, is a waste of your money and time. He's not trying to get you to ""convert"" to anything; just a scholarly presentation of a point of view that isn't mainstream, but does reflect faith based actions of individuals, groups, and current religions.
If you're not, it is a different way of thinking, with many rational points of view presented, that are difficult to refute.
Personally, I share his point of view, but was never able to crystalize it as succinctly and with the background research he provides to move this point of view forward.
Religion has always been a practice of mysticism.
It was an enjoyable read."
State of Fear,0061015733,Michael Crichton,Barnes and Noble,3.6,DLBaird,"Due to the extensive biblio and fast-paced story by MC, I found this book myth-busting and thought provoking. A solidly contrasting view to the pulp-fiction, believe-what-you-are-told global warming hysteria.  Don't get me wrong.  I believe that we have a grave responsibility to be good stewards for the planet.  It is, after all, the only one in our solar system that *we* can live on.  But I appreciated the reminder to do my own thinking and ask a question or two or ten."
State of Fear,0061015733,Michael Crichton,Barnes and Noble,3.6,StarryTwang,"Michael Crichton set out to write this book to confirm the popular notions about global warming.  However, when he started doing the research, he was amazed to find that the data convinced him the global warming theory is a hoax.  He then changed the direction of his book."
State of Fear,0061015733,Michael Crichton,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Guest,Do your homework!  Once again Michael Crichton studies an issue and the science behind it and gives an explanation of his research in relatable terms and packs it into an exciting page turner.  A very fair argument to the very controversial issue of global warming. As always with a Crichton novel-a great read!
The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight,0316122386,Jennifer E. Smith,Barnes and Noble,4.4,precious_seraph,"I¿ll start by saying this quote from Sea by Heidi Kling: I wanted to tell him that you can meet someone and they can change your life forever, even if you have only known him for a short while¿

That quote was exactly what was manifested in The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight. But when Hadley met Oliver, she wasn¿t really thinking about that. She was thinking that it was all because of the flight. Midair, people meet people, share stories with them and maybe even share a few secrets with them. But upon landing, they just wave goodbye and walk away forever. Somehow, that was what happened to Hadley and Oliver. They met at the airport, left the airport and went their separate ways. It should¿ve stayed that way for them, like for most people, but in 24 hours time, they managed to develop a connection that was sudden, startling and life-changing.

Hadley went to the airport with annoyance, dread and unwillingness building up inside of her. Her father was going to get married to a British woman she¿s never even met, the same British woman that caused her parents¿ divorce. She was one of the bridesmaids. I love Hadley¿s character. She was honest but considerate and unsure in so many ways but determined. She seemed so real. This girl could be me if I were in that position. For this, it was very easy to like her and to feel for her.

Oliver was an English gentleman. Tall, lanky, handsome with good humor, he was absolutely adorable. Throughout the time he spent with Hadley while waiting for their flight and during the flight, he was pleasing, entertaining and amusing. He was the kind of guy that makes a good impression and that is hard to forget. But I could sense that there was something dark about him, like something was weighing down on his shoulders, occasionally making him hunched, distant and silent.

In London, Hadley went through the motions of preparing for the wedding. She met Charlotte, the British woman who captured her Dad¿s heart. There, she realized the truth about her Dad¿s new phase, the changes in her own life and Oliver. The novel was a grand mixture of musings and flashbacks that brought me closer and closer to Hadley. The flashbacks were vivid and painted with emotion. They were honest and real from the memory of a child. It helped me in connecting the dots and seeing the bigger picture.

The writing was breathtaking. I loved it! I loved how the author transformed that most mundane thing into something beautiful and how she injected little bits of realizations about daily life into the novel. It was like looking at life through a different pair of eyes.

The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight is an extraordinary contemporary romance born from an extraordinary circumstance. The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight is brimming with humor, curiosity, love, changes and regrets that will fly readers to the world of possibility, fresh starts and second chances. I highly recommend this to readers of contemporary romance!"
The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight,0316122386,Jennifer E. Smith,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Nikkayme,"There are some books that are so perfectly perfect that they make the reader swoon along with them. The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight is one of those books. It&rsquo;s romantic and heartfelt and so much more than just that &ndash; focusing on more than just the romance and allowing the reader to see true love in more ways than one.

There&rsquo;s still plenty of romance. And it&rsquo;s magnificently done, invoking butterflies and blushes and longing. Brit boy Oliver is sexy (he&rsquo;s British, so obviously he&rsquo;s sexy) and intelligent and quirky and funny and absolutely adorable in his randomness. He makes Hadley&rsquo;s heart race and will do the same to the reader. Considering that a third of the book takes place in an airport/airplane, these two need to have some serious chemistry to keep the reader hooked.

On top of a romance that feels epic, there&rsquo;s the backstory to both Hadley and Oliver. Hadley&rsquo;s family dynamic is so well-crafted that I was there with her, the entire way, partially hating her father, while hoping the two of them could work everything out. The father/daughter relationship has just the right amount of angst and bitterness, then Smith throws in flashbacks of tenderness and undeniable love.

Hadley is everything readers could want her to be. She&rsquo;s young and angry at her father, angry at her mother, but vulnerable and not jaded enough to have a complete disbelief in love. This book had me smiling from that very first page. Jennifer E. Smith knows how to write characters that the reader will feel an instant attachment to, and give us a story that is impossible to put down.

The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight will sway even the most reluctant romantics with its delightful humor, heartfelt characters, and the idea that maybe love at first sight is possible. Smith&rsquo;s collection of fate, coincidence, and love made me smile, it made me laugh, and it even made me tear up &ndash; it&rsquo;s that good. As far as contemporary YA goes, The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight is one of the best and a definite must read."

"The Golem's Eye (Bartimaeus, #2)",0786836547,Jonathan Stroud,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"This is the second in the series and I must say that I loved it even more than the original. I like how you got to know more about Kitty and Nathaniel. No wonder Jonathan Stroud said I think in an interview or something that he had fun writing it. It was fun to read and I couldn't help but read the next chapter not realizing what the time was afterwards. That's how good it is. It has action, adventure, suspense, and little romance. Nat sort of still gets on my nerves at times but still love Bartimaeus. Read it after you've read the first of course. There are three stories concerning Kitty (I liked hers better than Nat's to be honest), Nat and Bartimaeus (anything with him in it is awesome either way). Check this series out when you get a chance. Jonathan Stroud is now one of my fave writers."
"The Golem's Eye (Bartimaeus, #2)",0786836547,Jonathan Stroud,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"This is yet another brilliant story written by Jonathan Stroud. Once again, he uses just the right amount of wittiness, adventure, and suspense inorder to create an amazing, complex tale. The author weaves a truly wonderful story by providing background information on the golems, and then building off of that provided background so that everything is tied up with each other, leaving no loose ends and creating a truly statisfying book."
"The Golem's Eye (Bartimaeus, #2)",0786836547,Jonathan Stroud,Barnes and Noble,4.4,carlosmock,"The Golems's Eye by Jonathan Stroud- Book Two of the Bartimaeus Trilogy

The second book starts where the first one ended.  Nathaniel-now officially John Mandrake-after the demise of his incompetent master is now assigned to be the apprentice of the powerful Security Minister, Ms. Jessica Whitwell, and is promoted to be the youngest Assistant to the Head of Internals affairs, Mr., Julius Tallow, who inherited his old master's job.  

At only 14, Nathaniel is a rising star: a young magician who is rapidly climbing the ranks of the government.  He's a bright future until he is asked to deal with the growing Resistant movement, which is disrupting magicians' lives with thefts and raids.

No easy task, The ringleaders: Katherine Jones (Kitty), Frederick Weaver (Fred), and Stanly Hake (Stan), have a special talent: they are resilient to magic and under the guidance of Mr. T. E Pennyfeather, they are about to commit their greatest theft of all: rob the tomb pf the greatest magician who ever lived: Mr. Gladstone.

As the pressure mounts, a new series of terrifying attacks are occurring in London.  First attributed to the resistant, Nathaniel has no choice but to break his promise to Bartimaeus, the djinni who helped save the government in the first book.  Bartimaeus discovers that the new destruction is being caused by a Golem-not seen since 1868 in the war with Prague.  Nathaniel must make a desperate journey to the enemy city of Prague and uncover who's the traitor behind the summation of the Golem and at the same time deal with the Resistance.

A thrilling sequel to the Amulet of Samarkan, The Golem's eye is a roller coaster ride of magic, adventure, and political skullduggery in which lessons and change of attitudes occur as the fates of Kitty, Bartimaeus, and Nathaniel explosively collide.

This is a wonderful read, definitively highly recommended!!!"
Still Life with Woodpecker,184243022X,Tom Robbins,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Modern_Day_Philosopher,"""Sharks are the criminals of the sea. Dolphins are the outlaws."" Most people view outlaws as outlandish and destructive people, but only few have been able to phonetically explain what depth and ""laws"" an outlaw must live by. In the story Still Life with a Woodpecker written by Tom Robbins, he is remarkable in his ability to make such deep ideas come out at a humorous level and yet still be thought of in a serious way. The story involves two abstract and opposite people who meet, love, and hate each other in a mere 3 pages. The characters, romance, and morals to this novel make it a classic.
The main character is a woman named Leigh-Cheri, but she is no ordinary actually she is a princess living hidden in the United States. She strictly believes in peace amongst everything, and just wants no one to feel any harm. She lived in solitude for a while due to her miscarriage as a cheerleader at a football game, and in her embarrassment dropped out of school. Now the second character is known as the Woodpecker. He loves dynamite and feels that everything can be fixed if dynamite is used correctly. He lives outside the law, and feels that it is his duty to go against the government for government to exist. He is a very intellectual individual and strange man. He is quoted saying, ""The lung of the smoker is a naked virgin thrown as a sacrifice into the god fire"", which just shows his abstract views on things.
I have never really been a fan of romance novels, but the romance in this is very different and deeper than most love we see in movies and shows. The Woodpecker and Princess meet at a peace fest in Hawaii under strange circumstances. He was trying to blow up part of the fest, but placed the dynamite in the wrong location. After she places him under citizen's arrest he woos her without even trying. It is very humorous how they both have very strong beliefs in different things and yet love overcame them.
Although most themes within the story were underlying ones they were still apparent in the novel. For example, ""Funny how we think of romance as always involving two, when the romance of solitude can be ever so much more delicious and intense"" this was said by the Woodpecker when he had lost someone he loved. It really shows that a person can live without a partner as long as they love themselves. Also he talks about how outlaws are actually a necessity to society, but somehow not part of society. This really shows how our world is today if you think about it.
In Conclusion, Still Life with a Woodpecker is a great read for anyone who loves an easy read with a deep story and an occasional laugh. I would highly recommend it."
Still Life with Woodpecker,184243022X,Tom Robbins,Barnes and Noble,4.3,judianne727,"I love this book. So far I have purchased atleast 3 copies and borrowed it twice (somehow mine keep disappearing.) It took me all of two days to read it, for the simple fact that I simply couldn't put it down. I adore Tom Robbins, and have also read Even Cowgirls, Another Roadside Attraction, and Fierce Invailds Home from Hot Climates; and I can honestly say that of them all, this book is my favorite and will always remain close to my heart."
Still Life with Woodpecker,184243022X,Tom Robbins,Barnes and Noble,4.3,alivalentine,"Engaging in 'Still Life' should cure such ailments, if only temporarily (which is far better than Never, mind you). As an avid Robbins fan, I can confidentally say that 'Still Life' is my favorite book of his- if not my favorite book that I've ever had the pleasure of reading. The quirky, witty writing style, in a bit of a stream-of-consciousness form (yet not overly so), hooked me immediately, and the unique nature of the book, characters, and love story is brilliant. A truly remarkable read."
Those Who Save Us,0156031663,Jenna Blum,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"This is an amazing story.  I was drawn in and couldn't put it down to the very end.  It flips back and forth from the present to the past with the mother's life, and with her daughter's life.  Each time it switched, I didn't want to leave one's life for the next, but was quickly drawn to the 'new' story.  This book made me think of 'Stones from the River' by Ursula Hegi which was also told from the German's point of view."
Those Who Save Us,0156031663,Jenna Blum,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"First of all, this book tells a fascinating story.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.

The reader should be warned that the editing in this book was horrible.  First, there are no quotation marks, making the dialogue confusing at times.  Many sentences don't begin with a capital letter, the word ""I"" is sometimes written with a lower case letter, spelling errors are frequent, and one of the protagonist's name even is misspelled in some chapters."
Those Who Save Us,0156031663,Jenna Blum,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"I just started reading this novel and so far the story is really interesting, however there is one thing missing - quotation marks!!!

I'm surprised no one has yet to mention it, but I have to say it is really distracting to have to read dialogue without quotation marks to differentiate between what is said and what is thought. 

I know the new trend for new authors is to forego conventional writing styles for a more free-form approach, but it loses it's effect here - I find myself distracted by the lack of quotation marks (I want to fill them in by hand!) instead of focusing on what promises to be a great story. 

Editors at Harcourt: please put them back in for the next edition! My 8th grade English teacher would have a heart attack if she read this novel!"
The Broker,0385340540,John Grisham,Barnes and Noble,3.4,Guest,"While I still call myself a Grisham fan - especially with the goofy cartoon characters that appear in his prose - this book didn't work for me for two reasons:  1- Too much time and energy is spent on the Italy experience. It came across as an Italian travel commercial.  2- Like 'The Brethren', since there was no real protagonist to root for, by the end I didn't care a flying fig how the story came out. I didn't feel the slightest bit of empathy for Joel. Teddy was a sadistic piece of work. Luigi was too cardboard to be of any help. The one engaging relationship - the love interest - was drawn far too subtly for my liking. C'mon - the guy was in prison for six years... would you want to look at porticos for two hundred pages?  Extremely disappointing. Terribly."
The Broker,0385340540,John Grisham,Barnes and Noble,3.4,Anonymous,"I read this book and loved it! I felt that Grisham really grabbed my attention right from the beginning on this one. From the late night pardon all the way to the trip back to Italy to find the lady who saved Joel's life, it was unescapable!! I bought the audio to listen to while at work and I listen to it over and over. This book is worth the read!"

"Across the Universe (Across the Universe, #1)",1595143971,Beth Revis,Barnes and Noble,4.1,NatalieTahoe,"WOW! I think this word over and over again throughout the reading of Across the Universe, by Beth Revis. A Young Adult novel, it is literally a murder mystery in space, in a universe that stretches on and on, infinite and vast. And how incredibly lonely it is when stuck on a ship traveling in it. Amy is sixteen and lives with her parents on Earth. Her parents are gifted and essential to a world that other gifted members of society are selected to make a journey to. These people will be cryogenically frozen to journey 300 years to this new world to help begin life on that planet. But, Amy is not essential to this new planet. She's a kid, but is permitted to go because of her parents, and is frozen into the 300 year sleep along with her parents on the ship called Godspeed. Fifty years before the intended arrival to this new world, Amy awakes when she is unplugged and separated from her cryo-haven, surviving an attempted murder -- and no one knows who did it. Forced with the reality that she is now living in a small city that exists on the metal ship, where everyone awakens to a fake sun and drinks recycled water, Amy bonds with Elder, also sixteen. This new life is all that she will now have and she is also awake before her parents. She's now alone. Elder is next in line to lead the ship after the current aging leader, known as Eldest, passes on. But, now amidst the safety of a world which doesn't know questions and chaos, someone is starting to kill again, and they're targeting the frozen people hidden in a ship that only a few select people know about. The release date for this book is January 2011, and color me giddy with excitement for how this book will be received by everyone. It has all of the elements that all murder mysteries need, which completely satiated my desire for a good ""whodunit,"" all amidst the realities of space and the cage of Godspeed. I could not put the book down, and my eyes were growing heavy with sleep late into the night as I kept telling myself ""just one more page."" Each chapter switches between Amy's and Elder's perspective, allowing you to experience each of their own stories. Normally, I tend to like one character more than another when chapters switch like that and want to hurry to get to the next chapter, but not with this one. As each chapter switched characters, I was excited, ready to find out more and uncover the mystery that each of them were facing. I cannot tell you more about the plot without giving anything away - I can only tell you that I loved this book, this story with characters so real and interesting and engaging. I was drawn into their angst, their confusions, and the mystery that they were trying to solve. There is even more to this story, discussions of class systems, prejudice, and other social issues that were fascinating. I admit that I sit on the edge of my seat wishing for 2011 to pass quickly so that I can get my hands all over Book Two -- oh, yes, this is a series! Yes, yes, yes!"
"Across the Universe (Across the Universe, #1)",1595143971,Beth Revis,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Mosstralia,"Reading Across the Universe is like watching a bad carwreck, you know it's sad but you just can't look away. Among the spaceship's  1,000 + inhabitants are 100 people who have been cryogenically frozen - specialists in the fields of science and military and their family members from earth who will help to start the new planet once they land. But there are problems. Lots of them. Someone has been trying to kill off select frozen people by unplugging their power source and thus making them drown to death, through centuries of breeding incest is rampant on the spaceship and everyone looks the same, the spaceship is being ruled by a Hitler-like dictator who lies and drugs the passengers in order to keep them obedient, history books about earth have been changed to show Kim Jong IL and Hitler as heroes and peacemakers as evil and the one unfrozen victim who was rescued is the only one who can see all the problems and knows the truth but no one believes her. The book was great in a depressing way. I kept wanting to read and find out what else was a lie about the spaceship, some of the secrets were easy to figure out, others were complete shockers. The last chapter ended on a positive note, however this is a series so look forward to the next depressing 79 chapters soon!"
"Across the Universe (Across the Universe, #1)",1595143971,Beth Revis,Barnes and Noble,4.1,ChelseaW,"As Amy's father prepares to be cryogenically frozen, he offers her a chance to opt-out and continue living her life as normal on Earth. She chooses to be frozen herself, and follow her parents aboard the Godspeed, to be woken up 300 years in the future on another planet. When she is thawed out, it is extremely painful and 50 years too soon. She quickly makes a friend in Elder, a boy roughly the same age as she is and second in command on the ship. But Amy is from Earth, and her different appearance and behavior does not fit into society on the ship at all. Before long, sinister acts begin happening around Amy, turning allies into suspects. With lies being revealed and secrets being overturned, Amy and Elder hold on whatever truths they hold in themselves.

Across the Universe is breathtaking science fiction, the kind where I feverishly turn the pages to find out what happens next. One of those books where immediately after the last page is turned, I want to start over from the beginning and read it again. It really is that good. I was hooked right from the start, with the detailed process of being frozen. I am usually pretty squeamish but I could not stop reading. I felt every inch of Amy's claustrophobia and every ounce of Elder's frustration. The futuristic swearing is reminiscent of Battlestar Galactica and works well with Elder's character. Revis goes to great lengths in order to let the reader discover what is what in the world she has created. There are no lengthy passages of exposition. Some aspects are very cool (grav tubes) and others are a little far-fretched (mono ethnicity), but overall the concepts are deeply thought out and well executed. Fans of Maria V. Snyder's Inside Out and Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games will love this book. I eagerly look forward to more from this author!"

Dresden is one of the more interesting characters ever devised in this genre (Gandalf meets Sam Spade with a huge dose of wise-ass) and James Marsters was the perfect choice as a reader for the series (as good, for example, as Patrick Tull was for the Patrick O'Brien Aubrey-Maturin novels).  Although I've enjoyed all of the Dresden Files books immensely, this episode is among my favorite.  Why?  Well, it brings us Mouse, explains the Thomas-Harry relationship, gives us a glimpse into the Murphy family, and reveals what a cold monster Papa Wraith really is."
"Blood Rites (The Dresden Files, #6)",0451459873,Jim Butcher,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Pheonix on LibraryThing,"So there hasn't been a book thus far in the series that I haven't loved. I have definitely liked some more than others, and this book is one of them. It was fantastic from the first page that started off with Harry on the run in the middle of a case. To the last pages where the bonds of family and friends were tested and exposed.This book has been one of the more emotional ones. I found that there were a lot of personal moments with Murphy, Harry, Ebenezer, Thomas with Justine and his House Raith vampire family. It was nice to hear the history between some of the characters and see them tested.I am eager to start book seven of the series as the stories just keep getting better and more intertwined and with them, the characters more developed.I rate this book 5/5.Priscilla"

How to Be a Woman,0091940737,Caitlin Moran,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Anonymous,"This is a terrific, provocative and thought provoking book on feminisim and all things, ""woman,"" in general; however, it is not for everyone's tastes.

***If you are easily offended by four letter words on a broad, or body-specific basis--you'll probably want to stay away. Moran is an intelligent, articulate writer, but she gleefully embraces her vulgarities, even defending her use of one particularly offensive word.  While the language can be blunt, it simply comes across as being HER, her personality and her view of womanhood;  for me, it did not come across as a blatant attempt to be shocking--it's just who she is, her experience. I found it alternately appropriate, funny and question-raising; I had no problem with it--but some readers might.

***As Moran is English, based in London and the book was originally published there--there are many references to British personalities, pop culture and every day life that some readers will not be familiar with.  If it's bothersome, be prepared to do some Googling.

***A feminist-treatise, this is also a memoir;  Moran is ""no holds barred"" on her personal revelations. At times, this reads as ""TMI"" with raw, humiliating, cringe-worthy recounts of her coming of age: as one of 8 kids she relates, with brutal honesty, the traumas of being welfare-poor to the point her hand-me-downs included her mother's old underpants and the stifling lack of privacy. 

***Her sister, Caz, emerges as a prize scene-stealing supporting character--some of the best lines are from her 

***Moran is a wickedly funny, highly intelligent writer and thinker; don't assume because this book is funny, it's not serious.  It tackles everything from body image/hair/functions, to sex, marriage, kids and abortion. It is a perfect read for discussion with your closest friends as Moran talks about these subjects in intimate ways that many of us wish we could emmulate.

I find her views refreshing and bold--and comforting: it reminds us that being a woman--struggling to come into our womanhood--is traumatic, often gross, humilating and heartbreaking.  Yet Moran reminds us we are not alone in our ""female"" struggles and ultimately, to find joy, in who and what we are.  

Not for everyone's taste, but for those who jump in--I think you will enjoy the ride--this is a worthwhile read that absolutely needs to be discussed, laughed over, and debated."
How to Be a Woman,0091940737,Caitlin Moran,Barnes and Noble,3.7,SC_Paula,"Caitlin Moran's How To Be a Woman is wildly funny and at the same time a great introduction to a modern idea of what it means to be a feminist.  To quote the author, ""a.  Do you have a vagina? and b. Do you want to be in charge of it?  If you said ""yes"" to both, then congratulations!  You're a feminist.""  Moran tackles everything from menstruation to masturbation, hair removal, underwear size, and abortion in a very honest and hilarious fashion.  As a side note, I learned about this book when Caitlin and Jenny Lawson aka The Blogess (who is also ridiculously funny and the author of Let's Pretend This Never Happened) interviewed each other."
How to Be a Woman,0091940737,Caitlin Moran,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Anonymous,"This book is an unapologetic feminist rant, wrapped in an entertaining autobiography.  It treats some very important issues with thought-provoking comments, but also is peppered with a good deal of humor.  There are some really important take-away messages that nicely summarize the situation for women and our place in society.  I really liked how she suggested that asking simple questions could help assess important problems like harassment and oppression/inequality:  ""is that polite?"" and ""are the men doing this?""

There is a lot of strong language that may be off-putting to some readers, and as the author is from the U.K. there is some usage that may be unfamiliar to US readers.  In addition, there is quite a bit of slang that may be unfamiliar to readers who are not as steeped in popular culture, but it does not interfere with the reading of the book (and can be entertaining to look up).  This is the sort of book that our daughters should read and consider, but it might be better (depending on the daughter's age) if we didn't know they were reading it!"
Life,0297854399,Keith Richards,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Circulartime,"As a long time Stones fan, I've seen them live in 4 different decades, 2 centuries and 2 milleniums, my biggest surprise was how accurate the unauthorised biographies are.  Staight from Keiths mouth cleared up only a few minor details in his life story.  Regardless though, I found the book very enjoyable.  I would find myself alternating between rooting for Keith and then thinking he needs to grow up.  I guess becoming an international pop star by the time he was 23 and then maintaining that status his entire adult life would tend to create a very different perspective on life.  The absolute best parts of the book for Keith fans are the glimpses into his private life with his family.  His brief account of owning and driving a Winnebago on a couple of family vacations was a bit of a shocker.  I think thats in Revelations somewhere..."
Life,0297854399,Keith Richards,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Mik3MF,"""Keef"" is a fascinating guy. Seems truthful and is insightful. Reads like a conversation with an interesting and disarming person. Not being a musician, the musings about his guitar playing and the music itself was not of interest to me, but I'll bet anyone who plays guitar will get it. I loved the book. Insights into his life and world were fun to read, but I cannot imagine living it. The biggest thing I found was that beneath all that ""image"" thing is a rather sensitive and intelligent person, despite the fact that he was so self destructive. Worth reading."
Life,0297854399,Keith Richards,Barnes and Noble,3.9,NookiewookieRS,"I have always been a mere casual fan of the Stones, but intrigued by Keith's persona.  Keith's character, rather than his music is what interested me in buying this book. This is a great read from cover to cover. I couldn't put it down.  You don't need to be a huge Stones fan to enjoy this rockin' thrill ride.  Keith's approach to life and the people around him provides a glimpse into a warmer, deeper side to the man behind the most famous rock mega-group ever. Oh, and he answers the question about whether he really snorted his father's ashes and what he was doing up in the tree on that tropical beach when he fell and injured himself. This is a great read. Buy the book!"
Unaccustomed Earth,0676979343,Jhumpa Lahiri,Barnes and Noble,4.2,dke,Jhumpa Lahiri has a beautiful way of drawing the reader into her characters and their stories.  I actually believed that I was reading a collection of short stories until I was half way through the book when it dawned on me that I was reading a novel.  Ms. Lahiri has a marvelous gift for surprise that keeps the reader in a  perpetual state of wanting to learn more about her characters and their lives.  Each story holds it's own on an individual basis and yet when taken collectively they make a a breathtaking collage.  I would invite anyone to appreciates the written word to pick up a copy of her book  and indulge themselves.
Unaccustomed Earth,0676979343,Jhumpa Lahiri,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"Call me a fan of Jhumpa Lahiri's beautiful writing.  I loved her first Pulitzer prize winning book of short stories and last winter when I was reading her novel, The Namesake, I heard that this book was even better than the Pulitzer prize winning short story collection, The Interpreter of Maladies.  It proved to be the truth.  I loved this short story collection at least as much as the first, if not more.  Reading these stories transported me to familiar, yet slightly foreign, culture where I lived for the duration of my reading experience.  Ending the last story was like finishing a sad but hopeful novel because a series of interrelated stories concluded the book. 

From my perspective, you can't go wrong with this author.  I love her writing and look forward to whatever she publishes next.  Her stories are a piece of 21st century America infused with strong cultural perspectives.  Her characters are universal yet highly culturally bound...a delight to experience."
Unaccustomed Earth,0676979343,Jhumpa Lahiri,Barnes and Noble,4.2,ajunatnyc,"I've read all three of her books - I think this might be her best.  I loved The Namesake, but she tries new techniques as a writer here.  And she has the power to hit you with once sentence that just kills you in the middle of a story.The third story - Only Goodness - really hit home for me.  I'm glad the Indian community has a voice like this.  And if you're not Indian, I think you might enjoy her books even more because she sheds light on a new world of Indian-American fusion.  Great great book.  I devoured it in a weekend - I think you'll do the same!"

White Noise,0140283307,Don DeLillo,Barnes and Noble,3.7,AnaMardoll,"White Noise / 978-1-440-67447-1 White Noise, arguably Delillo's best work, carefully explores a world where consumerism has, almost literally, consumed us all, to the point where we become empty shells of people. The extended family in the book have been reduced by consumerism to two-dimensional beings, dependent upon television and other cultural stimuli to tell them how to think and behave. Occasionally, they act out against this emptiness (or is it that a wire has been crossed in the brain?) with idiosyncrasies such as a pronounced preference for the smell of burnt toast, or a tendency to find frumpy jogging outfits attractive. On the weekends, they shop at the local supermarket, under the soporific thrall of the overhead neon lights. When their consumer culture literally threatens to kill them, via a toxic waste spill on the town railroad, they are ill-prepared to respond and look to their customary authorities (television and radio) on how to react to the emergency. When fire trucks storm through town, broadcasting an evacuation notice, the mother wonders absently whether the evacuation is a suggestion or a command. And in the aftermath of the toxic cloud, even when many have died and many more have had their lives shortened by exposure to the poison, the town feels no outrage, only numbness that what is normally confined to the television news stories nevertheless happened in their idyllic town. Actors themselves, they practice emergency evacuations, determined to perform better ""next time"". Despite the shallowness of their lives, they fear death. Some self-medicate with dangerous experimental drugs in an attempt to control that fear. Others take up death-defying hobbies in the hope that this will deaden their fear. They discuss which food preservatives will kill them, whether the phones lines will cause cancer, which yoga poses will prolong their lives, and how to squeeze every drop of life out of their lives. When a character points out how much energy is wasted in daily life (carrying things that don't need to be carried, making extra trips, etc.), another asks what would one do with all the saved energy. The answer: Live longer. In this way, Delillo paints a stunning and frightening portrait of a community that fears death yet has no love for life. ~ Ana Mardoll"
White Noise,0140283307,Don DeLillo,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Anonymous,"White Noise is a fantastic work of literature. Chances are you will have a different view of society after reading this. In the novel Don DeLillo examines a society where people are emotionless, completely void of any human feelings. People have been effected by consumerism to extremes.  Characters spend copious amounts of time discussing what will kill them, fearing death, trying their hardest to avoid it, yet have no appreciation for life. When a &ldquo;Airborne Toxic Event&rdquo; kills many of the citizens of the town and decreases the lives of countless others, the townspeople feel no anger whatsoever. They continue their average lives in a almost emotionally sedated state. This book does a fantastic job illustrating how on a grand scale how minor our everyday tasks are. And how we pay more attention to a minor event in our life like going to the grocery store, than a life changing one in another persons life, even someone as close as a child or close friend. Although there are many people who dislike this book, I would recommend it to anyone. It shows a interesting perspective of everyday life. Although we are not in a society centered around consumerism as shown in this novel, some of the characteristics could be applied to us, and might even change your views about certain everyday things.

White Noise,0140283307,Don DeLillo,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Anonymous,"I'll admit, it took me about 30 pages before I realized what I was reading and how good this book really is. It is indeed slow, and at times, you will find yourself re-reading paragraphs. But it is worth it. Don't read this book on a plane or on the train to work. Give it a peaceful setting and attack it with an open mind."

However, I cannot recommend the Nook version, which I would have to give 1 star.  This is actually my first Nook book and I must say I am incredibly disappointed.  Not only is the photographic material removed, the book formatting is absolutely atrocious.  Fonts change size and type 2 or 3 times on a single page making the experience of reading the book a chore.

Not sure if other Nook books are like this, but I don't think there's an excuse for this.  Perhaps it's because I'm using the Nook app on the iPad, but even that is the latest version.

Skip the Nook version and choose the hardback or paperback!"

Blankets,1891830430,Craig Thompson,Barnes and Noble,4.4,zonde,"In this graphic novel Craig Thompson has managed to make some of the most relateable characters I have ever read. Mostly the story of a first love from beginning flirtations to a bitter end, the story also takes you through the progression of mind and memory and how we become who we are. While reading there are a range of emotions that you go through and in the end you close the book and think about your own progression and growth. From the moment I picked the book up I did not want to put it down. The pictures and text work fantastically together. I stayed up all night to finish it. I recommend it to anyone who has ever questioned life, religion, love,or themselves and other; or anyone simply looking for an amazing work of art to read and revisit over and over."
Blankets,1891830430,Craig Thompson,Barnes and Noble,4.4,sliprockdoc,"This book is amazing: ""footnotes"" section should be read many times to appreciate his message.

Blankets,1891830430,Craig Thompson,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"I thought that Blankets was ok, probably because I'm a little young. I also read it in one day, becuase it was so hard to put down. It was a little graphic, but beyond that, the story is beautiful and Craig and Phil as children are so innocent. It makes you think, and makes you find the meanings behind each picture. I got into graphic novels when I read this book."
The Story of Edgar Sawtelle,0061374229,David Wroblewski,Barnes and Noble,3.6,adambomb314,"Please do not read this book. I just finished it and have never felt more betrayed and letdown by a book before. If you would have asked me yesterday what I thought of the book, I would have told you I loved it. The characters were engrossing, the language was at once a combination of being sparse and detailed. There was just the right amounts of mystery and beauty, and a touch of the otherworldly. In fact, I felt that anything was possible and plausible in the world of the book. I just don't see the point  after finishing it. Why did I go through all of Edgar's struggles only to be stabbed in the back by the author. To me, a story should have a reason, a lesson, a moral objective. But where was it? If it was in there it was overshadowed by the ending, which is all I can think about now. Ripping the readers guts out over the course of a book is good, if there is some kind of satisfaction in the outcome of the story. I think the books objective could have been achieved with a different ending, while still being true to the story. I don't even need a full on happy ending, thats not my point. My point is that misery for misery's sake is just pointless. I lived in Wisconsin, and I love dogs, so maybe I fell a little too hard for this book."
The Story of Edgar Sawtelle,0061374229,David Wroblewski,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Anonymous,"You have to have an open mind when reading this book or you definitely won't ""get it.""  If you like everything tied up in a neat little package and don't like difficult words (you might even have to look some up), this is probably not the book for you.  But if you enjoy feeling like you're living right there with the characters and seeing right through their eyes, this author can take you there.  I especially liked seeing the world through Almondine's eyes.  It made me understand how my own dogs probably see the world.  A terrible sadness gripped me right in the pit of my stomach at the end, but I also felt joy that Almondine's spirit was there for Edgar and I was glad Claude suffered too.  I think the ending is open to interpretation, which is good because it gets people talking about the book.  I felt somehow that Forte would join the dogs and become their leader, perhaps even take them to Henry.  I felt like the dogs were able to almost communicate telepathically with each other.   Towards the end of the book I felt excitement and fear and dread for Edgar, disgust and loathing for Claude and pity for Trudy - and I just couldn't put the book down.  I actually went back and read the last three chapters one more time after I had finished. I can't wait for him to write another book!"
The Story of Edgar Sawtelle,0061374229,David Wroblewski,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Anonymous,I'll keep it short and sweet.  It was a wonderful book until the end.  I hated the ending so much that it ruined the whole book and made me wonder what the whole thing was about.
Drowning Ruth,0345439104,Christina Schwarz,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,I thouroughly enjoyed this book and found the characters to be interesting and I wanted to know more.  The story is written in both first and third person and from different character perspectives.  Their are many mysteries woven through this book and it has a rewarding ending although I would have liked to find a little more about the title character's future.  When all the secrets are finally revealed you will be surprised by the outcome.  I recommend this book for anyone wanting more that the regular chick lit that is out there.
Drowning Ruth,0345439104,Christina Schwarz,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"So many flashbacks, flashforwards and sidetrips that this novel left me with hotflashes! A potentially strong novel of family ties and secrets is marred by the fitful starts and stops of the story line."

Post Office,0876850867,Charles Bukowski,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"While it is very much the norm in modern literature to focus on the self as the central theme of the writer's work, the novelist choses this motif at his own peril. Bukowski's grasp somewhat outstrips his reach  this is because his talent to describe a reality is so much more powerful than the material that he chooses to create that reality. Very few writers since Hemingway can set the scene and paint the stage with such remarkable economy of the written word. I see the main difference between a great writer and a good one (and Bukowski is a very good one)is the scope and breadth his material. But Hemingway's world was much larger while Bukowski binds himself too closely in his nutshell. He takes us into strange fields filled with enchanting flowers, only to describe, in breathtaking detail, a blade of grass. Bukowski's fearless approach to truth as a writer comes from (what one can only assume) is his relative poverty as a human being...however well he reveals to us in this novel the transcendental beauty of his blade of grass, we long to be able devour the scents and absorb the sunlight which we can only sense is just outside the writer's realm of experience.

"All the Pretty Horses (The Border Trilogy, #1)",0679744398,Cormac McCarthy,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,This book will reshape your soul.  I don't think it's   posssible to find another author who can capture the most   isolated moment a human soul can bear and give it beauty   in a way that releases you.  This passage alone is worth   the price of the book  -    'He slept that night in a field far from any town.  He built   no fire.  He lay listening to the horse crop the grass at his   stakerope and he listened to the wind in the emptiness   and watched stars trace the arc of the hemisphere and die   in the darkness at the edge of the world and as he lay   there the agony in his heart was like a stake.  He imagined   the pain of the world to be like some formless parasitic   being seeking out the warmth of human souls wherein to   incubate and he thought he knew what made one liable to   its visitations.  What he had not known was that it was   mindless and so had no way to know the limits of those   souls and what he feared was that there might be no   limits.'
"All the Pretty Horses (The Border Trilogy, #1)",0679744398,Cormac McCarthy,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"This novel is a pretty good plot, but the lack of punctuation and slowly progressing story make it difficult to get through at times. The themes and charactization of the book rely on the main charater, John Grady Cole, adventuring into the dying wild west to live out his dream of living off the land in a life full of horses after growing up in the modernizing of Texas. Throughout the novel the image Cole once had of being a cowboy is wreaked when he faces the reality of social constraits and difficulties presented in the time. Additionally, the book as some comic relief, but at times can be rather violent and saddening."
"All the Pretty Horses (The Border Trilogy, #1)",0679744398,Cormac McCarthy,Barnes and Noble,3.9,kyuen1,"Cormac McCarthy has a singular talent: he can write in a lean, minimalist prose that, at the same time, is devastating in its beauty and emotion. Reading this novel was like being under a hypnotic trance, where the characters inhabit a world that is real and merciless but also surreal and haunting. The dialogue blends seamlessly with the thoughts of the characters and with the painting of the landscape, so that they all portray a living, breathing entity. Some readers might be put off by the slow burning, almost cold approach to the writing; but the end result is an achievement, stunning in its poetic imagery."

Roronoa Zoro sounds much better than Roronoa Zolo, dont'cha think? Yes, anyway. I love the hilarity of One Piece and its originality. The most sad backstory of the characters would have to be Chopper. Poor fella. Oda is amazing! I'm surprised more people haven't heard of this spectacular series yet.

"The Last Unicorn (The Last Unicorn, #1)",0451450523,Peter S. Beagle,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"This wonderful book will capture not only the younger generation but adults as well.  It is far from just a story for little girls who love unicorns--although I was one such girl when I first read it.  Reading it again as an adult, I still felt the same sense of wonder and awe. Beautifully written and also touched with some wry humor, The Last Unicorn is one of those books that you just don't forget."

I grew up with the movie and I strongly believe! Yes, everyone is entitled to their own opion but mine is quite clear. You should read it. And if you don't like to read , rent it. Don't let this pass you by.It's like a door that opens a whole new world of magic. Wizards, Bandits, kings, unicorns, secerct doors. It's wonderful it really is."

"Magyk (Septimus Heap, #1)",0060577312,Angie Sage,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Bookreviewer74,"This was just one of those books that I could not put down! The story was very complex. I loved all the spells, characters and the story! I think readers will love to read about Jenna, Boy 412, Nicko and all the other fabulous characters in this book as they go on wonderful adventures in the land of Magyk!"
"Magyk (Septimus Heap, #1)",0060577312,Angie Sage,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Padfoot1998,"Looking for a fresh, new, fantasy? Then the Septimus Heap series is the series for you. I know that most people are fantasy lovers, and it's hard to find another series to read, other than Harry Potter. I myself couldn't stop reading Harry Potter, even after I'd read the entire series dozens of times. Finally, I made myself look for new books to try, and my hand happened to brush the spine of this wonderful book. I opened it's pages, and practically got sucked into it. I visited this awesome world of Septimus Heap, laughing at his joys, and despairing at his losses. I never got bored or tired of this book, and kept on reading it to the end. After reading through this series, I looked for more and more books, exporing through the world of possibilities. This book showed me that there are other great books out there, though I had thought not. I really would recommend this inspiring book to readers of all ages, so they can experience the magical world of this young boy. Go ahead; try something new."
"Magyk (Septimus Heap, #1)",0060577312,Angie Sage,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Barbubblie,"I coordinate a reading program at a school and am a parent of a pre-teen. I bought this book for my son and ended up enjoying it so much that I added it, and the subsequent books in the series, to my personal book library. 

Septimus Heap is from a large and poor magical family. He is the seventh son of a seventh son, which makes him desirable to both good and evil. 

This entertaining story of how this young man develops into a hero is a must read."
Fever 1793,0689848919,Laurie Halse Anderson,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"The book Fever 1793 is a wonderful book to read if you are like 10-12 years old of course it took place in 1793 it was when Washington lived. This book takes place in Philadelphia the book is about this girl named Matilda she is 12 years old and lives with her grandfather and mother (her father died). Yellow fever come into town and more then a 1,000 people  were killed it was a disaster. All of Matilda family gets sick and has yellow fever even her to find out if she died or not read this book. If u cry when you read sad book then get a tissue box and start reading!!!! :)"
Fever 1793,0689848919,Laurie Halse Anderson,Barnes and Noble,4.5,graciegrace4,"Any teenager would love this book, they can perfectly relate to the main character Mattie Cook. the book begins with Mattie and her mother consistently arguing about when to do chores and work, but Mattie wants the general family coffee shop to turn into Philadelphia's greatest. Just one problem, suddenly the yellow fever strikes Philadelphia causing numerous amounts of sudden death. The yellow fever causes Mattie's family to separate, and endangering their lives. When Mattie arrives in this new land, she realizes that the fever is taking over everywhere. She has to realize how to adapt to a sick environment and survive the fever. 
              Even though the setting is based in the late 1700's you can easily relate to the characters. Mattie is like any teenage girl, she is opinionated and strong willed. The point to view of the book is in first person, from Mattie's perspective. As you read this novel, you may interpret her mother as a demanding housewife but as the story precede you realize Mattie's great appreciation for her mother. If an adult were to have read this novel, they would most likely have a different perspective of the story. 
                 I recommend this book to anyone that loves suspense and history. This book is very suspenseful, you are always thinking about what is going to happen next. It is hard to put the book down! Also this book made me realize history can be very interesting. I felt that it took me back in time. This book was so intense you could feel what the character feels. I loved this book."
Fever 1793,0689848919,Laurie Halse Anderson,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Stephanie_Martin,"Fever by Laurie Halse Anderson is a book about an experience the main character Mattie has with yellow fever. This book is during the mid 1700's, when one of Mattie's relatives gets infected with yellow fever she has to go away with her grandfather. When leaving she went through many struggles, causing her life to become very difficult. Putting her life in danger to save others she cared for, becoming very dramatic.

Fever gave me a very good experience knowing how tough it was during the Fever with not that many families that didn't survive the Yellow Fever. Mattie went through many obstacles that caused her life to change, with her being much more mature and responsible.

In my opinion I believe that the book Fever was a book that taught a historical lesson, however I would have expected something else from the ending of the book. Excluding the ending I enjoyed the book very much for a person who does not enjoy books who are drsmatic. I reccomend this book to anybody who enjoys reading books with drama, suspense, and historical events."
"The Likeness (Dublin Murder Squad, #2)",0670018864,Tana French,Barnes and Noble,4.1,MJinPA,"Since I enjoy knowing as little as possible before reading a story, I will not give away anything about plot or characters.

I knew absolutely nothing about this novel before reading it (I chose it because it came up on my ""Amazon recommendations"" list) and *loved* it. What a terrific idea for a thriller. I haven't felt so afraid while reading a book since I was a kid, and that was thrilling in itself. (Incidentally, I rarely experience books described by reviewers as ""frightening"" or ""riveting"" as such.)

At the very beginning, while a couple of characters were being established, the dialogue was not my favorite - a bit reminiscent of Jodi Picoult or other bestselling authors - but the story completely held my attention, and I think the dialogue would certainly play well were the manuscript converted into a screenplay. As soon as the initial characters were a bit fleshed out, I liked the dialogue much better. I loved the characters and grew attached to many of them. Also, unlike many mysteries with promising beginnings, which too often speed up and fall apart at the end, the pacing was pitch perfect.

Kudos to Tana French. I heartily recommend this novel."
"The Likeness (Dublin Murder Squad, #2)",0670018864,Tana French,Barnes and Noble,4.1,denise_twilight,"Definitely this one was much better than In the Woods, at least from my humble point of view. I had trouble trying to get into the plot during the first chapters, but once Cassie's mission begins, you get into a comfortable reading pace and before you know it, you're on to the last chapter.
It is a well written story that sort of keeps with the general idea of Tana French's first novel which is an unexpected ending full of drama and that has the main character fulfilling her duty but at a high physical, emotional and mental cost. 
As I said for her previous book, give it a shot, you might hate it or you might find a good story to spend a nice quiet afternoon with."
"The Likeness (Dublin Murder Squad, #2)",0670018864,Tana French,Barnes and Noble,4.1,theReader278,I loved The Likeness. It has a story that keeps you entertained for hours. I also recommend In the Woods.
Dead Wake: The Last Crossing of the Lusitania,0307408868,Erik Larson,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"The  amount  of  research  Erik Lawson  did  for  this  book  is  obvious  in the  details . If you  like  fast  paced  and  edge  of  your  seat  non-fiction ,  this  is  a  must  read . Even his  footnotes  are  interesting .  I  learned  more  about  ""The Great  War"" before  the  U.S.A. entry  than  I  did  in high  school . I would  recommend  this  book  to  anyone , only  one  small  part  about  an autopsy  might  be  too  graphic  for  younger  readers"
Dead Wake: The Last Crossing of the Lusitania,0307408868,Erik Larson,Barnes and Noble,4.5,PJtheEMT4,"Dead Wake: The Last Crossing of the Lusitania  by Erik Larson is a poignant dramatized story of the sinking of the Lusitania of WW1.  This vivid drama gives not only the historical details of this pivotal event, but the emotional behind the scenes  drama that you will not read in history books.  I was so engrossed in the tory, especially the powerful account of the ship's demise.  Following the stories of multiple  voices gives the reader a unique omnipotent view of the overall picture.  This is especially moving during the account of the ship's sinking.  Going beyond a simple news paper-esque account, the author, Erik Larsen shares the intimate thoughts and emotions of the passengers as they face death.  A young boy with measles is separated from his pregnant mother in the commotion and panic as the ship is sinking.  His last horrific memory of the event is the haunting image of his mother giving birth in the cold see.  The traumatic image haunts him all the remaining days of his life.  Though the words are few, and the image is recounted in a single sentence, the emotional significance is beyond what the modern reader can imagine.  Another young mother traveling alone with her children finds herself torn between saving her infant daughter is the ship's daycare room or her toddler son sleeping alone in the bunk of her cabin. In a panic, she hands her daughter off to a stranger; next time she sees the stranger, he is scrambling onto a lifeboat- alone! The reader can only imagine the mother's grief and pain in those last moments before the ship goes under.  I found myself gripping the book tightly, hanging onto each word, reliving the horrors of those passengers and their last moments.  AT times I was reminded by the cinematic version of the Titanic- the scramble to get to lifeboats and lifejackets, the panic and the separation of families and parents from their children. Larsen is a talented writer that handles the facts as well as drama in this world changing event.  The sinking of the Lusitania- a bit of history that may occupy only a few lines to a few paragraphs in a history book, is retold moment by moment in extraordinary detail, in this 359 page book.  A number of references are included in the end as well as an index for those students and historians that may wish to use this book as a source in a research paper.  This is a must have for any WW1 or history enthusiast. As a blogger I received a copy of this book published by Crown publishers for the purpose of writing this review."
Dead Wake: The Last Crossing of the Lusitania,0307408868,Erik Larson,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"A truly stunning book!! Erik Larson masterfully braids together the stories of the passengers and crew of the Lusitania, the U boat captain, the British Admiralty, and  U.S. President Wilson in this fascinating book.  This is one of those books that I did not want to put down and zipped through it in record time because it is so well written.  It kept my interest from beginning to end.   I recommend this book highly."
The Jungle Book,0812504690,Rudyard Kipling,Barnes and Noble,4.4,bzedan on LibraryThing,"My mom gave me a lot of classics when I was growing up, all big-text on pulpy paper and bright covers, perfect for the young book nerd. I loved the Jungle Books, I always thought she'd read them too, but talking to her recently, I guess she never read much Kipling. I'd forgotten that the first Jungle Book has side stories about Rikki-Tikki-Tavi and the bit about the elephants dancing and whatnot. Only the first half is really about Mowgli at all. The point of reading this, besides my obvious addiction, is so that I have the story straight in my head during The Second Jungle Book, which had passages that stuck in my brain like nothing else over the years."
The Jungle Book,0812504690,Rudyard Kipling,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"Well, everybody knows the movie... but as it is most of the time, the book isn't better, worse, it's just incomparable! My father read this to me when I was 8 years old, and, although I didn't understand everything in detail, it really opened me up to poetry and literature in general, and, when I later picked it up again, this time on my own, I realised that some of my ideas and principals came straight out of this book... The story is great and deep, the characters amazing and so lovable, and in every line lies a mystery, a question without an answer that the reader will have to solve (almost) alone, with the entire book as their only tool and guide. Just a simple advice: read this book, and then read it to your kids (and while you're at it, have a peek at Kipling's untimely ""so stories"" and my personal favourite ""riki-tiki-tavi"")..."

"I Am Pilgrim (Pilgrim, #1)",1439177724,Terry Hayes,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Qwillery,"I Am Pilgrim is a deeply engaging thriller by Terry Hayes. It's filled with everything I love about thrillers - great characters, a frightening scenario, the slow and unrelenting build of suspense, and a deeply layered story.

Pilgrim is brilliant but so is Saracen, the person he is trying to track down to avoid a disaster of epic proportions. Watching Pilgrim's mind work is a real joy. He's clever and inventive. He is the first to admit to his shortcomings. He does make mistakes. He's not omniscient, but when it comes to investigating he has no peer.  He puts things together is ways that are remarkable yet explainable (and are explained). This adds a great deal of depth and veracity to the novel. We get to see how Pilgrim thinks. He also works hard. He hunts down clues. He's a man of action when necessary.

The Saracen is also very intelligent. His life history is slowly shown to the reader throughout the novel. The reader is privy to why he's become single-minded in his quest to bring down the United States. The Saracen is very, very patient. He is one man, more or less off the grid, planning unimaginable destruction. The plan he eventually concocts appears frighteningly real which heightens the intensity of the novel.

In addition to trying to stop the Saracen, Pilgrim is also figuring out a couple of murders that are unrelated to the Saracen plot. I enjoyed this part of the story as well because it gave me additional opportunities to see Pilgrim in action and see how his mind works.

I Am Pilgrim is a beautifully written novel with excellent pacing, wonderful twists and turns and plenty of action. The story not only switches back and forth between Pilgrim and Saracen, but there are flashbacks to Pilgrim's past. The reader gets to learn quite a bit about Pilgrim's life and who he is. Hayes handles this back and forth and the shifting story lines skillfully. There is a very strong cast of well-developed supporting characters who help or hinder Pilgrim in various ways.

I Am Pilgrim is a nail-biter. Even after 600+ pages I was disappointed that the novel ended. I wanted keep reading about Pilgrim and to be in his mind a bit more. If you enjoy well-crafted, exciting espionage thrillers this is an absolute must read."
"I Am Pilgrim (Pilgrim, #1)",1439177724,Terry Hayes,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"I have never written a review until i read this book. Must have!! Finally a real novel with depth. No skipping of pages like i have done with baldacci, cussler, and even clancy. I will be buying his next book as soon as it comes out.

"I Am Pilgrim (Pilgrim, #1)",1439177724,Terry Hayes,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,Unbelievable novel.  If you like Ludlum or early Tom Clancy - you have found a new author to follow.   I recommend you purchase this book and take a couple days off to read it.  An astounding read and one of the best.  Exceptional work and I cannot wait  for the author's next novel!
Howl and Other Poems,0872863107,"Allen Ginsberg, William Carlos Williams",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"Sure, 'Howl' is considered obscene and graphic, but hey: that's what life is. Allen Ginsberg has written the most HUMAN thing my tired eyes have read. People read it and think, 'ugh... this is all about homosexuals and drugs' but the truth is it's about a man who was loved and admired by another, and had finally gone mad. It's Ginsberg's frustration and bitterness that makes it so poignant. I read it before, and thought the same thing: 'it's about homosexuals and drugs' but I was reading beteween the lines: I wasn't digging what he was saying. Wouldn't you be a tad upset if your eccentric, but very close friend went too crazy? Yes you would. So all of you out there reading between the lines, stop whining and READ the poem."

Go the Fuck to Sleep,1617750255,"Adam Mansbach, Ricardo Cortés",Barnes and Noble,3.7,ptalarczyk,"I am writing this largely to balance out the first reviewer's harsh, humorless remarks. The first reviewer (anonymous) posted that the book will only be read by ignorant people and that the publisher should re-think publication. I would like to point out that if one were to actually read the review from the publisher, they actually recommend this book not be read to children. The sample verses are funny and remind me of other joke children's books such as ""Daddy Drinks because you Cry."" I hope the author and publisher continue this into a series that grows up with the kids including titles ""Go the F*** to school already"" and ""Pre-Teen Girls, Stop dressing like Wh**es"""
Go the Fuck to Sleep,1617750255,"Adam Mansbach, Ricardo Cortés",Barnes and Noble,3.7,Anonymous,"For those who have called this ""abusive"" and ""disgusting"" you are actually missing the whole point not to mention you are either not parents, overly medicated, or liars. The point of this book, if you would have taken the time to read some of the statements made by the author, is to remind parents that we all go through the frustrations of parenting and the strain of getting our kids to cooperate. Though we have this inner dialog in our mind screaming for that 15 minutes of peace that we get when they go to sleep and we have a few minutes to wind down, we still have to suck it up and read that story to them because we are PARENTS! If you do not have a child, your opinion holds no value on the matter, if you do have children then you are either a liar if you state that you have never felt this frustration, or i suggest you go to the doctor and reduce your medication as you have become in-humanly disengaged from reality. The author states that this is a bedtime book for adults not children."

"Mostly Harmless (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, #5)",0345418778,Douglas Adams,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,This book is an awesome climax to the series. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves science fiction or comedy. Douglass Adams should know how much I love this book.
"Mostly Harmless (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, #5)",0345418778,Douglas Adams,Barnes and Noble,4.2,1000_Character_Reviews,"&quot;Mostly Harmless&quot; are the words that now replace all of the writing and research that Ford Prefect has created for the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy...and he wants to know why.  The Vogons are back...still trying to destroy earth, but in a different way than usual.  We also find Arthur Dent jumping through alternate universes trying to find his version of his beloved Earth...and learning that he has a moody teenage daughter spawned from his need to get traveling money.  The fifth and final (at least from Douglas Adams) entry into the Hitchhiker &quot;Trilogy&quot; is probably the most hilarious and crazy entry in the series.  I found myself laughing more at this book than the other ones.  The sarcastic and just plain weird subplots (was Elvis kidnapped by aliens? how many &ldquo;Earths&rdquo; are there in the mish-mash?) and side-stories are simply hilarious.  A great diversion, though I found the ending to be less than satisfying &ndash; very Sopranos-like."
"Mostly Harmless (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, #5)",0345418778,Douglas Adams,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"The book ¿Mostly Harmless¿ by Douglas Adams is the last book in the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy series. This book sums up all of ¿the crew¿s¿ experiences together and finally gives it an ending that I would say suits the book. It all starts out when Trillian gets lost in a time warp and Arthur Dent crashes his ship on a Bob fearing planet. Yes I know it sounds strange that a whole planet fears Bob¿s but that¿s just the humor in the book. The whole book makes as much sense as that first part that I told you about so its not even worth it trying to make sense of everything. Believe me, I¿ve tried this and after using up a whole summer on it I gave up. This overall is a very funny and interesting book and really gets you thinking about the world around you."
Benjamin Franklin: An American Life,074325807X,Walter Isaacson,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"If you are interested in history or politics, this book is a fantastic read about one of our Founding Fathers.  It delves deeply into Mr. Franklin's personality and the reasons behind his behavior.  It also talks about his alleged affairs in England and France.  Whereas Mr. Franklin is a great thinker and wise, this books shows how he could be quite a scoundrel.  Not only is a great book about Mr. Franklin, it is a great book about the the 'colonies' and the early United States.  If you are not a fan of US history or politics, you may not enjoy this book as much."
Benjamin Franklin: An American Life,074325807X,Walter Isaacson,Barnes and Noble,4.2,ConnecticutRichard,"As someone with an unusually deep background in early American history, I almost passed up this book because, of course, we all know as much as we care to know about Ben Franklin. What a surprise! This is one of the most entertaining and informative books I have ever read. I kept looking up and saying, ""I never knew that!""

The author, Walter Isaacson, pushes past the cardboard image of the fat little sage with the witty sayings and the dangerous kite. The real Franklin steps from the pages with so many dimensions and so many (often overlooked) accomplishments that it is difficult to conceive how they could all be packed into one life. He was a man of towering achievements in science, civic organization, politics and diplomacy. 

He also had his demons and he was hated and loved with passion. His family life was bizarre and his evolution to revolution was painful. The story of how England turned an ardent supporter into an implacable foe holds lessons with modern relevance.

If you enjoyed David McCullough's ""John Adams,"" you will love this book. The research is as deep and it is much more readable."
Benjamin Franklin: An American Life,074325807X,Walter Isaacson,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"Issacson's thoroughly researched and eloquently written book about one of the most amazing figures in American history is both educational and thought-provoking. From his timeless life advice, to his many inventions, to his role in the American Revolution, the reader can't help but label Franklin a genius. The writing style appeals to those simply interested in learing more about Franklin and is not just for history buffs. Highly recommended."
The Tiger's Wife,0385343833,Téa Obreht,Barnes and Noble,3.5,hls1966,"This masterwork of modern literature is appreciated by readers who can enjoy a story told from many perspectives, blending modern-day narrative with flashbacks by both the narrator and her recently-deceased grandfather, with forays into folk tale and myth. By the end, all the threads are woven into an exotic tapestry where the present is enriched by the past. While many mysteries are solved, some are deliberately and deliciously left unexplained for the reader to chew on. I look forward to more by this author.  Readers who find it difficult and boring should fault themselves, not the writing. Go back to the shallow end, and don't complain that the water is too deep when you simply haven't learned to swim. And if you don't understand that metaphor, get out of the pool!"
The Tiger's Wife,0385343833,Téa Obreht,Barnes and Noble,3.5,1DANA3,"Beautifully written, haunting, sometimes eerie, the stories mix myth with reality. The narrator, Natalia, is a young doctor. While on her way to vaccinate some children in an orphanage across the border, she learns that her doctor grandfather has left home on a mysterious errand and died not far from where she is headed. His body has been shipped back, but she sets out to recover his possessions and, more importantly, discover why he died so far from home. The stories are connected by common themes of mutilation and death, laying spirits to rest, and bringing the bodies home. The journey through these tales are more important than the final destination. Stories and their importance in our lives, how myth, legend and superstition shape and mold our lives are themes that run throughout the story. Interesting and intriguing read."
The Tiger's Wife,0385343833,Téa Obreht,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Frisbeesage,"The Tiger's Wife is the story of Natalie, a young doctor in the Balkans, who has been raised in awe of her brilliant grandfather. As she was growing up he would often take her to the zoo to visit the tigers. Much later she is traveling across a war torn region to bring vaccinations to an orphanage when she learns that her grandfather has died under strange circumstances. When she begins to investigate improbable and magical stories of the tiger's wife and the deathless man begin to surface. 

The Tiger's Wife is a beautiful and highly unique story told in an entirely fresh style. The tone of magical realism lurking beneath the surface of Natalia's grandfather's practical life is always perfectly balanced, just enough that you can't ignore it, but never enough to sound implausible. Natalia herself can't quite believe or disbelieve and all the while the tiger is there, a shadowy presence in every dark corner. The setting of the exotic and unknown Balkans just adds to the mystery even more.

I truly enjoyed this fantastical book. It is not often that you come across such an original voice as Tea Obreht's and I look forwarding to reading more."
"Poison Study (Study, #1)",0778324338,Maria V. Snyder,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Guest,"Magic Study is the book that you see in the store and you think ...hmmm cool name way better cover art than the rest of my SF/Fantasy collection...I wonder. You pick it up, flip through the pages, don¿t really read any and decide it is probably a gimmick. Then you buy it anyway because the cover is Sooo pretty (and maybe hate yourself a little for being so shallow). You go home, sit on the sofa then read the first page. After than you can't possibly move for the next few hours and finally come up for air with a horrible neck cramp and the utter satisfaction that comes with being in the middle of a great story. You decide that it was your amazing subconscious book-radar that led you to your purchase, not a pretty cover. It has enough of the regular markers of the genre to make it a comfortable read but it is told in such a fresh way with very original twists that make it completely new and enjoyable. Yelena's is a world you will not want to leave. The story continues at full speed through the sequel Magic Study which tells a very new tale but still upholds the quality of the first. The third book Fire Study should prove to continue this tradition upon its release."
"Poison Study (Study, #1)",0778324338,Maria V. Snyder,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Librarian-Next-Door,"This is still, since I read it last year, one of my favorite stories. I read a review on it and gave it a go, with trepidation. ""ANOTHER magic book...well, okay,"" is what I opened the book thinking. The next few hours went by without my knowledge. I eventually had to apologize to my family for neglecting them, and again, when I was grumpy because I didn't get a wink of sleep that night. When people tell me something is THAT fantastic, I am almost always disappointed, because I build it up as something amazing in my head. So I say this hoping that doesn't happen to you, ""Read this book. You'll be better for it. I was not disappointed."" If you need to fall in love with an idea, a character, a thought, a rather hot hero, then this series is it. It will inspire you to be more brave and take chances in your own life."

i was very much looking forward to this book and after reading some reviews, i was a little worried i wasn't going to like it...It was wonderful! you truly get into V's head, his background, his parents. you get more of an understanding about the Scribe Virgin and her Chosen. i feel V truly does get his happy ending, (witch some say was wrong) but if was the only way for him and Jane to truly be together forever. you can't always have your cake and eat it too. there are many surprises in this book which get you ready for Phury's book. so don't let other reviews turn you away for V's story. it really is one of the best (next to Z's) and i recommend every BDB book! these brother's have stolen my heart!"

So far it is the worst of the series BUT BUT BUT the others were so great (especially book three with Zadist) and this one good.  Im glad I read it and personally I loved the relationship bw Butch and V.  Also, read it bc you get to find out what happens to John.

Give it a chance!!"
"Lover Unbound (Black Dagger Brotherhood, #5)",0451222350,J.R. Ward,Barnes and Noble,4.5,ILuvMyNook,"What can I say about this book other than... Oh. My. God.! This was such an emotional ride. Touching, Romantic & Thrilling all get 5 stars from me! So touching and so sad in so many ways. I actually cried reading this book. The life that V started out with, having the Bloodletter for a father. The guy lived up to his name that's for sure. And finding out who his mother is (I'll not say here, so you'll be surprised) and finding that after all his years with his father, dreaming of a loving and caring mother, then to be sooo let down. He goes through so many emotions with his best friend, Butch, then finding the love of his life. This book has so many twists and turns. Some of them will make you want to cry for him, cheer for him, and hope for him... and at some points you'll hold your breath for him. This is my favorite book so far in the BDB series, but then again, V has been my favorite character from the beginning. Don't worry about some of the other reviews that are upset with the ending to this book. It's about love and sacrifice and that life isn't always fair and it's all how you interpret ""Happily Ever After"". I can't wait to read the next chapter which is Phury's story!"
"Going Postal (Discworld, #33; Moist von Lipwig, #1)",0060502932,Terry Pratchett,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Guest,"The hero, or at least main character, is clever but not egoistical, unwilling but not running away, fraudulent and yet with some ethical standards of his own.  Long-time Discworld fans have been commenting that, for the last few years, the series has been getting 'dark', heavy-going with very serious social issues (war, torture, dictatorship) (which I think is what satire is for, satire is social commentary wrapped in humor).  'Going Postal' deals with the slightly lighter issues of the enslavement of Artificial Intelligence (golems), the downfall of a major government office (the Post Office), serious financial fraud, unsafe work environments, and the thoughts of the employees.  This novel, however, seamlessly incorporates the requisite humor.  Readers new to Discworld may find this book more enjoyable than if they started the series with the two previous books 'Night Watch' or 'Monstrous Regiment'.  Old time fans who have felt 'Night Watch' to be too bloody and psychological, or 'Monstrous Regiment' to be too grossly humorous while treating the subject matter inadequately, might have a happy nostalgic trip with 'Going Postal'."
"Going Postal (Discworld, #33; Moist von Lipwig, #1)",0060502932,Terry Pratchett,Barnes and Noble,4.6,DacodaNelson,"I bought the book as a test of my new Nook and because it was the only Terry Pratchett book in digital format that sounded even remotely interesting.  I'd only read a few of Pratchett's books before but I liked his style and decided to give it another go on the bus ride home.  

The book starts out, continues strong, and ends funny yet insightful.  Many of the jokes are dark but they add to the tone of the book.

While it's not the sort of thing that would hold up in a book club discussion, there aren't a lot of brilliant insights, it's a wonderful book for a Saturday morning or a bus ride, it'll keep you laughing and certainly interested."
"Going Postal (Discworld, #33; Moist von Lipwig, #1)",0060502932,Terry Pratchett,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Lion-Reader,"Very similar to Making Money, but as with all of the Discworld novels, they are fun stories to read even when a story line is being reproduced.  Few writers can make an autocratic tyrant a noble character, but that is the charm of Terry Prachett's novels. The heroes come from unlikely sources and the characters, even the minor ones are always engaging send-ups of ""stereo-types"" that go beyond the typical stereo-type."
The Mist,0451223292,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.1,songcatchers,"Imagine this: you are stranded in a grocery store with a bunch of other people, some sane and some not so sane, while a fog-like mist surrounds the store and is enshrouding a mass of creatures that seem from a different dimension. Sound like a creepy story line? It's better than that. Stephen King, the ""Master of the Macabre"", creates some truly out-of-this-world creatures that lurk in the mist. But....he makes the atmosphere inside the store almost as dangerous as the outside by adding in some human pandemonium. It's all about adaptability. Some people don't cope well and start to lose it. The most fearsome by far is the witch-like Mrs. Carmody preaching the end times and expiation. She believed in a biblical reason for the mist. Others suggested The Arrowhead project, a government preserve outside of town. Whatever is behind the mist, it's classic King!"

The Mist by Stephen King was a 5 star action packed horror novel that just keeps on getting more interesting the more you read. This book is great if you enjoy scary, creepy, or just plan weird events. This book kept me guessing as to what would happen next, the whole time I was reading it. There is never a slow part in the whole story. This book deals with how people will react to post-apocalyptic events, it shows how people will pick a leader in that type of situation no matter how silly this leader maybe. I thought that it was interesting the way he show how people begin to go crazy without civilization. This book was one of the best that I have ever read and I highly recommend it."
The Mist,0451223292,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"If you think the movie was great, you haven't read the book. I saw The Mist when it first came out and loved it so much, that I purchased it on dvd as soon as it was released.  Though I was horrified each and every time I saw it, I loved it time and time again. I didn't think it got better, until I read the book. It gets better. It gets more real. It gets you peeking out the windows at night wondering what that noise was. It just plain gets you. Excellent! What I always expect from Stephen King, and what he never fails to deliver to me, a sense of comfort knowing my favorite author still enjoys making us scared, and I love him for the endless hours of fear, anxiety and the unexpected laughs he has given to me. You, Mr. King, are WINNING. Eat your heart out Charlie Sheen. King is simply wonderful."
"Dead Beat (The Dresden Files, #7)",045146091X,Jim Butcher,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"Harry is REALLY getting on my nerves.  His constant whining, his ineffectual attempts at magic, his idiotic propensity to champion the wrong women; it's enough to drive a regular reader insane.  And the worst is his constant insistence that he is very powerful.  Yet, somehow, every villain simply kicks his butt, until some act of god, or rescue by a friend, or sheer happenstance  lets him survive.

I just like my heroes a little mor heroic and less bathetic.  I get the whole concept of a flawed hero, but really, you can take this premise too far, and Mr. Butcher does, on a regular basis.

That said, this outing is well plotted and full of interesting action.  Well worth reading.  Just don't try rereading the series in one big gulp like I did, or you too will be rooting for the villains to finish ol' Harry off, once and for all.  Yes, he's that annoying in large doses."

"Golden Son (Red Rising, #2)",0345539826,Pierce Brown,Barnes and Noble,4.8,Caroles_Random_Life,"Remarkable!

5 Stars!

I am completely in awe of Pierce Brown after reading this book. Seriously, where did this guy come from? I was blown away by his debut novel, Red Rising, and had hoped that this book would be just as good. I think that this book was actually a little bit better than the first book in the trilogy if that is even possible. It is so refreshing to read a follow up novel that exceeds all of my expectations.

This is the kind of book that hooks you right away and never lets go. Even after turning the final page, I found that I want the rest of this story. This book picks up not too long after the events in Red Rising. Hardly any time is spent rehashing the events of the first book which could be problematic for readers who read the first book nearly a year ago since there is so much going on in this series. Since I had just recently finished the previous book, I jumped into this story quite easily. This is not a series that you can jump in just anywhere and not feel lost so please be sure to read the first book before starting this novel.

There were a lot of politics in this book and I found that I really enjoyed all of the complex political maneuvering. Politics are a large part of any change in society. Darrow navigates his way through all of the plotting and plans of others in ways that nobody expects. The things that he does often seem risky and foolish but he is almost always able to pull his plans off.

The characters in this book are amazing. Many of the favorites from the first book are back in the second. We also are introduced to many new characters. I really liked Servo in the first book but I fell completely in love with him in this installment. He is rude, funny, loyal, and most importantly a true friend to Darrow. I also really liked Lorn's character in this book. He has seen and done it all and his wisdom and experience really aided Darrow. I like that Lorn respected Darrow but was never afraid to tell him when he was unhappy with him.

Darrow finds himself at some very high points during this book but he also finds himself in some of the most dire situations. There were so many jaw dropping moments in this story that I lost count. I never knew which way things were going to go and how the power would shift. I must say that the ending of the book really left me wanting for more. I wouldn't call it a cliffhanger ending exactly but I would say that there are a lot of unresolved issues as this installment came to a close.

I received a copy of this book from Random House Publishing Group - Del Ray Spectra via NetGalley for the purpose of providing an honest review."
"Golden Son (Red Rising, #2)",0345539826,Pierce Brown,Barnes and Noble,4.8,tpolen,"While reading Golden Son, I felt as if I were in a vacuum - nothing existed outside of this book - it was that captivating.  Darrow's story is both heartbreaking and horrifying and he performs some monstrous acts to accomplish the overall goal, but I was always in his corner.  He's as charming as he is wily and had some tricks up his sleeve that were pretty surprising.




To say this book is full of action is an understatement.  The body count is quite high, copious amounts of blood are involved, and some of the killing are very inventive, so it's no wonder there's such an extensive list of characters in this series - you obviously can't kill the whole cast.




Which brings me to my only issue with Golden Son.  I read Red Rising almost two years ago and with such a large number of characters, I had difficulty remembering them and what they'd done.  A short summary of the first book or character map would have been helpful.




The world-building is just extraordinary, the characters deep and fascinating, and the storyline full of battles, betrayal, and power struggles with a little humor and romance tossed in.  The Red Rising Trilogy is easily one of the best series I've read and you won't find a sophomore slump in Golden Son.  You don't want to miss this.  




This review is based on a digital ARC from the publisher through Edelweiss."
"Golden Son (Red Rising, #2)",0345539826,Pierce Brown,Barnes and Noble,4.8,Anonymous,"There was never a dull or even a slow moment in both this book nor the first, Red Rising. I literally could not put the book down! I cried, I laughed, I cursed and even when I might have had an idea of what was to come, I was blown away by the twists and turns of this story. I eagerly await not only the third book in this series but any and all books to come from this author. An amazing, exciting and stunning read!"
"The Light Fantastic (Discworld, #2; Rincewind #2)",0061020702,Terry Pratchett,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Ruriksson,"The Light Fantastic is a bit of an odd man out in Terry Pratchett's Discworld series in that it's the only one that really should be read in order. Most of this fantastic series can be read as a stand alone, in whatever order one feels (odd in and of itself for such a large series). The light Fantastic is the followup to Pratchett's Discworld debut The Color of Magic, in which our erstwhile hero Rincewind continues his journey with the Discworlds first tourist, the indomitable Two Flower. It is every bit as offbeat, witty and strangely poignant as the first, and certainly a good start to one of the most interesting fantasy worlds ever created. Highly recommended."
"The Light Fantastic (Discworld, #2; Rincewind #2)",0061020702,Terry Pratchett,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Niveus,I love this book. Terry Pratchett is a never ending well of fanatsy and creativity.

What the Dog Saw and Other Adventures,0316078573,Malcolm Gladwell,Barnes and Noble,3.7,SantaMonicaArtist,"""The trick to finding ideas is to convince yourself that everyone and everything has a story to tell"" (xix). In my opinion, What the Dog Saw is a clever way to gain insight on information that Gladwell calls ""adventures;"" a collection of 19 articles placed into three specific categories: minor geniuses, theories and predictions. I am not usually intrigued by social science or psychology... I am, after all, a senior in High School who prides myself on being an ""abstract thinker,"" ""creative,"" and an ""artist,"" but surprisingly Malcolm Gladwell took particular topics and articulately portrayed experiences with a tone of great excitement and curiosity for the subjects, which allowed me to continue reading the book with an excited anticipation. I understand the arguments from people who had previously read Gladwell's articles in The New Yorker; it was nothing new. But for those craving a logical book filled with facts, and a bit of passion, it was refreshing, to say the least."
What the Dog Saw and Other Adventures,0316078573,Malcolm Gladwell,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Booknut62,"I have read with pleasure Malcolm Gladstone's books ""Blink"" and ""Outliers"" with fascination and interest and with level of intensity that made those two books quite enjoyable. I did not have the same experience with ""What the Dog Saw."" It is not the same. Perhaps Gladstone's attempt to cobble together old columns and writings just does not work for me. I found reading this book and getting through it an ordeal. I always finish a book even when I am not particularly enjoying it. This one bordered on being painful to get through. Then again, it could just be me. I am not a fan of short story books either. Some of the topics addressed by Gladstone were interesting such as the opening chapter about ""The Pitchman,"" but that interest and intensity of writing is just not sustained throughout the whole book. ""Outliers"" and ""Blink"" were thought-provoking, engaging, and fascinating, but this one never rises to the same level. There are books that I would call not very enjoyable, but a worthwhile read. I am sorry to say that I just can't call this one a worthwhile read. I'm afraid this one was one of those published with the hopes that because of Gladwell's previous successes, it would see success as well. I am sure it has sold well, but this is one of those books that can make you not want to read any more by this author."
What the Dog Saw and Other Adventures,0316078573,Malcolm Gladwell,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Henry_Boyer,"I enjoy books and articles that give me a bigger picture of the world.  Malcolm Gladwell does it with prose that is both faced paced and substantive.  Many people will suspect that these reprinted articles from the New Yorker are just a way of cashing in on previous successes, and they may well be, but they are well worth the read.  These insights into human nature and experience, giving us the real story behind people and events, are perhaps the only real truths available to us.  ""What the Dog Saw"" spoke to me on both emotional and intellectual levels in a very satisfying way.  Light, enjoyable reading that informs and inspires is a big part of what good writing is all about.  I enjoyed his earlier book, ""Outliers,"" in much the same way.  But here the greater variety of subjects, each presented with sufficient depth that never bogs down, was even more insightful, expanding and encouraging. With the constant deluge of bad news, and with the winter chill freezing us out even down here in Florida, Malcolm's writing is a fresh, warm and fragrant breeze.  I looked forward to reading ""What the Dog Saw"" in the same way I look forward to getting together with good friends.  However, this book always fit into my schedule."
Pretty Girls,0062430874,Karin Slaughter,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"I love Karin Slaughter and am a big fsn of all.her books. Although I am a  little bummed that she did not go back to Sara Linton and Will Trent, this book was like so many of her others-  just impossible to stop reading until it was finished. Im hopiing that.she can get back to her characters that readers can follow along book after book, but between this and Coptown, it seems like she may be into writing stand alone books for a phase. Regardless, I enjoyed this book very much. As always the characters and plot were well developed.. For the most part it was a good read. The ending lacked a.little for me- it may have seemed a little far fetched but still a good read."

Revival,1476770387,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Anonymous,"Stephen King has been my favorite author for over 2 decades. I've read just about everything he's published, some novels multiple times.
I've been wanting to read 'Revival' since I read a summary of it last spring. I purchased this the day it was published and before long I was totally engrossed in its story.
The book starts by making the reader care about the  characters and creates a need to know where their stories will lead. 
Unfortunately, the last few chapters become tedious and the ending feels thrown together. Almost like SK had something different in mind, but changed his mind at the last minute and just came up with this instead.
I gave this novel 3 stars because (1) it's Stephen King and I'd read his grocery list if he published it and (2) the begining and middle of this story was just so well done.  
Bottom line: if you're an avid SK fan, give it a try just to say you did. Otherwise, skip this one."
Revival,1476770387,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,3.6,JULIANN1,"This one was troubling, though perhaps not in the way King intended. As with so many others, I have been a fan forever, since 1981 and The Stand. While I think King's books are uneven, they are always a class act, and I would follow him anywhere. I was sure the reviews that gave the ending of Revival such a hard time were wrong this time, but having finished the book last night, I have to concur. Until the denouement, I loved the book and it's careful pacing. The great reveal at the end, however, was just sub-par. Not frightening, not fleshed out, not interesting, and certainly not convincing. I was hoping for something more Hieronymus Bosch&mdash;detailed and varied&mdash;instead of a sketch of a line of dead people not even brought into focus. I hate writing this. 98% of it was so good with great potential."
Revival,1476770387,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Anonymous,I have read every single word SK has written. This is the first time that I wanted to scream after finishing the book.  The book starts with a promising and believable premise. I liked the characters and thought they were well developed. The story is interesting and compelling. But the ending was atrocious. It read like something my eleven year old might come up with. Completely ridculous and just awful. Can't really elaborate without revealing spoilers. It was like SK got stuck at the end and threw in some absurd idea from a bad dream. Very disappointing!

The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game,0393330478,Michael   Lewis,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"Living in the third poorest zip code in the United States, very few people get out to lead better lives. In the thought-provoking book  The Blind Side,  a fifteen year old boy named Michael Oher acquires the chance to leave because of his athletic ability. At age fifteen and already six foot five and 330 pounds, Michael has the build of a prototypical NFL offensive lineman. In a once in a million chance a rich white family adopts him and helps him reach his new goal of becoming a sports superstar. Throughout the book, Michael Lewis shifts from point to point, telling the reader about Michael but then explaining the offensive lineman¿s job in minute detail. You learn that Oher¿s mother is on crack, his dad is dead, and he¿s escaped from several foster homes as a child. I simply shook my head in wonder reading this book about how many good and bad things can happen simultaneously. I definitely suggest reading this book, as it is both touching and tells an avid sports fan much more in depth about the game of football than they ever thought. Sean period 4-6"
The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game,0393330478,Michael   Lewis,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"The Blind Side was enjoyable because of it powerful message about overcoming and putting others first. Through out the whole book the Tuogh family goes out of there way to help a young boy that they do not even know. Reading the book made me want to go out in my community and do something to help. Reading about how loving the family was, showed me the proper way for a christain family to act. I love hearing storys of people doing what ever they can to make a diffeance in some ones life that they dont even know, The Blind Side is a the perfect example of this."

"Lirael (Abhorsen, #2)",0060590165,Garth Nix,Barnes and Noble,4.7,farnsworthk on LibraryThing,"This book was so good, I had difficulties putting it down. While I really liked Sabriel, I didn't fully appreciate the world-building until I started Lirael and walked through it again. The world in this series is really excellently done and the characters are interesting as well. The real beauty of Lirael is the library though. I can hope Nix revisits it in the next book."
"Lirael (Abhorsen, #2)",0060590165,Garth Nix,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Pool_Boy on LibraryThing,"Book two of the trilogy was a very good and quick read. The world is still rich and interesting, but I found the two main characters a tad annoying (whining, complaining, unsure of themselves) - granted this was probably by design, but the two-by-four belaboring this point used was not necessary. That said, this is just a nitpick. Still quite enjoyable and looking forward to the final book of the series."
"School's Out—Forever (Maximum Ride, #2)",0316155594,James Patterson,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Karlz,"This book is amazing. I think it is the best book in the whole series (though you should read them all). It's captivating, enthralling, brilliant, thrilling, and just down right hilarious. It may have a lower level vocabulary, but it's characters are just as charming and witty as a master like Shakespeare or J.K. Rowling. The characters are brilliantly developed, and completely realistic. No fake, unbeleivable personalities here. The plotline is complex, full of brialliant twists and turns. Just as you think you've figured it out, Patterson takes you around another bend, and your theory is blown to pieces. But, sometimes books have exciting plotlines in some parts, and boring areas in others. Not Maximum Ride. It's a must read all the way through, from the first page to the last. It may be a fantasy, but it has some very real topics in it, from global warming, to a teen's crazy love life, to an obsession over choclate chip cookies. It's wonderfully written so that you enjoy the fantasy, wish-it-were-you feeling, but also see the real issues portrayed in the book. The characters and emotions are so believable, sometimes you feel it could really happen. I'm a teenager, and I feel exactly as Max does when she's tumbling through her adventures. From her happiness and her excitement, to her confusion and fear, I feel as if I know her, and understand what she's going through. I understand why she does things, or why she doesn't. Basically, she (and the rest of the Flock) are totally beleivable characters. The plot flows with excitement, created by exploding buildings, on-the-fly fights, and an interesting love twist, and the characters are amazingly well developed, creating an all together great book. What more could anyone want?"
"School's Out—Forever (Maximum Ride, #2)",0316155594,James Patterson,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Famousforlove2,"I was orginally asking for Witch and Wizard by James Patterson for Christmas but my mom bought me this whole series instead. I was a little dissapointed that I didn't get the books I wanted but, out of politness I was going to read these books anyways. So I picked up the first one and I loved it. Right now i'm currently reading the fourth out of five. I really like how I can relate to Max, and how that when James Patterson writes it's not always about the same exact thing. Every series has a different plot, and I think that all his books are great. I definetly reccomend these books to anyone who loves to read, it's well worth your time."
"School's Out—Forever (Maximum Ride, #2)",0316155594,James Patterson,Barnes and Noble,4.6,lunaticbibliophile,"when i finished Angel Experiment, i went and welcomed hell just to get my copy of School's out-forever and saving the world and other extreme sports. and you know what? part 2 and 3 didn't disappoint me. the second book focused on Max and the flock trying to find any information about the School and about their parents. Well, you already know they grew on tubes and dog crates so knowing their parents are typically out of their knowledge. When Max started to hear a Voice on her head, she and her flock went to different places in US in search of an answer that can help them solve the mystery of their School, about Jeb, their growing need for a normal life, and Max's and Fang's feelings for each other...about the latter part, it came earlier. 
So, if any of this reviews doesn't catch your attention, better go to the School and try to wake your blood a little bit..."

"Winter (The Lunar Chronicles, #4)",0312642989,Marissa Meyer,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Anonymous,"This story had me hooked from the begining. In this instalment, Cinder, Kai, Scarlet, Wolf, Cress, Thorne, Winter, Jacin, and Iko face plenty of challeges, endure separation, and are foiled by Levana again and again. Winter is wonderful and kind, and an ex cellent character in the series. I won't spoil the ending, but trust me when I say it's --- nope, I won't ruin it. Enjoy Winter, because it is the kind of book that can be read a million times in a row, and you will still find new quotes to smile about and more moments to remember."

"The Warded Man (Demon Cycle, #1)",0345503805,Peter V. Brett,Barnes and Noble,4.4,NickyRay,"The Warded man is another hero's journey of a boy who is thrust from the womb of his home and into the terrible reality he lives. This novel follows Arlen, Leesha, and Rojer, each following similar coming-of-age arcs, jumping years, until they finally converge near the end of the book. Structure is good, but you must stray from it to keep things interesting. The story almost turns into Dune while Arlen is in the desert, but thankfully Brett decided to stop there, and instead give Arlen a Edmund Dantes-esque return as the titular Warded Man. There are some funny bits, some sweet revelations of the good in the hearts of some lowly characters and the action was often bloody and thrilling, but overall the inner story of the characters was flimsy, and Arlen essentially becomes the Batman of his world. 

Brett's prose would have gotten me flayed in school, he almost entirely tells instead of shows, often repeating the obvious multiple times in the same paragraph, then having the dialog repeat it again, never allowing for subtext. He bashes the reader over the head with the apparent, yet neglects details like describing what the demons actually look like until quite a few chapters in. The world that he created feels more like a rough sketch, which would work with a cast of strong and complex characters, but those are missing here. 

Another odd and bothersome aspect of this book is the constant examples of rape, incest, and molestation that permeate the story. About every other chapter has the characters in some conflict with sexual predators, or their own juvenile sexual issues. Particularly Leesha, who in the story is so beautiful that she turns any man alone with her into a drooling rapist. Well written, this may have lent itself to the complexity of the story, but it was not well done. This aspect was clumsy, predicable, and left me cringing more than once, and actually less interested in the character's fates. By the end, it felt like a heavy handed attempt to shape Leesha's and the others characters, but failed to do so. 

Certainly not the worst fantasy you could pick up, but if you want a well done, gritty, fantasy, check out Joe Abercrombie and the First Law series. Or just a great, original fantasy book, try The Name of Wind by Patrick Rothfuss and see how it's done."
"The Warded Man (Demon Cycle, #1)",0345503805,Peter V. Brett,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Angelle,"I received this new novel by Peter V. Brett a couple days ago from Del-Rey for review and so I decided to sit down from my few months being a mom to read it. I was so glad I did. The Warded Man is an intense ride that begins with the lives of three young children that through different diversities survive to fight on in a world where just the corelings or demons aren't the only things that should be feared. 


In this well written novel, you will meet Arlen, Leesha, and Rojer, each set on their own path by tragedy or by the evil of others. Their journeys are all thwart with different types of danger from One Armed demons to the evil of greedy men. Each one will have you wrapped around their stories as they pull you from the world you know into one that nights are feared and demons roam only to take you into that darkness never to return. 


The Warded Man is a well put together novel. With intense actions scenes that do not rob from the brilliant dialogue, the beautiful, yet, horrifying imagery literally engulfs you in a world that is filled with mountains, deserts, wall cities, and small villages. Each chapter brings you deeper into the shadows filling your mind with visions of small fire demons to the large stone ones. 


I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves good fantasy and great action. It is a bit on the dark side with some violence to kids as well as to grown ups so please use discression when looking at it for kids younger than sixteen or so. Other than that, I implore you to give Mr. Brett a chance. I know I will be reading the next in his series for sure....."

"One Shot (Jack Reacher, #9)",0440241022,Lee Child,Barnes and Noble,3.7,kevin-hal,"This truly was an awesome read.  The story starts out with a sniper gunning down five people  leaving work in a small Indiana city.  Although this act of violence was so random, the police  managed to track down the killer very quickly to an ex-soldier named James Barr.  The evidence was perfect against him.  Without a doubt, this man is guilty, or is he?  His few words before falling into a coma, "" They got the wrong guy...Get Jack Reacher for me.""  Lee Child takes you into the mind of Jack Reacher, an experienced and skilled retired soldier.  Jack Reacher, being one of the few that know of Barr's violent past, is prepared to do what ever it takes to expose the truth. 

This book has absolutely nothing to complain about and is possibly one of the best books I have ever read.  You never know what Reacher's got planned next or how he's going to take down his next victim.  In other words, you would not want to mess with this guy.  All in all, a fantastic book which I definitely recommend to all readers in search of a thrill."
"One Shot (Jack Reacher, #9)",0440241022,Lee Child,Barnes and Noble,3.7,MavOR,"I read two Child books in a row:  this one and ""Nothing to Lose"".  the second book is one of his most recent, with an irritatingly political slant; my advice to Child is get back to his earlier formula for the Reacher novels.
""One Shot"" is a great crime thriller with good character development for a genre that is primarily sock 'em, pop 'em plot development.  I especially liked the firing range owner, Cash, with his ex-Marine attitude and laugh out-loud exchanges with ex-Army Reacher.  
An encouraging note to those who have not read Child:  the violence is somewhat explicit, but the sex and language is tasteful and restrained.  Child at his best relies on clever plots and a truly unique protagonist."
"One Shot (Jack Reacher, #9)",0440241022,Lee Child,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Anonymous,"This is a continutation of great writing and drama written by Lee Child.

Duma Key was his first book to take place out of the New England area.  If is not my favorite book written by him but it is in my top five after The Stand, IT, Green Mile and Dreamcatcher.  Duma Key is one of those books I would read until I had to put up because I was ready to fall asleep.  Just a great, great book."
Duma Key,1416552510,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Kasia_S,"Ahh... what can I say about Duma Key, other than it being an extraordinary experience, a literary breath of fresh air, a masterpiece of color and texture without any actual paint being used. I guess there are some people out there think it's boring or long but I instantaneously felt a bond with the book and I can say that I absolutely loved it! The writing itself was so colorful and interesting that I enjoyed each and every page, there was in no rush to get to the ending by any means, but I did like the end, it matched the enigmatic feel of the story and it had a lush, tropical feel to it but it was tainted by something dark and eerie and quite frankly very creepy because it was deadly. Those affected could have never imagine their demise, and whether they believed in it or not, it was coming. I was attracted to this book right away, partially because of the cover; it always begged to be read and as an artist it touched my sensors in ways that kept me thinking of it often so I finally had to sit down and read it and also because one of my best friend who started reading it and I had to follow suit so we could enjoy and discuss it together, it as a real threat to read it at the same time and marvel at the unfolding story.

Edgar Freemantle is a handicapped man who moves to a mythical island of Duma Key, a place that doesn't exist in reality but seems more real than half the vacation spots I've been in. He rents a salmon colored house and starts painting with his remaining arm, paintings that change his life - at first for the better but later he realizes that his new found gift is very hungry, and it hungers for things most precious to him. His recovery seems to progress until he starts feeling his missing arm, at the same time strange storms are coming to the island and things that shouldn't be real are happening, Edgar knows that his paintings have more power and meaning than he could have ever imagined and it's up to him to solve the mystery that has enshrouded Duma Key for generations and left many skeletons during it's rein. The story jumps off the cliff with an appearance of a ship on the horizon, Edgar knows that its not good news, something strange and deadly is on that ship and the closer it gets to him during those storms the stranger the hold on his sudden artistic talents and the results are quite shocking, but hey they make for great reading. After reading it I can safely say that it's one of my favorite books ever, I even got the hard cover version so I could have the full dust jacket with it's glorious art to see while I read the paperback and carried it with me everywhere. This might not be for everyone, but that's totally fine with me, I loved it and it made an impact on me, I'm sure there are people out there who wont like it, and that's fine, It only makes me feel lucky that I'm not one of them!

This story is like an exotic fruit bowl, gorgeous from every angle and full of mouth watering rainbow of flavors. The characters in this tale are extremely realistic, from the kooky and zany to mysterious and deadly, each plays a part that paints such a grand picture that the more I think about it the more I feel the need to read it again, just to dip back into that pool of ""ahh.."" it creates.. It's really hard to explain but this book was marvelous and it made a bond with my imagination, one that will stay with me for a long time. There is plenty of original mystery and horror and love and growth combined with"

The House at Riverton,0330448447,Kate Morton,Barnes and Noble,4.1,JerseyAngel,"For me, this was on of the best novels I have read in some time. In order to truly like this book, you must enjoy a good story. Good stories aren't always filled with suspense and drama. The ending is a wonderful one but sometimes to enjoy the end you must know the beginning. The majority of the book is allowing you to get to know the characters, their relationships, and this is what makes the ending so emotional & satisfying. This is a spectacular debut from a new author who is able to allow us to see the past through the memories of an older woman. We see life through the eyes of a service girl dedicated to the lady she works for. A girl who kept a secret her entire life and finally shares it with the reader. It's been a long time since I felt such emotion after finishing a book."

The story was funny, dark yet positive, and overall very intelligently put together.

I could literally visualize ever magical event with no difficulty as I read. Excellent story to match too!

At times I would laugh at out loud at the madness of his logic, while other times I would be dumbfounded by his incredible line of thinking and view on the world/life.Very few books make me question the way I think/rationalize like this book succeeded in doing.The second part is a story of the underground man, showcasing his thoughts/actions from his journal in story form. I found this part to be a tad boring and drawn out, but interesting as it still held the same logic from the first part.Overall, its verbiage is tough to read depending on the translation you get, and you have to pay extremely close attention - I had to re-read things multiple times to 'get it.' But this is not a book that you just want to finish, you really do want to 'get it.' So take the time to read it slowly, and find a quiet coffee house with minimal distractions, cause it will be worth it."

The Heart is a Lonely Hunter,0618084746,Carson McCullers,Barnes and Noble,3.8,eliza_c,"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers is the 2013 selection for the Big Read project that is sponsored by the NEA to encourage reading in communities throughout the US. In an interview, the author, McCullers, stated that the form for this book is inspired by a musical form,the fugue. A fugue contains a single motif or several motifs that are repeated over and over again throughout the piece. In the novel, the motif is loneliness which is acted out by the central character John Singer who is deaf and mute. The other main characters, Biff, Mick, Dr. Copeland, and Jake struggle with their individual form of loneliness and seek out Mr. Singer who, ironically, is the only person with whom they can communicate and the only person who also understands them. Set in an unnamed Georgia Mill town, the novel opens up a door to another time and place where attitudes towards people with disabilities, different religions, different ethnicities,and surprising political views are dramatically different from today. Published more than 70 years ago, this book is worth taking a look at in 2013."

overall it was a decent book. worth reading once i guess, but definitely not one i'd be likely to pick up again. it had it's moments where i couldn't put it down (towards the end) and then moments where it literally made me want to take a nap after about 10 pages."
The Once and Future King (The Once and Future King #1-4),0441627404,T.H. White,Barnes and Noble,4.1,KrishnaP19,"Most fantasy books have taken a back seat these days. Small-time books are overshadowed with the ever so popular fantasy books of Harry Potter and Twilight. However, I came across a book on my family's bookshelf that revealed to me that small-time fantasy books can provide just as many hours of entertainment as any other popular book. T. H. White's ""The Once and Future King"" is a book I recommend for a great read if you want a simple yet fantasy based tale.

""The Once and Future King"" is a fantasy book based on the young King Arthur and his magical world in Camelot. What I liked most about this book is its use of perspective. The book is surrounded with characters of all types and personalities. The book contains four parts and each part is presented from the view of a different character. All four parts of the book depict King Arthur's rise to power all the way to his death. However, the different characters that present the story are both friends and enemies of King Arthur. For instance, the third part is read through Lancelot's life, who is King Arthur's most trusted knight and protector of Camelot. On the other hand, the fourth part of the book is presented through King Orkney's four sons Gawaine, Gaheris, Gareth, and Agravaine who all wish to see King Arthur lose his throne because of Arthur's past history.

This four-part perspective book is flooded with characters that all have their unique personality. I found this most enjoyable as I made my own opinions about characters. I found it almost like a movie with characters I highly respect and others that generally irritated me.

While characters are a central part of the story, the fantasy elements to the story add a little bit of comic relief to the book. From magical animals to wizardry to even war, this book is filled with both a dramatic plot and side humor all surrounded by its unique characters.

I recommend this book not for those who wish to learn about King Arthur and his Round Table, but for those who want a simple and easy read for the sake of plot and entertainment. This story to me does not have the extreme insightful and enlightening themes that most of us enjoy in books. To me, it is just a straightforward story where you learn to love and hate the characters. ""The Once and Future King"" is just pure entertainment for an escape from reality. It is the epitome of a small-time fantasy book."
The Once and Future King (The Once and Future King #1-4),0441627404,T.H. White,Barnes and Noble,4.1,empeegee,"I loved this book.  Is it the easiest book to read?  Maybe not, but  the complexity of the plot and the richness of the characters, is not easily told.  The first book in the tetralogy is light while each of the following books become darker and more intense.   

This story stays with you long after you turn the final page.  There's a lot to learn about life and humanity here.  I always found the usual King Arthur stories too romantic, too artificial, but T. H. White wrote this story of King Arthur for adults and those who want to think."
The Once and Future King (The Once and Future King #1-4),0441627404,T.H. White,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Luminaria,"I first read this in hardcover, ohhhh..... I'm not telling you how long ago - long enough that I had to get a new copy because the cover fell off! I loved ""Arthur"" stories as a kid, and the historical novels and variations that came out in the 70's and 80's as I grew up. When I stumbled across this one, I was both enthralled and vastly amused. I actually didn't realize that Disney stole the plot and twisted a chapter or two into their cartoon.... silly me! The Book Is Always Better! It's a great read that has a really ""chatty"", conversational tone, that assumes that you not only know a lot about King Arthur, but a little about history as well, or else you miss a lot of the jokes. But even if you do, the wizard who lives backwards and knows the future because it's his past, and the boy who turns into a fish and becomes king of all Briton will steal your heart. Enjoy!"

Each book is a story unto itself but fitted into the context of that wonderfully quirky place called disc world. Of all those novels my favorite is Small Gods because to me even though it is a satire on conventional religion it is also profoundly theological. Reading it has given me a better understanding of my own religious tradition and its context in this complicated place we call Earth. I would recommend this book to anyone who believes in God, doesn&rsquo;t believe in God, or addresses their prayers to Whom It May Concern."

This book is great for that, it gives kids info about orphans and what some people go through, but also the love that gets discovered in this book. In my family, we have a family book club that consists of me, my grandparents and my great grandparents, on my dads side. The book club formed, when I recommended this book. It brought us together, and I hope it will for you too. Don't be discouraged by all the negative ratings, like BORING, or EASY. These things are true to some people, people who don't open there hearts to the struggles of Bud. This review was written by a 10- year old girl, not a parent who heard about the book from their kid, not from a older kid who thinks their grown up. This was written by a true kid who likes what other kids like and loves books.If you don't believe me or want to believe those other negative reviews, that's fine but I cannot express how bad that decision is to pass by this book, it is a must read and will bring your family together. A Perfect gift for the holiday season. :) Happy Holidays everyone!"
Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions,006135323X,Dan Ariely,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Guest,"¿Do you know why we so often promise ourselves to diet, only to have the thought vanish when the desert cart rolls by?¿ This question is one of several asked by Dan Ariely in the introduction of his recent book ¿Predictably Irrational.¿ He subsequently states that ¿¿By the end of the book, you¿ll know the answers to these and many other questions that have implications for your personal life, for your business life, and for the way you look at the world.¿ An equally tantalizing statement follows in which the author describes how a set of events in his childhood cemented a life perspective that is quite different from 'and presumably more insightful than' your average person. Together, these preliminary contents set the tone for some high expectations. What follows, however, is a mildly interesting, sometimes trite, and often oversimplified set of observations and `clever¿ experiments that come across more as products of extensive free time than brainchildren of a truly deep thinker.        While some disappointment stems from the ambitious prologue, a rudimentary problem with Ariely¿s thesis lies in the set-up. He starts early with a summarized definition of classical economics, which surmises that we are all rational and, in every day life, compute the value of all options we face and then select the one that maximizes our gain. Any action we take that is not in our best economic interest, therefore, is irrational, and as Ariely opines, surprising in its very nature. But while rational behavior of participating agents may be the basis of economic theory, very few people spend any time thinking about this theory other than economists. For the rest of us, there is no question and certainly no surprise that our social and economic behavior can be irrational, and we have countless reminders of this every day. We know that too many options can diminish returns 'chapter 8'. We also know that expectations often shape our perceptions 'chapter 9', and nobody doubts the allure of free merchandise 'chapter 3'. At the conclusion of each chapter, then, the reader is left with someone else¿s reinforcing account of what he/she is already aware of.          Whereas related offerings such as Tim Harford¿s ¿Undercover Economist¿ or Nassim Taleb¿s ¿Fooled by Randomness¿ offer technical and less-tangible insights into topics such as economics, behavior, and probability, ¿Predictably Irrational¿ relies too heavily on the concept that the author¿s perspective is deeper than our own. This leads to a distillation of complex psychology 'not to mention biochemistry and evolution, among others' into oversimplified explanations and human trials involving free beer. In the end, one is left with the feeling that the author himself is much more interesting than anything uncovered by his experiments on college kids."
Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions,006135323X,Dan Ariely,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Guest,"I enjoyed reading the book but now that I think about the examples and experiments discussed in the book, I find most of them flawed. So I wondered why I did not catch the flaws when reading the book. I now realize it was because Dan (the author) either cleverly manipulates the readers or he is just a natural at it and does not realize that he is manipulating the audience. So I will reserve personal judgement against him, whether his style is purposely or just inadvertently manipulative. Afterall, he claims to be expert in behaviorial science so I can easily imagine that the book and the manipulative style are an experiment that he is conducting to see how people respond.     So without further ado, let me begin.     His very first discussion is about his personal experience with a tragic severe skin burn, which led him to question how people perceive things and how they rationalize their behavior. In writing about his own experience he draws the reader's sympathy - i.e., he gets the readers off-guard into a sympathetic and trusting mode, whereby they immediately admire him for overcoming his tragedy and delivering great research to the mass audience. Very clever, Dan!     Throughout the book he mentions MIT, Harvard, Berkeley as the places where he conducts research and that he had an offer to be at Stanford - he cleverly drops names of prestigious research schools all in an attempt to create an impression that his work is rigorous. I sub-consciously gave him a pass while reading the book, but now I feel I was duped.     Here are some flaws with the examples and/or experiments he discusses:     1) He suggets that perhaps our ethical compass is coarse - i.e., for most people the compass does not respond to petty theft they commit but does respond to large scale theft they might contemplate but not commit to  -- like not stealing a carton of pencils but willing to steal one pencial from the stationery room. First of all, we don't steal a pencil from a store but we do take from our workplace -- so clearly it is not about the number of pencils but rather the context where the pencil is to be had.    I claim we take a pencil from work without paying for it in cash but not from a shop because we can compensate the firm by working a little harder or longer and at the same time avoiding the transaction cost of purchasing a 10 cent pencil at a store or by trying to compensate our employer with 10 cents in cash.     The reason people don't steal the entire box of pencils is because they don't need so many pencils all they need is one pencil. Dan suggests that people could be honest and purchase it at a nearby store for 10 cents. He ignores that going to the store and then paying 10 cents for a pencil also comes with a large transaction cost, which is a pure deadweight cost which can be easily avoided by just taking the pencil from the office. The social welfare is greater if one just takes the pencil instead of imposing a transaction cost on the owner and on oneself. Even leaving 10 cents with the secretary at the firm entails a huge transaction cost for the firm.  Therefore, it is better to just take the pencil.     Furthermore, our compass works just fine, even for petty stuff, when others take a pencil. Thus, our compasses do in fact respond to petty conduct.     By the way, I would take a pencil from work even when the secretary or the boss is observing me. So I don't think Dan has seriously thought about this issues even though he seems to think he has.    2) The experiment about selling a football ticket (which was won in a lottery) and about buying a ticket is also flawed. The reason why the ticket winners wanted $2400 for their ticket was probably because that was the 'going' price for the tickets in the secondary (scalpers) market, just before the game. And, the reason the students who did not win the tickets in the lottery were willing to pay at most $170 or $175 (he reports two different numbers) is because that is all they"
Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions,006135323X,Dan Ariely,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Guest,"Predictably Irrational is an exceptional book on a number of fronts.    First, from the writing style, it is absolutely accessible and that isn't always the case when academians convert research into a book designed for the mass market. This book is as accessible and interesting to read as Freakonomics was.    Second, this is the first book to do such a thorough job of connecting psychology, human behavior and economics.    This book should be an immediate read for every marketer, salesperson, CEO or non-profit without exception.    When you read this book you'll learn about how you and I make decisions and if you are honest you'll recognize yourself over and over in the reading. You and I make decisions the same way everyone else does. And, as a marketer, a salesperson, a funds solicitor for a non-profit, we'll make more, get more and achieve more to the extent that we leverage these automatic processes.    Most people don't fight or even acknowledge their own decision making processes, they just go through the process. What they think is control is really an illusion as this book so clearly points out. You and I can and are regularly influenced subliminally by the way information is presented.    The chapters on Free and the chapter on The Fallacy of Supply and Demand are invaluable. Ariely's explanation of price anchoring will change how you think about MSRP or even your intitial pricing discussion in sales. His experiement using the last two digits of your social security number is very eye opening. This is also an example of something very easy for you to test in your own marketing organization or social group.s    Interestingly, where at the time of this review we are facing a recession, I find this book essential reading for those who would change the face of the recession as well as the duration.    It was interesting to me to read some of the negative reviews of the book but most of them focused on wanting to challenge the conclusions without reading all of the research papers. And, I didn't see many of the people who were critical provide the level of observational credibility that Mr. Ariely does.    This book just made it to my desktop library, the 10 books I'll refer back to again and again when I create marketing material, influence strategies or consult with clients.    This book is a powerful read."
"The Indian in the Cupboard (The Indian in the Cupboard, #1)",0007148984,Lynne Reid Banks,Barnes and Noble,4.4,caleb_h_WV,"This book is about a boy named Omri and he an Indian and a cupboard for his birthday. Some of the characters in the story are Omri, Patrick, and Omri's two brothers. Omri puts the Indian in the cupboard overnight and then in the morning he heard something in the cupboard and he opened it and he saw the Indian alive. Omri keeps it to himself that his Indian came alive overnight in the cupboard. He builds Little Bear a longhouse to live in. He takes little bear and his horse outside for a ride. Little bear gets hurt outside and then Omri goes inside and he brings the chief alive so he can help Little Bear. Then the chief dies and then little bear takes charge of being chief. Omri didn't want to tell anyone about his cupboard turning plastic toys into real toys. His friend Patrick who gave him the toy and one day he slipped out that he was real. Patrick didn't believe him that he was real and then Patrick wanted to go to Omri's house and see himself. Omri took him to his house to see. When Patrick saw it he wanted one then. Omri didn't want him to have one because he was afraid that Patrick would tell everyone. Omri had to go downstairs for his mom. When he came back up Patrick had made a cowboy real. There is a good ending to the book but ill let you read the book so you can see what the ending is. Now you know some things about the book The Indian in the Cupboard. If you chose this book I hope my review as been helpful to you."
"The Indian in the Cupboard (The Indian in the Cupboard, #1)",0007148984,Lynne Reid Banks,Barnes and Noble,4.4,emma-bear_,"The Indian In The Cupboard by Lynne Reid Banks, was a good book. Yes, it was small for a book for a teenager like myelf to read, but it was still very good. It had a lot of emotion and tension, and proof that everyone is important and special in their own way. I want to find the publishers or Lynne Reid Banks, or whoever decided to have the British to American words dictionary. I hate it when you read a book with British people, and you can't understand any of it. This is a good book to read if you need to do a report for school. Overall, I think anybody between the ages of nine and fourteen would like this."
"The Indian in the Cupboard (The Indian in the Cupboard, #1)",0007148984,Lynne Reid Banks,Barnes and Noble,4.4,will18,"The book The Indian in the Cupboard by Brock Cole is a great book that takes place in the 1930s. Here are some events from the story. For Omri's birthday he got a cupboard with a key that can bring plastic to life. Omri brought a plastic Indian to life named Little Bear. Little Bear wanted to make a longhouse so Omri got him some supplies to make it. Once he makes it Omri's best friend Patrick finds out about Little Bear and gets really jealous so he found a plastic cowboy and brought it to life and his name was Boone. One day Omri decided to bring Little Bear and Boone to school, he gave them both to Patrick and he put them in his pocket but he tripped and thought he had killed Little Bear and Boone. Omri took them after that and went to art class and Boone drew a picture so small that the art teacher was amazed and she thought Omri had drawn it. Late at night Omri and Patrick decided to watch a movie about cowboys and Indians, the cowboys were winning a fight so Little Bear got so mad and shot Boone with an arrow. In the morning Little Bear was complaining because he really wanted a wife, so they went to the shop and bought a plastic Indian to bring to life, but when Omri got home he could not find the magic key and he found out it was under the floor boards because his dad had changed the floor boards. Omri sends down Little Bear to get the key but there is a rat! Down there! The Indian in the Cupboard has some positives and some negatives. One positive is that Omri brings a plastic Indian to life, that is positive because that makes the book very exciting. Another positive is that Omri's friend Patrick really wants to bring a toy to life so he puts a cowboy in the cupboard, I liked that because Little Bear would now have a friend his size. One last positive is that they could not ell anybody about Little Bear or Boone. One negative thing in the book is that the brought a toy doctor to life to help Little Bear get healed, but they did not show the doctor that many times. I also didn't like that Patrick told the principal about the toys because it ruined their secret. Lastly I think they should have made Little Bears wife speak more because she only spoke once or twice. The writing style of the author is very interesting. This book is very easy to read. The author (Brock Cole) uses 1st person. 1st person makes the book better because if the author told the story then you might not understand Omri's feelings that well. Most of the words in this book are very easy to read. All of the topics that Brock Cole writes are very clear. This book has some recommendations and some not recommendations. I would recommend this book because it is very interesting how Omri brings a plastic Indian to life. I also like how Patrick brings a cowboy to life and it becomes friends with Little Bear. I would also not recommend this book because the whole book is pretty much in Omri's house. Here are some similar novels to this book. They are actually all in the same series, the 2nd book in the series is called The Return of the Indian, the 3rd book in the series is called The Secret of the Indian, the 4th book in the series is called The Mystery of the Cupboard, and lastly the 5th book The Key to the Indian. The Indian in the Cupboard was a great book."

Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,1419701762,Jesse Andrews,Barnes and Noble,3.8,ReadMe11,"Don't start this book with any expectations and you'll thoroughly enjoy it. The language is vulgar, but not too terribly distracting, since you're reading from first person perspective. I found myself laughing out loud when reading this book. I was reading quotes and passages to anyone who would listen. Although this book has a character that has Leukemia, this is not the main story line. It's more a story about a boy's journey in discovering himself during his senior year. I did tear up at the end, but I cry watching Hallmark commercials. I enjoyed Greg's character, and yes you wanted to smack him around a couple of times, but guess what...that's what helped build his character's story. Was it profound? No. Was is didactic? No. What is WAS...was wonderful! Could this book have been better? Sure...but I think I like the fact that it wasn't very heavy-handed. Take a chance and read this book. As a mom, I wouldn't let my young teen kids read this, but definitely I would let my older teens read it."
Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,1419701762,Jesse Andrews,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Anonymous,"It's two dollars cheaper, better written, has more likable/believable characters, will make you laugh more, and is one of those remarkable books with cancer in them that doesn't treat the entire deal like saccharine tragedy porn. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is the natural answer to TFIOS, and it outshines it in every way. For readers who didn't like TFIOS, particularly those who didn't like how terminal illness was handled in that text, read this one. You'll be better for it."

It just so happens this is one title my students had yet to mention. 
Upon the recommendation of the  bookseller at BN, I decided to purchase it in the hopes that I would be able to share it with my students.
Unfortunately, while the premise of the novel is amusing and the characters are mostly likeable, I found some of the content to be more adult in nature than I would feel comfortable with in regard to my students. Granted, they've all probably read, said,seen, etc., words or phrases like this before but I feel recommending this book as their English teacher would be rather inappropriate.

"The Ugly Truth (Diary of a Wimpy Kid, #5)",0810984911,Jeff Kinney,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"This entire series is fantastic and I would highly recommend it to any parent who has a reluctant reader in their house. Sure, it's great for the highest of readers, too, and that's what a great author does. Similar to the Harry Potter series in that it appeals to a large group of readers, all the books were funny and dealt with humorous issues on so many levels of understanding. Funny for the 8-year-old and equally funny for the 13-year-old. I have a lot of trouble finding books for my 9-year-old son and he is very picky. This will be a sure hit. Another book I'd recommend to those of you in my situation would be ""Did You Ever Wonder"" by Brendan Lynch. It's one of those humorous books that my son loves. The day he got it he kept reading entries to my husband and I. I'm always on the hunt for books for him though so I'll keep searching!"

"The Professor and the Madman: A Tale of Murder, Insanity and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary",0060839783,Simon Winchester,Barnes and Noble,3.9,cookiepam,"I love Winchester's slant on this topic - I was not particularly interested in reading either book - my mother kept bugging me to get them, then she finally got them for me.  Of couse, she was right, and I was wrong.  I was delighted by Winchester's quirky slant on the history of the OED.  I had never heard any of the human stories about the compliation. I will now never be able to pick up an OED without thinking of the people who created it.

I am surprised that the Barnes & Noble rating categories do not allow me to rate the book on: research, writing and intellectual stimulation.

....  did you know that the OED continues to take submissions for new words, and new uses of words?  I think that this is a perfect example of intellectual stimulation."
"The Professor and the Madman: A Tale of Murder, Insanity and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary",0060839783,Simon Winchester,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"The subject of Winchester¿s book is Sir James A. H. Murray, editor of the 'Oxford English Dictionary,' and Dr. William C. Minor, the American volunteer who worked on the 'O.E.D.' for 20 years while an inmate in the Broadmoor Lunatic Asylum for the criminally insane. I am a New York playwright who, in 1995, completed a full-length drama focusing James Murray and William Minor, called 'The Dictionary,' and whose help Mr. Winchester sought when he was first considering writing his book. 'Winchester mentions me in his Acknowledgments.' There is a serious problem with Winchester¿s book. Mark Rozzo characterizes it perfectly in his 'Washington Post' review of 'The Professor and the Madman': '. . . we¿re never sure when Winchester is cleaving to facts and when he is fictionalizing.' Winchester also missed some significant information in his book. Moreover, there are a number of inaccuracies in 'The Professor and the Madman.' About Minor¿s death Winchester writes, incorrectly, 'There were no obituaries.' An obituary was published in 1921 in 'Yale University Obituary Record of Graduates Deceased During the Year Ending July 1, 1920.' From this obituary one learns that Minor was born in the East Indies  that he entered the Yale School of Medicine in 1861 and was graduated in 1863  that he was incarcerated at Broadmoor, transferred to St. Elizabeth¿s in the U.S., and later transferred from St. Elizabeth¿s to The Retreat, in Hartford, where he died on March 26, 1920. The Yale obituary also mentions his brother Alfred. Winchester refers to the lawyer who defended Minor in his murder trial, but does not mention the lawyer¿s name. My research suggests that the person who defended Minor is the same one who defended Oscar Wilde. The man¿s name is Edward Clarke. I am surprised that Winchester did not seize upon this possibility. Winchester theorizes that Minor¿s clinically paranoid dread of the Irish, and of the Fenians in particular, was the result of his experience as a Union Army Surgeon with Irish troops during the Civil War. Winchester neglects the fact that during the years that Minor was stationed in New York 'on Governors Island' the Fenians were, in fact, his real enemy. Minor lived in New York during 1867 and 1868, when the local papers frequently covered events pertaining to the revolutionary movement in Ireland and to activities of the Irish in New York. In March of 1867 the Irish cause held the front page of just about every newspaper every day. It was during the week of March 18 that the expectation of a Fenian attack on Canada, still part of the British Empire at that time, appeared in at least three separate articles in three different papers. News of U.S. troops being moved from New York to the border to thwart the offensive also made headlines. That Minor would have been selected to assist in the battlefield action against the Fenians is not unlikely. This attack never took place  however, less than a year before, the Fenians had staged an assault on Canada from New York State. Eight hundred Irishmen crossed the Niagara River and captured Fort Erie. They were subsequently defeated by U.S. troops, and about 700 Fenians were arrested. Minor would have known of this. Winchester mentions the American vice-consul-general and quotes a letter of his to the Medical Superintendent of Broadmoor, but neglects to cite his name, which is Joshua Nunn. Winchester also failed to locate a series of twenty-two letters by Joshua Nunn, an important source of information regarding Minor. The letters to Minor¿s family and friends in America contain particulars that conflict with some of Winchester¿s assumptions regarding Minor¿s life at Broadmoor and his relations with his family. Joshua Nunn clearly went beyond the call of duty in his assistance to, and profound concern for, Minor. Nunn was the man who handled all the details of Minor¿s legal situation as well as Minor¿s living conditions at Broadmoor. He was also very involved in the press account"
"The Professor and the Madman: A Tale of Murder, Insanity and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary",0060839783,Simon Winchester,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"I never realized how much work was needed to make a dictionary or any reference book at all, until I read The Professor and the Madman.  This book has a good explanation on how the Oxford English Dictionary, the most complete dictionary of the English language was started.  Now that may not make for a very interesting story, but the events that took place, and the people involved with this historical event are interesting.  The story is told somewhat slow, and may not make for a very easy read because of it, but the book picks up and becomes much more interesting when you learn more about Dr. Minor and James Murray.    	The tales of Dr. Minor make for a very interesting story alone.  Dr. Minor lived on the island of Ceylon until he was fourteen, when he was sent to live in New England.  He went to Yale and became a surgeon, and served at the Battle of Wilderness in 1864 where his mental problems most likely started.  At one point he had to brand Irish deserters during the war which contributed to his dementia later in life.  After looking at some information Dr. Minor I found one thing that the author left out.  At one point in the book the author wonders how Dr. Minor could have had such knowledge on dictionaries, but he contributed to The Great American Dictionary before moving to England to try to recover from his problems.  	The theme of the book is the making of the Oxford English Dictionary, and the tale of schizophrenic Dr. Minor and James Murray.  I liked reading about the doctor and his problems  it was an interesting topic, though Murray¿s wasn¿t as interesting there are several details that make for a good read.  The parts about the history of the Dictionary before Minor was involved weren¿t too interesting, but it was somewhat necessary.  One other thing that made this hard to read was the fact that it is a very hard book to read if you don¿t have a very big vocabulary.  There are a lot of seldom used words for everyday vocabulary, and many I had never heard before.  I would recommend this book to anybody who is interested in reading a history of the Oxford English Dictionary, and the impact it had on the time period or just tales of mental problems."

"The Complete Maus (Maus, #1-2)",0141014083,Art Spiegelman,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"The Complete Maus was an amazing book to read! Art Spiegelman's description of his father's life during World War II gives the story a personal feel that completely draws you into the book. However, Spiegelman's somewhat blunt descriptions of the horrors that occurred in the Jewish ghettos and the concentration camps also make this a depressing read because Vladek, his father, witnessed so many tragic deaths. Additionally, Maus is filled with ""present day"" scenes in which Spiegelman shares his difficulties in extracting the story from his father and it also helps tie in aspects of WWII with current events. One of the most heartbreaking parts of Maus was the connection Vladek had with his first son, Richieu, who was killed when he was a very young child. Even after Vladek's wife, Anja, gave birth to Artie (the author of Maus) he still lamented the death of his first son, which is a key part of Maus and helps keep the reader engrossed with the story.   
	One thing readers should be cautious about is the depth of the story. Although it is written as a comic book, Maus is filled with as much sadness and hope as any other Holocaust book. So, just make sure that if you pick up Maus, you don't begin reading it thinking it will be a ""light read,"" because the truth behind Spiegelman's words will knock you over. Also, readers should know that there are brief references to suicide, hangings, and extreme violence within both Maus novels, so if you can't handle those topics, don't read Maus. However, The Complete Maus is also filled with Vladek's struggle for survival, and although it is over one of the most tragic periods of history, I highly recommend that you read it. I give The Complete Maus 5 out of 5 stars, easily."
"The Complete Maus (Maus, #1-2)",0141014083,Art Spiegelman,Barnes and Noble,4.6,cloggiedownunder,"The Complete Maus is a Pulitzer Prize winning graphic novel by American editor and comics artist, Art Spiegelman. It is a memoir in comic form that documents recollections of the holocaust, as told by Spiegelman’s father, Polish Jew Władysław (Zeev/Wladek/Vladek) Spiegelman. The story itself is one that has been told countless times, but Spiegelman’s treatment of it makes it unique. As well as his father’s recollections, he illustrates the passing of the story between father and son, thus inserting himself (including his impatience and ingratitude) into the story.

Maus I (My Father Bleeds History) runs from mid-1930s to winter 1944 and details his parents’ courtship and their experience of the war, through the German occupation and being rounded up to live in the ghetto, up until they were taken to Auschwitz.

Maus II (And here my troubles began) is divided into five chapters and runs from winter 1944 until the immediate post-war period, with Artie’s history taking finishing with his father’s death. It covers his parents’ time in Auschwitz, displacement camps and their eventual reunion.

As with all graphic novels, it can be difficult to distinguish between characters, especially when most of them have the head of a mouse, and sometimes the speech balloons are so small that they make reading the dialogue a challenge, particularly for readers of a certain vintage. But it is immediately clear that a great deal of work has gone into this work, and Spiegelman is obviously a very talented graphic artist, telling an important story."
"The Complete Maus (Maus, #1-2)",0141014083,Art Spiegelman,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Guest,this book much like the first maus i could not put down the story boarding is very good.  you won't find a better book that teaches both the horrors and hardships of the jews during the holocaust.
"The Eyre Affair (Thursday Next, #1)",0142001805,Jasper Fforde,Barnes and Noble,4.1,LinusRenee,"When I first picked up The Eyre Affair, I had no idea what to expect, other than friends saying I would love it. Well, they were right!
Jasper Fforde creates this amazing world of a very strange 1980's England, where the door-to-door proselytizers are Baconians, trying to convince you that it was Francis Bacon who was responsible for the works under ""his pen name"", Shakespeare. Oh, and time travel is a matter of fact, the Crimean War is still being waged, and dirigibles are the way to travel the sky!
The story woven in, around, and because of this world had me hooked pretty quickly. Mixing my knowledge of literature with this topsy-turvy world of literary detectives, Fforde captures the imagination and doesn't let it go!
Before I finished reading it, I went and bought all of his other works. It's become the first book I suggest and the one that I haven't stopped talking about yet! Go read it!"
"The Eyre Affair (Thursday Next, #1)",0142001805,Jasper Fforde,Barnes and Noble,4.1,yoop,"When I first heard about this book, I was intriqued by the plot concept.  I have so many books that I have unread at home but the plotline was compelling me to buy yet another book.  I absolutely love Jane Eyre and had actually just read about half of it prior to picking this book up.  As I began to read this story I was amused and drawn to the characters first by their creative names and then by their quirkiness.  I found the lead character Tuesday Next to be believeable and interesting so I had no problem moving right through the book at a quick pace.  What I found the most amusing was the melding of science fiction, a bit of romance, fantasy and good ol humor mixing it up!If you are a fan of classic literature you will appreciate the story line.  I would highly recommend this book.  I think it would be a super fun book club selection when you get bogged down in serious literature.  It was a breath of fresh air for me!"
"The Eyre Affair (Thursday Next, #1)",0142001805,Jasper Fforde,Barnes and Noble,4.1,LitElephant,"A wonderfully clever novel -- this is definitely something any lit-nerd out there should look into! Though I think Fforde could use some work on his pacing, ultimately his plot was inventive, funny and exciting and the world that he writes is extremely well-created. Thursday is engaging, and not too feminine-- male readers could also relate well to her, I'm assuming. I'm looking forward to picking up the next one in the series!

The Art of Happiness,1573221112,"Dalai Lama XIV, Howard C. Cutler",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"This book is suppose to represent the Dalai Lama's views on happiness. Readers should know right off the bat that the Dalai Lama didn't actually write this book. Rather, the book is written by a Western psychiatrist who has had extensive converations with His Holiness. To insure that there were no ""inadvertant distortions"" of the Dalai Lama's ideas as a result of the editorial process, the Dalai Lama's interpreter reviewed the final manuscript. You be the judge as to whether that means this there was nothing ""lost in translation"". So who is this Dalai Lama, aka ""His Holiness"" anyway? And, why should we read a book about happiness by him? Well, the Dalai Lama is the spiritual and political leader of the Tibetan people according to Tibetan Buddhism- which in my book makes him a person I'd want to listen to when he talks, especially when it's on one of my favorite subjects, happiness. And if this all sounds like an interesting topic for a book, you should read it- you won't be disappointed. Now this is the kind of book I could write a long review of- simply because there's just so much wisdom packed into it. But, I think I'll take a short-cut with this one and just hit the highlights. The Dalai Lama believes that the very purpose of our life is to seek happiness. Other happiness books have also taken this same position. For example, the book ""Finding Happiness in a Frustrating World"" refers to happiness as ""the ultimate pursuit"". On this most will agree, but what exactly does the Dalai Lama tell us about finding it? As with most of his ideas on things, the concept is clear and simple: happiness can be achieved through training the mind. According to the Dalai Lama, one begins by identifying those factors which lead to happiness, and those factors which lead to suffering. Having done this, one then sets about gradually eliminating those factors which lead to suffering and cultivating those which lead to happiness. That is the way. To that end, that's exactly what makes up the majority of this book's pages- ways to eliminate factors in your life that lead to suffering, and learning to foster those factors that lead to happiness. Some specific topics include: -facing suffering -dealing with anger, hatred, and anxiety -building self-esteem -deepening your connection to others When all is said and done, I'd have to say that the time you spend mulling over the book's 300-plus pages is going to be well worth it. For most readers, the Dalai Lama's wisdom and views will probably be very beneficial, if not transforming. Happy trails!"

The Art of Happiness,1573221112,"Dalai Lama XIV, Howard C. Cutler",Barnes and Noble,4.4,yjeva on LibraryThing,"This book changed my life - perhaps only in a small way, but significantly - with the concept that the purpose of life is to find happiness. I had the idea that seeking happiness was ""bad"" - making other people happy was ""good"".  But now I know that if I seek to be happy (as opposed to seeking pleasure) I will automatically do good for other people.It didn't disappoint or bother me at all that it was written by someone else as the words and ideas were clearly those of the Dalai Lama."
The Bone Clocks,1400065674,David Mitchell,Barnes and Noble,3.4,Angie_Lisle,"I love Mitchell's writing; the man certainly knows how to turn a pretty sentence. This book is formatted similarly to Cloud Atlas, with six nested parts that collaborate to move the plot forward, and what I stated in my review of Cloud Atlas holds true for this book as well: when you think of this book in outline form, mind-boggling. Then, that outline gets weighted down by words.

And I felt the weight of this book even more so than I did with its predecessor.

I started out high on Holly Sykes in 'A Hot Spell.' I fell absolutely head over heels into the first part of this book. Then, I hit the second part of the book, 'Myrrh is Mine, its Bitter Perfume,' and that crush ended fast. Juxtaposition is the only reason I can come up with to explain such a droll section. I read 'A Hot Spell' in one day but it took a week to get through 'Myrrh is Mine, its Bitter Perfume' because I despised the main character, the pretentious narcissist Hugo Lamb (after this section, I returned to the schedule of reading one section per day). I briefly wished that I could pop into the story just to slap Lamb around a couple times. And by slap, I mean palm strike to the forehead with enough shoulder-backing to throw the little d-bag back on his egotistical behind. I celebrated reaching the end of this section. Seriously, I sprung for expensive craft ale.

The third and fourth parts, 'The Wedding Bash' and 'Crispin Hershey's Lonely Planet,' dragged with verbose meanderings that wander off-point and convey small amounts of information pertaining to Holly. The future that's coming later in the book is set up here, with Mitchell showing readers what parts of the real world shape his future world. But, half the fun of a fantasy is the escape from the mundane real-world and it's the lengthy delivery of these details that matters after finishing the next two sections, 'An Horologist's Labyrinth' and 'Sheep's Head.' Especially 'Sheep's Head,' set in the year 2043, which has a back-story chock full of all kinds of amazing events that we never read about because Mitchell chose a brief telling of events during conversation rather than showing us - which wouldn't bother me if the third and fourth parts had been delivered in the same manner.

However, I loved the way Mitchell ended this book. I even like the way he wrapped up Hugo Lamb; it felt like an apology for making me want to hit Lamb so bad.

I received a free advanced reader's copy of this book from First Reads in exchange for a review."
The Bone Clocks,1400065674,David Mitchell,Barnes and Noble,3.4,Anonymous,"Good writer, but ill be hesitant to read another by him. Lots of seemingly pointless info; the plot i picked  up the book to read could have been told in 40 pages. Another reviewer said it best ""mostly empty calories"". If he writes a book with full calories id read it for sure; but i didnt even read the end of this one, nor will i have the desire to. I do like his writing, just not in pointless bulk.  I like how he portrays peoples thoughts, its very real. Maybe i missed the point, searching for the paranormal aspect."
The Bone Clocks,1400065674,David Mitchell,Barnes and Noble,3.4,Books4Tomorrow,"Spanning a time period of about fifty-nine years, The Bone Clocks is a captivating and highly stimulating read. The story follows Holly Sykes from her teenage years, through numerous paranormal encounters, to her old age when she tries to make an existence in a disintegrating world.

Although this lengthy novel provided me with five days of intense reading, I can truly say that it was worth every minute. Apart from the beautifully written prose, I loved the well chosen bits of well-known poetry and prose from popular works quoted at appropriate places in the story.

The characters are masterfully crafted, fleshed out and absolutely lifelike. Holly Sykes, the main character, starts off as a rebellious teenager who runs away from home simply because her mother disapproves of her boyfriend. Throughout the book she shows growth until, at the end, she is a great-grandmother in charge of young children in a near-apocalyptic setting. 

Other remarkable characters include the womanizing, thieving student, Hugo Lamb aka Marcus Anyder, a bestselling writer with a serious grudge, and Ed Brubeck, a father who tries to convince himself that he isn't a war-zone junkie. Then there are the mysterious body hopping Immacul&eacute;e Constantin and the strangely reincarnating Marinus; both of whom are hugely paranormal. The question is: which of them is really the bad guy in this tale?

The Bone Clocks presents the most believable end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it scenario that I've ever encountered in a book. It is so logical and realistic that the Endarkenment, as it is called, turned out to be the scariest part of the book for me. 

For an engaging read with tons of action, brilliant characters, and a completely captivating storyline, I recommend The Bone Clocks as an absolute must-read! (Ellen Fritz)"
Black and Blue,0385333137,Anna Quindlen,Barnes and Noble,3.8,sweetpeaSP,"This one starts where most end. This is the study of the aftermath of Fran leaving Bobby, an abusive relationship... of her not as a victim, but as someone struggling to rebuild her life. The fact that she stayed in the marriage as long as she did is completely believable, and is evidence of the fact that smart women sometimes make wrong choices. Her struggles are realistic and both joyous and frustrating, as she discovers herself in her new-found freedom. Here's the story of why women stay in these horrible relationships, so often because of the cost of escaping. The story goes back and forth between the present and the past, to show the reader the gradual, inch by inch way the abuse begins and escalates and how her self-confidence and self-esteem are destroyed until the woman fears for her life. This is both heartbreak and triumph, and emotional without being depressing. This is more interesting than you might think. I thoroughly enjoyed it. 

Another book I'd like to recommend, kind of on the same wave length about a woman's spectacular triumph over abuse. This one will have you crying one minute and laughing and sighing the next....EXPLOSION IN PARIS....WONDERFUL emotional experience!"
Black and Blue,0385333137,Anna Quindlen,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Guest,"I just finished reading this book last night and went to bed with a huge pit in my stomach.  The first section of the book gives you the history of why she needs to get away and how she does it and then it goes into how she manages her new life with her son, but the ending is absolutely horrible.  Yes, in some minds it could be called a reality check, but for myself and other parents, it's the unthinkable. I couldn't get this book back to the library fast enough this morning.  And I couldn't hug my son enough times before leaving for work.  I would not recommend this book."

Diary,1400032814,Chuck Palahniuk,Barnes and Noble,3.9,gates,"This is the only book I've ever finished and had to re-read within the week to catch the details I missed the first time through.  Definately off beat, from an author who's known for off beat.  Wish I could have shared this with a book club."
Diary,1400032814,Chuck Palahniuk,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Jodi_Ann_Hanson,"I really enjoyed this book. Chuck Palahniuk's protagonist Misty writes in a diary to her comatose husband Peter, detailing their lives and the current happenings on Waytansea Island in case he comes around.

Peter's coma is the result of a failed suicide attempt. While he is in the coma Misty learns of hidden rooms in the homes he has recently renovated. Each of the rooms is covered with graffiti of Peter's anger and warnings to the inhabitants. She is called to each home and threatened with lawsuits by the owners. At the first of these occurrences Misty meets a fellow named Angel who seems to take an interest in the graffiti and ensconcing himself into Misty's life.

Soon strange things begin to happen to Misty, she begins having horrible headaches and finds herself in a trance-like state with the only thought in her mind being painting. She is pushed by her mother-in-law, daughter and the residents of the island to paint every time she is in their presence. She is compelled to pick up her paintbrushes and spends weeks locked in an attic room of the Island's historic hotel painting with such a fervour she forgoes eating and wears a catheter so she won't have to leave her work. Once she is done she has created 100 paintings that are all part of a large painting she has never seen that is to be revealed in an exhibit for the summer people which flock to the island.
 
With the help of Angel, Misty uncovers a tradition to replenish Waytansea's wealth by bringing a female artist destined for greatness to the island by marriage to one of their sons. The son gives his life as a sacrifice which is the catalyst for the process to begin. The one thing the inhabitants of the island don't count on is that Misty's husband Peter is homosexual and Angel was his lover and the confidant of his disdain for the tradition and also the man Peter is intent to run away with.

The book comes to an end with a final twist the reader doesn't see coming. Chuck Palahniuk proves once again what a talented writer he is and will continue to be thrilling the reader in a way no other can."
Diary,1400032814,Chuck Palahniuk,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"Its been awhile since ive read this story, but it has stuck in my mind and i felt it needed to be rated. I thoroughly enjoy Palahniuk's work. this particular book had a certain mystery to it(as do many of his other novels)that kept me involved. I couldnt wait to get out of work just to read this book, The Diary. I highly recommend it to people who just enjoy a good read. It keeps your interest, and keeps you guessing. Palanuick has such a way about his writing, that makes it hard to put his books down. His imagination is truly inventive. If you have never experienced Mr. Palahnuick I suggest you go out and buy one his books. if i had to describe his style I'd say blunt, outlandish, and at times can be a little twisted."
"Eleven on Top (Stephanie Plum, #11)",0312985347,Janet Evanovich,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"The Stephanie Plum series is all about the romance. The relationship aspects of the series are the parts that the author plans out two to three books ahead of time. The rest of the story follows where she wants to take the relationships book to book. Sounds like more of a romantic comedy than a mystery series. The author will keep rolling out these books and her fans will keep eating them up. Why mess with a winning formula? I used to wish that the author would take this series further, stretch her creativity and talent and bring back some of the freshness that made the Stephanie Plum novels and characters so original. But I haven't seen anything new for at least half the series and now don't expect anything but more of the same each time I read. They're still entertaining but no longer exciting. Too bad. It used to be such a sassy series. Now it seems more lazy then anything else."
"Eleven on Top (Stephanie Plum, #11)",0312985347,Janet Evanovich,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,The first book in this series was funny and entertaining. Now it is obvious that the author has run out of steam. All the characters sound the same. Glad I got this from the library.
"Eleven on Top (Stephanie Plum, #11)",0312985347,Janet Evanovich,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"I have read all 11 in the Stephanie Plum series, and Janet   keeps finding new things for Stephanie to do.

"Inkspell (Inkworld, #2)",0439554004,"Cornelia Funke, Anthea Bell",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"I loved Inkspell. It had love, pain, and fantasy blended together perfectly so that the reader would see and feel what was happening to the characters.  You could picture the hatred in Mortola's eyes, so deep that you could get lost in it, as she hurt Mo, feel Resa's giddiness when she realized that she had her voice back, and then her pain as she watched her husband get shot, and smell the Inkworld air as if you were standing there next to the characters.    	In this sequel to Inkheart, Orpheus reads Dustfinger back into the world that he came from, leaving his marten, Gwin, and his faithful companion, Farid, behind.  Farid then runs to Meggie, who reads him into Inkworld and at the same time did something never accomplished before-she read herself into a story.  She left a note for her mother and father, who then had someone read them back into the story.  When they get there they find out that Mortola had followed them, which is when she shot Mo with a rifle from their world.  Meggie hears word that her father is hurt, and panics.  Will he survive?  	This book is an amazing sequel to another amazing book.  I liked this book even more than Inkheart, and I couldn't put either one down.  It may be slightly difficult to read at times and the length was intimidating, but it is even better than the one before it, and it's worth it.  You cannot read Inkspell and fully understand it without reading Inkheart first.  I would recommend these two phenomenal books to anyone that enjoys reading stories about adventure, magic, and fantasy."

But, I wanted to know how the story ended.  So, I finally picked this one up.  I'm very glad that I did.  The story was much richer than the first book.   It was written better with the characters coming to life more.  Maybe it's because we finally get a look at the world that everybody was willing to go to such lengths for.  It's almost like the author was able to write about a fantasy world better than the real one.  I found the danger more real and the bad guys gave off more of that evil persona.  I was just overall more impressed with this one.   Believe me, I will be picking up the last in the series soon!"
"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto",0743236017,Chuck Klosterman,Barnes and Noble,4,NerdFighter_92,"Have you ever eaten Coco Puffs? I bet you didn't realize the sugary cereal you were ingesting was original conceived by the ideal to help prevent ailments or that there commercial maybe unintentionally teaching you how to be cool. If you did realize it is likely you are either: A. Chuck Klosterman B.  Simultaneously a sociologist focusing on media and a breakfast historian or C. person that has already read the book Sex, Drugs and Coco Puffs. 

Chuck Klosterman Is a writer for Spin and Esquire magazine. He is most prominently known for his work about classic rock bands but also has an almost infinite amount of cultural knowledge that makes SD&CP a very enjoyable collection of essays. Because of the fact that it is essays and not s story SD&CP should be a very easy book to pick up and put down, but I actually found it was not. His insights make him seem genius and the different perspectives he offers are as addictive as Cinnamon Toast Crutch.

Despite my plethora of cereal related references SD&CP is about far more then breakfast with themes that cover everything including The Real World, The Sims, Say Anything, and Vanilla Sky and few others that it is unlikely you could think of in your wildest dreams.

Usually The stories lack focus on the thing itself and look at a broader theme represented by the item, and while these are all only Mr. Klosterman's opinions even if you disagree they are very entertaining. The most common criticism of his work is his writing style that at sometimes seems intentionally overly wordy. I had no problem with it at, but I could defiantly see the potential for it to become annoying.

On the whole I found the book to be a very entertain and thought provoking, but would not recommended it to someone who wants a story but rather for someone who is interested in both reading random facts and learning to think differently."

Brideshead Revisited: The Sacred and Profane Memories of Captain Charles Ryder,0316926345,Evelyn Waugh,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"Charles Ryder is a character a lot of young people today (like myself) can relate his skeptisism, if not disdain, for the professed beliefs of his Catholic family. Through a series of relationships each slightly deeper than the last he ultimately seems to find that the object of his affection in any relationship will not quench some innate human desire and so it must be cast aside for a more difficult but deeply divine relationship with the God he so disdained. Interesting because in today's world as perpetual students we continuously question all aspects of life in search of sensibility rather than the sentimentality that Charles originally assumes faith to be.

It is beautifully written...the prose is of another time, when conversation was carefully considered. If you want your novels to have a conversational tone reflecting the 21st century, it is not for you.

The Everyman's Library books are beautifully made, fit wonderfully in one's hand, and are very affordable. I don't know about you, but I can't stand the feeling of a paperback (mass markets particularly)."

There isn't any other series that I've read yet that is worth 24 books to its name like this one. It stands out from the crowd and while may start out a little slow the first 25 or so pages, once it picks up speed it won't let you put it down.. simple as that. I stayed up til four in the morning finishing this book, and it was worth every minute. The characters are perfect, along with their flaws and personalities.

"White Night (The Dresden Files, #9)",0451461401,Jim Butcher,Barnes and Noble,4.7,brjunkie,"The best Dresden Files book since ""Summer Knight""!!! When helping Chicago's SI with a suicide, Harry finds that his brother, a vampire of the White Court is the prime suspect.  Working along side Murphy, their relationship is growing beyond that of just friends, but can Harry get over that she and Kencaid went to Hawaii?  Once a coven is found to be Thomas's next target, an old enemy of Harry's shows her face.  And, his old childhood friend and first love, Elaine is there to protect the witches of the coven.  The weight of being a warden is bearing down on him, along with teaching his apprentice, Molly.  Once again, with the aid of Marcone and Lasciel, Harry is able to uncover a threatening plot of the White Vampires."
"White Night (The Dresden Files, #9)",0451461401,Jim Butcher,Barnes and Noble,4.7,etimme on LibraryThing,"This has been my favorite of the Dresden Files books so far. Harry went to Warden boot camp to teach new recruits and in the time between books 8 and 9 he gained a lot of fighting prowess. His single silver telekinetic ring has been upgraded to four twisted bands of silver, he crafted a new charm bracelet, and he more readily uses both Lasciel and Hellfire in his magic. We saw what Wardens Morgan and Luccio were able to do at the end of Dead Beat - White Night brings us a Harry that's moving in the same direction.This book continues the thread of Harry being concerned for the isolation of the slightly-magical community, and we see a reemergence of two old villains and get a name put to the faceless threat that's been around since the first book - the Black Council.The end of the book leaves us with more questions than answers. Lasciel is presumably dead after sacrificing herself to save Harry's mind and life - can Harry still draw on Hellfire with the shadow gone from his mind? We still don't know who fixed little Chicago, and we also don't know who blew up Murphy's car. The Black Council is moving here, but there are other forces moving behind the scene to combat them. It's frustrating as a reader to see so many puzzle pieces but not being given any edge pieces.After 9 books I still don't know Butcher's mind. He doesn't readily kill off his characters, and overall the series has been moving towards Harry collecting allies - not losing them. Still, I think I'm going to call Ebenezar McCoy as being part of the Black Council. It would be fitting, I think, for the author to break Harry's progress and make him question more closely the friends he has accumulated through a more core betrayal by his master."

For those that DIDN'T read this book: SHAME on you for using this review site as a chat or pick up site . Authors depend on honest review and ratings! I see you using this as a way to ruin her &quot; real &quot; reviews!:( For the person that didn't know what the story was even about and gave it a low rating..... pick the book up and at the very least READ the synopsis. It may give you a clue! Then you may actually pick up and read it.  I'm just bad, that a few thoughtless people would do this.....please for all our sakes , Grow up! I shall be listing a more in depth review on Goode ads and other sites"
The Miniaturist,0062306812,Jessie Burton,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Sandy-thereadingcafe,"3.75 stars:  THE MINIATURIST is an historical fiction storyline set in seventeenth century Amsterdam. Told from close third person POV, this is the story of newlywed Nella Oortman &ndash;an eighteen year old young woman whose new and much older husband &ndash;merchant trader-Johannes Brandt is emotionally distant but not unkind. As the days blend into weeks Nella learns there are secrets within the Brandt household that will change her life forever. But a gift from her husband of a miniature replica of their home will begin to foretell of a dark and dangerous future. With each new miniature piece that arrives, Nella fears that someone is watching their every move.
The storyline follows a few months in the life of Petronella Oortman Brandt whose relationship with her husband is a matter of convenience. Left alone to her own devices, Nella begins to uncover family secrets hidden behind closed doors and secret rooms. Johannes reputation as a trader has garnered him a few loyal followers but it is his dalliances on the side that will see the beginning of the end. A negotiated promise of sales fails to produce the desired results and someone will seek revenge.

THE MINIATURIST is a storyline that is set in 1686 around the time of the sugar cane plantation exploitation and slavery in the British West Indies. As the Dutch begin to import the candied sweet the business of trading and selling is one of critical survival. Here in lies a part of the storyline where Johannes Brandt&rsquo;s personal and private life become fodder for public consumption-the politics and religion of the time will show no mercy.
Johanne&rsquo;s sister Marin plays a major role throughout the storyline but like Johanne she is emotionally distant and lacks any sort of literary color. Most of the household members remain static in their development but Johanne&rsquo;s one time friends will play a role in his downfall.  It is not until the end of the story that we get a glimpse into the Brandt family dynamics and the darker secrets that they share. 

THE MINIATURIST is a well written, dark and dramatic tale about family, betrayal, love and loss. It is a tragic look at life in the 1600s-from slavery to racism; judgment and religion; health, welfare and survival in a world where people have set themselves upon a pedestal of unreachable heights. The miniaturist is always in the background but never thoroughly explored-there are so many unanswered questions as to the who and why of the miniaturist&rsquo;s involvement in the story--for all intents and purposes another storyline is required to clear up some of the mystery and to acknowledge to what purpose the miniaturist played in their lives. There is a hint of the paranormal with the miniaturist&rsquo;s prophetic gifts."
"Dragons of Autumn Twilight  (Dragonlance: Chronicles, #1)",0786915749,"Margaret Weis, Tracy Hickman",Barnes and Noble,4.6,Guest,"Yes, it is sort of slow at first, but there is something in the book that makes you keep reading, and when you get to page 75 or so you cannot put it down! By page 200 it was straight to my top 10 list(maybe even 5). There is a little bit of love, extreme action, supense, danger, and twists and turns here and there. That silly kender Tasslehoff tips it off with humor. Slowly it builds up from some friends meeting to them fighting a Dragon Highlord! If you like swords, magic, love, humor, action, adventure, dragons and walking warrior skeletons, BUY THIS BOOK(at the very least read it)! I CAN GARANTEE YOU WILL NOT REGRET YOUR CHOICE!!!!! But all in all this book is undescribably one of the best books ever written."

"The Lost Colony (Artemis Fowl, #5)",0786849568,Eoin Colfer,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"This book is but another reason why the Artemis Fowl trilogy is favored by readers of all ages in the world.  Fostered around a great plot, this novel will keep you immersed in the intense and humorous storyline for hours.  However, I feel that this book is truly great because of its precise and colorful details.  These details paint a picture in your mind to the point where you're there, standing in some of the most luxurious and complex places in the world or right in the middle of a battle, watching rubble and bodies flying all over the place.  Destinations you've never even heard of will seem crystal clear through Colfer's fluent writing. As a person who enjoys reading fantasy novels, I thought that the cooperation between what's fictional and non-fictional really took this book to another level.  Instead of having different groups split to do separate objectives, Colfer is able to make them work together, thus eliminating the confusion between parties.  However, the best part of this book is the deep plot.  It keeps you guessing as it unfolds, each new event causing more clouding of what is really happening.  When you think you have grasped the causes for these bizarre events, Colfer throws you a curveball, and then it's back to square one again.  Although I would suggest this book to all readers who love fantasy books, I think that it is best suited for the younger generations.  Not much wordage is very challenging, and the humor in the book would be more appealing towards a younger audience.  Overall, I thought that this was a very fluent and well written book.  Although the language can be simple at times, the great details and deep plot will have you burning the late-night oil.  If you are looking for a book filled with details and humor, I would suggest this book without hesitation."
"The Lost Colony (Artemis Fowl, #5)",0786849568,Eoin Colfer,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Balina,totally aweseome! Read it & loved it
"The Lost Colony (Artemis Fowl, #5)",0786849568,Eoin Colfer,Barnes and Noble,4.5,TeensReadToo,"Artemis Fowl is back (finally)! I was terrified that my favorite Irish billionaire genius teenager was gone for good because author Eoin Colfer has been publishing a variety of books in the last couple of years that had nothing to do with good old Artemis. But, fortunately, the boy genius hasn't been forgotten. He's back and more brilliant than ever in this fifth installment of the high-tech fantasy series. As THE LOST COLONY opens, Artemis is fourteen years old and experiencing the uncomfortable pangs of puberty. While that alone is enough to keep most teens busy for a few years, Artemis has to contend with his surging hormones while trying to save an entire fairy race as it teeters on the brink of extinction. But it's that kind of multitasking that has made Artemis Fowl an international sensation. THE LOST COLONY has all the elements that Fowl fans have come to expect, including a dizzying array of fairy-issue gadgets, danger whizzing past our heroes from a variety of sources, ingenious plans, and a bodyguard who is as loyal as he is lethal. This book also includes a few new characters who were, for the most part, likeable and fun. The one notable exception is a twelve-year-old French girl who could give Artemis a run for his money in the genius category. She is pretty, rich, and highly annoying. I often found myself wishing that one of the other characters would ""accidentally"" dunk her in a sewer, or shave her head, or something equally unpleasant. Is it wrong for me to have feelings of aggression toward a fictional character? No, I don't think so. And you'll understand what I mean once you read the book. Fans of the ARTEMIS FOWL series will not be disappointed in this newest adventure. There were a few problems with the story, including some hard-to-follow descriptions of how Artemis and company escape their latest predicament, and an irritating French girl (see above). Overall, though, I found this an enjoyable book with an ending that knocked me for a loop. And, as always, I was left wondering what mischief Artemis will dream up next."
"Extras (Uglies, #4)",1416951172,Scott Westerfeld,Barnes and Noble,4.1,smokesignls,"After reading all about Tally, Shay and David for three books, I was left longing for more.  Extras had them to some degree, but not as much as I would have liked.  It successfully answered the ""what happens next"" question left hanging at the end of Specials, but I wasn't a fan of introducing a whole new cast of characters."
"Extras (Uglies, #4)",1416951172,Scott Westerfeld,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"People who like reading about adventures will without a doubt enjoy this book! The title is Extras and it is written by Scott Westerfeld.  The genre is teen adventure/science fiction. In Extras the reader is introduced to Aya Fuse, who is tired of being a nobody. After a party, she meets the Sly Girls, a group of brave girls who want nothing to do with fame, which is all Aya wants. Aya gets her chance when they discover something that could bring her fame but could put the rest of the world in danger. My opinion on Extras is that it's a very attention-grabbing book. From page one to the end, it had my complete interest. It is full of excitement and many people can relate to some things that happen in this book. So, if anyone is in for an adventure, read Extras!"
"Extras (Uglies, #4)",1416951172,Scott Westerfeld,Barnes and Noble,4.1,WordCandie,"I couldn't stop at Specials when I discovered there was a 4th installment in the series, but I was disappointed by most of this story. At first I was mostly just confused by the jump in time and the abandonment of Tally's story. I was really happy that she was reintroduced later in the story but this one fell flat for me overall. I would never have skipped it though, due to my dedication to the series as a whole. Don't expect the same excitement of Specials to be repeated in this story."
"The Burning Bridge (Ranger's Apprentice, #2)",0399244557,John Flanagan,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Dojin,"I just loved this book.  It was exciting, thrilling, and interesting from page one to the ending.  My favorite character is Halt although I adore Will and Horace.  Halt is a caring and good teacher.  He is patient with Will and supports his growth as an individual.  Will goes on simple mission with Gilan, who is Halt's former apprentice.  Only the simple mission turns out to be anything but complicated!!  There is a part in the story where Halt, who is in a bad mood, misses Will.  So he is assigned to escort Alyss on a diplomatic mission.  The interaction between these two characters is a delight to read.  The ending with the bridge is awesome and well worth reading the book.  I really enjoyed all the excitment.  Well done, Mr. Flanagan!!!!"

"The Book of Life (All Souls Trilogy, #3)",0670025593,Deborah Harkness,Barnes and Noble,4.4,crystalmmccabe,"*This review was a collaborative effort on behalf of Orchard Book Club* - Crystal McCabe

Orchard Book Club was lucky enough to receive an advanced copy of The Book of Life.  Both of us devoured it in about a day.  Fellow member Rachel will be adding her review after she reads it too so stay tuned for that.  Before we start, we think it&rsquo;s important that you know something about us (Tina &amp; Crystal).  

See, we met because of this series.  We were both on Twitter anxiously sending tweets to Deb Harkness over the release of Shadow of Night around two years ago and found each other.  It was an All Souls Trilogy match made in heaven.  Two super fans of the series who became instant online friends.  That being said, you must understand that we are both utterly devoted to this book and the entire series.  We seriously love it.  Everything about it.  The characters, Matthew, the writing, the plot, Matthew, the entire experience, and, most importantly, Matthew.  (Matthew is Crystal&rsquo;s absolute top book boyfriend ever.  And she reads &ndash; a lot!)  

Now, onto the review.  We pick up right where we left off with Matthew and Diana having arrived back from the past to Sept-Tours to see their combined family.  It&rsquo;s amazing how both families are so different but come together for the sake of Matthew and Diana and the greater overall picture of sacrifice and love.  And there is a much greater picture being painted that will reveal itself at the end.  There is great strength and solidarity shown by both families to be able to put aside their vast differences and beliefs in order to support Matthew and Diana and what they represent against not only the Congregation but also against all other enemies.  There are very noticeable differences at Sept-Tours since they arrived back, but everyone must strive to move forward and continue on the journey at hand.  There is not one soul, living or dead, that wants Matthew and Diana to give up on the journey that consumes them.  

Enemies and foes seem to be flying at the de Clermonts/Bishops at every turn in The Book of Life.  This brings to the forefront the quest to find the missing page of Ashmole 782 in order to attempt to unlock its secrets.  Everyone believes that if the book can be repaired by returning the three missing pages that it can explain, among other things like creature origins and blood rage in vampires, how Diana is able to carry Matthew&rsquo;s children.  After all, there is a paranormal romance going on in this series.  And we love the moments Matthew and Diana are able to steal away with each other.  Matthew&rsquo;s pet names for Diana of mon coeur and ma lionne are particularly heartwarming to us.  We just melt when he calls her mon coeur and fall a little more in love with him.  The struggles Matthew faces with being mated to Diana and his intense need to protect her and be near her are a challenge for them both in this book.  There even comes a time when they have to fight their battle separately on two different fronts in order to be able to meet in the middle in the end.  This is particularly difficult for both of them.  Matthew realizes what he must do in order to move forward and he struggles greatly with having to be apart from Diana.  However, there is also much understanding to be had about the great strength that Diana possesses as well during this time.  

Without giving anything away, a lot of past characters are more prevalent in this book.  Everyone has a purpose.  Some you love, some you hate, some you come to finally understand, and some you just want to strangle.  But we assure you that everyone has their purpose.  Deb writes each character so well and so deeply that you have no choice but love them all in the end because each one plays an integral part in the overall story.  We even get a better look into all things endearing and heart-rendering about Gallowglass (who was the favorite addition in Shadow of Night for both of us).  Some characters we thought we left back in Shadow of Night resurface as well.  Like we said, rest assured that EVERYONE has their purpose in this series.  

While the battle continues to rage, something beautiful happens.  Babies.  The scenes surrounding the twins were a particular favorite for us.  The dialogue makes you feel like you are in the room.  It&rsquo;s that strong.  With the addition of the two newest members of the Bishop-Clairmont clan we really feel how important it is to fight the Congregation and put the issues of the Covenant to rest once and for all.  That is the most pressing issue.  Finding out about Matthew&rsquo;s blood rage and the possibilities of it being passed on are a pressing second but with the team they have working on the genetics of it, rest assured that the matter is in good hands.  

We feel confident that everyone will agree in the end that no one saw what was coming.  We were both completely blind-sighted by some of the events that occur towards the end of the book.  We finally get to see Diana come into her own and become stronger than anyone thought she ever could.  We get to see Matthew take a few steps back and let her lead once in a while.  When this happens you really get a sense of how strong the power of love truly is.  It&rsquo;s not just about a witch and a vampire anymore.  It&rsquo;s not just about the difference in worlds.  It&rsquo;s about love and family and the importance of doing whatever you must to protect it.  

Deb just has a way of sending you into this magical world full of so much love, heartbreak, happiness, suspense, hatred, heartbreak, and utter and complete wonderfulness that you will forever be changed by her story.  We were!  The Book of Life ties the All Souls Trilogy up neatly into one of Diana&rsquo;s weaving knots.  Everything has its place and we don&rsquo;t think we could&rsquo;ve imagined a better ending to the story.   We are equal parts sad that it&rsquo;s over and extremely happy about the journey.  We became friends because of Deborah Harkness and her books so it seemed only fitting that we worked together on this review.  We very anxiously awaiting this book knowing it would be the conclusion of our favorite characters.  We will continue to reread the All Souls Trilogy whenever we are in need of a great book.  Matthew will remain Crystal&rsquo;s favorite book boyfriend (probably ever).  

In closing, we say &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; to Deborah Harkness for inviting us into her world of witches, vampires, and daemons.  We are forever changed by your words and we sincerely hope that you will continue to write more books.  To the readers, please trust us - you won&rsquo;t be sorry!"

The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,1585421464,Julia Cameron,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"Dreams: Our fond hopes and aspirations.  Dreams are born of crisis. Dreams are born of chance. Dreams are born of choice. The early to mid 1990's was an awful time for me an my family. Picture one bad thing crashing in on top of the other. 'Why God'?, I cried, more in despair,then anger. I was heartbroken.      THE ARTIST'S WAY is a guide on the journey to recapture and nourish the things of our youth; spontaneity, joy, adventurousness, and creativity. 'In a sense,' writes author Julia Cameron, ' our lives become our work of art.' If Cameron is correct,then I had allowed my work to reflect a life filled with 'crazymakers,' 'dream killers,' and codependece. I had lost sight of precious priorities. The atrophy of success had dulled my sense of possibility.    Using her own life illustrations, Julia Cameron presents a progression of exercises for a twelve week program to reclaim 'the creative self.' I recommend 'reading deprivation.' ('For most blocked creatives reading is an addiction.  We gobble the words of others rather than digest our own thoughts and feelings, rather than cook up something of our own.') I also recommend affirmations.(Put them in writing.)    Cameron calls THE ARTIST'S WAY her spiritual journey,'a pilgrimage home to the self.' It is for me."
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,1585421464,Julia Cameron,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"On Christmas of 1994 my husband gave me this book by my request.  I began The Artist's Way the next day and threw myself into the program lock, stock and barrel.  Now, all these years later, I can honestly say that this book was among one of my major influences in life. I not only became more aware of my creativity, I learned to be aware of times when I let it go lax, so that I can reclaim it.  There is never anything like the first time you go through the 12 weeks.  I tried to recreate the experience, but it is never as powerful.  I advise anyone doing this to do ALL the steps. Do not skip things like reading deprivation and the money issues because otherwise you will miss something you need to understand the larger process.  TAW has brought many wonderful things to my life, not the least gave me the courage to begin college at the age of 43. Now I am an English teacher and I love my career. One of the things colleagues always say is that I am creative.  It is a direct result of living the principles of this book.  It is never too late to find the creative life.  Don't just BUY this book -- take it for all its worth!"
The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,1585421464,Julia Cameron,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"This book is awesome! I re-connected with thoughts and dreams I'd either   forgotten or never knew I had.  The 'as a kid' exercise ( pg. 125) helps dredge up  some of those thoughts and dreams.  In the exercise, you complete several sentences.  For example, 'As a kid, I missed the chance to . . .' or 'As a kid, I lacked . . .' or 'As a kid, I dreamed of being . . . .' I discovered that I thought extreme snowboarding, jai alai, and poker are fun things I'd never do (page 87).  One of my favorite exercises was to list 20 things for 'If I didn't have to do it perfectly, I would   try. . .'  Tango lessons.  Surfing.  Flower arranging.  Wearing a kimono.  Writing a verse play.  This book asks you to make lots of lists--which I liked. From the 'five people you admire' to 'five favorite childhood foods' (pages 76-77).  Ovaltine rocks!!!  And so does this book."

Horns,0061147958,Joe Hill,Barnes and Noble,4,TDotts,"The title of Joe Hill's second novel encapsulates the problem facing its main character - Horns. Ignatius ""Ig"" Perrish wakes up after a hard night of drinking brought on by the one-year anniversary of his girlfriend's murder. He may not have his memories, but he does have horns. Actual, bony protuberances. A trip to the hospital finds the horns aren't the only unusual thing about Ig.

He has the ability to make people around him disclose their innermost thoughts, sinful fantasies and confessions of past and planned crimes. If he touches someone, he sees their sinful pasts. If he thinks about it, he can make them act on their worst desires.

The first people Ig listens in on confirm one of his worst fears. Everyone believes he's guilty of murdering and raping his girlfriend, Merrin. Even his parents who just wish Ig would go away. His brother, who hosts a late-night talk show, falls under the horns' spell and tells Ig who really murdered Merrin. And all of this happens in the first fifth of the book.

In a typical horror novel, Ig would embark on a quest to rid himself of the horns and seek justice. But Hill isn't a typical horror writer. Instead of rejecting the evil of the horns, Ig embraces it, finding it second nature to encourage people to act out their desires. Ig isn't a hero in the conventional sense of the word.

It could be hard to root for him to succeed - usually a reader cheers for the characters fighting the devil - but traditional good and evil don't apply here. Hill doesn't take a black-and-white view of the world in Horns; it's grey streaked with darks and lights. Perhaps the question underlying the novel's events is whether evil is necessary.

Where Hill hits his stride is in the extended flashbacks to younger versions of the main characters. The novel becomes a coming-of-age story where teenagers do stupid teenage things that create bonds between them lasting well into adulthood. The allure of cherry bombs sets off a chain of events that introduces Ig to Lee, who becomes his best friend and the third player in the Ig-Merrin relationship.

Lee has his own issues to deal with as an adult, and the clich&#233;s a lesser author might trot out never come to pass. The characters are complicated and fully realized. Even minor characters enter with a full history. The reader has the impression Hill knows all of his characters down to what brand of toothpaste they use. Hill's talented so he doesn't feel the need to put everything he knows down on the page. It's enough he knows and uses that knowledge to inform the choices the characters make.

The flashbacks can hold more attraction than the present-day pieces, but that may be because they tell the story of before Ig's life fell apart. As the horns become more important to who Ig is, the reader starts to look for signs Ig will find a way out, that good will prevail and innocence will take the day. These things happen . and they don't. Not all questions are answered by the last page. And the ones that are don't come with a nicely tied ribbon.

It's inevitable Horns will be compared with Hill's first novel, Heart-shaped Box. Whether one is better than the other is a matter of personal taste. The two novels are different, with Horns coming off as a little more fantastical and requiring a little more fantastical and requiring a little more suspension of disbelief. Regardless, Horns is an enjoyable read that leaves you anxious for another Joe Hill book."
Horns,0061147958,Joe Hill,Barnes and Noble,4,LadyHester,"At first I wasn't sure I like this book or the cast of characters. However, the more I read the more intrigued I became. This story is simply so original and unique that it stands alone in the horror genre. Joe Hill is a powerful writer and close to becoming one of my favorites. This book examines the evil in everyone, especially in those we love the most and we who think love us back."
Horns,0061147958,Joe Hill,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"First of all, I'd like to address those people who feel the need to tell the entire story line, paragragh after paragragh. STOP IT! It's annoying, boring, and ruins it for the rest of us. A review is supposed to be a paragraph or two describing WHY you did or did not like the book. With that being said, HORNS is one of the best books I've read in a while. Great characters, intetesting plot, and some surprising twists. Kept me interested the whole way through.  I will definitely be reading more from this author!"
Catherine the Great: Portrait of a Woman,0679456724,Robert K. Massie,Barnes and Noble,4,FeatheredQuillBookReviews,"Catherine II, Empress of all the Russians, is known as one of the most powerful and hard working people in history. Many writers and historians have not always been sympathetic to her regarding her private life and have overlooked her achievements when ruling Russia. In contrast, Mr. Massie has written a stellar biography of Catherine that tells the reader what an accomplished and remarkable woman she became. Catherine was born in Stettin, in 1729. Stettin was then Germany and is now Poland. Her father was Prince Christian Augustus of Anhalt-Zerbst, a prince of a lesser-known family among the many principalities in Germany. Her mother, Princess Johanna of Holstein-Gottorp, was much younger than the Prince but was from a much higher-ranked family. She was given the name: Sophia Augusta Frederika of Anhalt-Zerbst. After Sophia was born, her mother became bored with the provincial life of Stettin, where her husband was a high ranking officer in the Prussian Army. As Johanna was related to many noble families in Germany, she took every opportunity to travel to the courts of Zerbst, Hamburg, Brunswick, Kiel and even Berlin. Many years before this, Johanna's brother Prince Karl August of Holstein-Gottorp had gone to Russia to marry the Princess Elizabeth Petrovna, daughter of Peter the Great. Before the wedding took place, the Prince died of small pox, leaving Elizabeth heart-broken. Elizabeth's nephew, son of her sister Anna, came to St. Petersburg when his parents died at Elizabeth's behest and was named as the heir to the throne of Russia as his mother and Aunt were daughters of Peter the Great of Russia. In November of the year 1741, Princess Elizabeth seized the throne with the help of the Imperial Guards, formally declaring her nephew Peter Ulrich of Holstein-Gottorp the heir to the throne. When she brought him to St. Petersburg she changed his name to Grand Duke Peter Fedorovich, the future Tzar Peter III. Peter was now 14 years old and it was time to look for a bride for him. Elizabeth remembered fondly the family of Karl August, whom she had been engaged to marry and invited the Princess Johanna, sister of her deceased fiance and the Princess Sophia to come to St. Petersberg to meet the heir to the throne and plan a wedding between the two young people. Sophia's name was changed to Catherine II and she went on to marry the future Peter III. She was treated badly by Peter and looked for companionship elsewhere with young men of the court. Her favorite companion was Gregory Potempkin by whom, it was said, she had her child Paul, who became heir to the throne. While she was Empress, she dealt with the many trials and tribulations of her country and looked after the welfare of the Russian people. She was praised by many and, as usual, condemned by some - and the author has remarked on all of her triumphs and failures. Her family, friends, enemies, lovers, etc. are all told about in abundance, including her mother, forever making plans that made her look good, and her husband who had nothing to do with her, ignoring her most of the time. This story is grand and glorious as are Robert Massie's previous works: (Nicholas and Alexandra and Peter the Great: His Life and World). The story is accurate, the characters very true to life, with much style and detail. Quill Says: For readers of history, this is a gem. A life story of an extraordinary woman which is very rich in color and drama."
Catherine the Great: Portrait of a Woman,0679456724,Robert K. Massie,Barnes and Noble,4,The_Paperback_Pursuer,"Description:
          Catherine the Great: Portrait of a Woman by Robert K. Massie is the biography of Sophia Augusta, later known as Russian Empress Catherine the Great. It details Sophia's childhood, marriage, children, affairs, rise to power, famed coup, and eventual death. It is based on recorded historical documents and on Catherine's memoirs.

Review:
     I have never read any other books by Robert K. Massie, but now I'm hooked. Catherine the Great: Portrait of a Woman is one of the most well-researched and compelling biographies that I have read to-date. The history contained in its 600+ pages is phenomenal, and once I started reading I didn't want to stop. Not only was Catherine the Great a strong-willed, clever, and courageous leader, but an amazing woman who was years ahead of her time. The book was laid out in typical biographical format, birth to death, but Massie's mastery of description and detail put the book in another class entirely. I felt like I was reading a gripping fictional account of the empress as she ruled and fought for equality and preservation of the Russian state, instead of a dry biography filled with dates and facts. I was very impressed with the book's pace as well as the depiction of many famous figures, particularly Diderot, Gregory Potemkin, and d'Alembert. I wish I would have had this book handy for my European history class because I truly feel like I have a better understanding of Russia as a country as well as the politics of the time period. I recommend this to history-lovers, history / literature students, and anyone who wants to experience the awe and majesty of Catherine the Great!

Rating: On the Run (4.5/5)

"The Year of the Flood  (MaddAddam, #2)",0385528779,Margaret Atwood,Barnes and Noble,3.9,kren250,"Margaret Atwood's latest book The Year of the Flood is another of her dystopian offerings. It's many years in the future (Atwood never gives an exact date), and humans have finally managed to destroy much in the natural world. Many animal species are extinct, pollution is rampant, weather is out of control, and society is buckling down to live out the days the best they can. Into all this comes the ""waterless flood"", a disaster that has wiped out nearly all the humans in the world. At least two have survived: Toby, the manager of a high-end spa who has barricaded herself inside; and Ren, a dancer/prostitute who was in the ""sticky zone"" (a type of sick bay) when the disaster hit. Now, separately, the two have to try to survive in this strange new unpeopled world. Will they ever find each other? And, the bigger question: did anyone else survive? 

I really liked this book; it's not only a great read but very thought-provoking as well. The story is told with flashbacks to Ren and Toby's former lives, which added a lot to the book; it made an interesting contrast to see what things were like before the waterless flood. Toby is tough, smart, and resourceful; and it's always wonderful to see a strong female protaganist (one reason I love Atwood's books). I also thought Atwood did an excellent job of showing how bad things could possibly get on earth in the years to come, without being preachy about it. 

I did have two minor quibbles about the book, which is why I gave it four stars instead of five. The first was the annoyingly cute futuristic names many of the things are given: ""Anooyoo"", ""violet biolet"", ""SekSmart"", ""Mo'hairs"", ""Sea/H/Ear candy"", ""liobams"" (if names will really be this cheesy in the future than the world is indeed in trouble;-)!. Yes, it's a very minor thing, but for some reason it grated on my nerves a bit. The other quibble I can't say without giving away spoilers, but it has to do with some coincidences that happen towards the end of the book. I didn't find these coincidences to be very plausible. 

Minor quibbles non-withstanding, I could barely tear myself away from the pages of this book. I highly recommend it, especially if you like your sci-fi with a mix of great literature."
"The Year of the Flood  (MaddAddam, #2)",0385528779,Margaret Atwood,Barnes and Noble,3.9,book-a-holick,"I read Oryx and Crake and Year of the Flood back to back. I had really enjoyed Oryx and Crake, and expected Year of the Flood to be a smooth continuation of the first book, but it is not. I was about a fourth of the way through the second book before I realized and accepted, yea, embraced, the fact that Year of the Flood has a style and focus and engaging characters all its own. The two books should be read in order, but the reader must be open-minded when starting the second book, as it approaches the causes and aftermath of the pandemic (waterless flood) in a totally different but equally entertaining way. 
P.S. About half way through, I was thrilled to see a few of our 'friends' from Oryx and Crake cropping up!"
"The Year of the Flood  (MaddAddam, #2)",0385528779,Margaret Atwood,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"An apocalyptic tale drawing from current events--disease, food production, environmental degradation, socioeconomic segregation, corporate controls, religious fanaticism, etc., etc. Thought-provoking.

Winter Garden,0312364121,Kristin Hannah,Barnes and Noble,4.3,GrannnyJude,This was my first time reading Kristen Hannah and I was absolutely mesmerized by this story and the way she portrayed the characters. It was a heartwrenching story of a time in history that changed so many lives and gave us a picture of how it changed a family forever. I was not able to put the book down once I started it and was drawn into the intrigue of what the secret of Anya's life was and what had turned her so cold.  Kristen Hannah's storytelling in this novel give us a close decription of the connection between families and how love can prevail. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a great story and has time to curl up and enjoy this book.

Winter Garden,0312364121,Kristin Hannah,Barnes and Noble,4.3,retromom,Great book about two sisters who grow up thinking their mother hates them. When their father passes they promise him that they will take care of their mother and make her tell them a childhood fairy tale that she has kept to herself for many years. In doing so they learn who their mother is and much about the women they have become. A very heartwarming read. Kleenex necessary! I love Kristin Hannah's stories. They are always touching!

I picked it up recently and absolutely could not put it down. This book has touched me in so many ways. Admittingly, I have taken our liberties for granted. After reading this book, I am truly grateful for men such as Marcus who are willing to put their lives on the line in order to protect mine. The courage these men have cannot be denied. This book should be read by all. I read some of the recent reviews and took great offense on comments regarding the political slant. This book is not about that. Regardless of how you feel about war and the US involvment, one cannot be less than thankful for the protection we have by our military. This book is so very highly recommended. It will be hard to replace this book as my favorite!!!"

Anyway, I was searching this book to buy for a friend and I saw a negative review and thought I really should give my praises because this book is a must read.  It does an unbelievable job of weaving in lessons about hard work and determination, friendship, family, and the unwavering spirit of america. 

If it were up to me, this would be assigned reading for every high school senior- my generation could really take away so much from the experiences shared in this book.

Oh-- and to the person who claimed this book was written by an author who just continuously 'patted himself on the back', you become a navy seal and do multiple tours in iraq and afghanistan and tell me he doesn't deserve the credit he gives himself. He truly is an American hero. Five stars does not give this book nearly enough justice."

I absolutely LOVE this book!  My husband is a Marine, so I read a lot of military books.  This one is, by far, my favorite!  In it, Marcus Luttrell tells the story of growing up in Texas with his twin brother, the process of becoming a SEAL, and then his AMAZING story of survival against all odds!  EVERYONE should read this book!  Whether you're for the war, against the war, military, civilian, young or old.  It will open your eyes to a whole other world.  A world far, far away, yet so close to so many of our lives.  And one I find many Americans know very little about!"
"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd (Hercule Poirot, #4)",1579126278,Agatha Christie,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"This was my first real mystery book and I read it only for a school project. I had assumed it would be a real chore to read but I loved it. The beginning was really boring but after awhile I got really into it. When the ending came I had no idea, no idea. I had assumed the killer would be fairly obvious and I had my theory but the conclusion really caught me by surprise. The ending really made the story. And I'd definitely read it again even without the urging of a teacher."
"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd (Hercule Poirot, #4)",1579126278,Agatha Christie,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Njkinny,"A case unlike any other, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is a mystery in the class of mysteries where the concept is so novel that it will shock you and surprise you, leaving you with your mouth hanging open even though decades have passed since its publication! Howsoever, I tried I could not come up with one clear suspect. Agatha Christie expertly shifts her focus of suspicions from one character to another leaving the reader with no clue as to the real murderer. I tried all my &quot;little grey cells&quot; but could not pin point the murderer and when the killer was finally introduced I felt as if I had been punched so hard that no air was left in my lungs! This is one book that can be reread any number of times and it will entertain and shock us each time. An ageless and a gem from a legendary author, I give The Murder of Roger Ackroyda full shining 5 stars out of 5 and very highly recommend that you read this amazing mystery. A must read for everyone and a deserving &quot;must have&quot; for every avid reader. Read the complete review on blog Njkinny's World of Books.."

I think I could read it again and I still wouldn't be able to figure out the ending!  I've never read anything like it.  Ever since I read it I've been reading every Agatha Christie book I can get my hands on, and I have yet to be able to guess the ending.  It's almost scary all the different ways she can think up to kill someone!"
Native Son,006083756X,Richard Wright,Barnes and Noble,4.3,DeDeFlowers,"I am one to shy away from books about race. A lot of times I find it hard to relate or I find them to be boring or too graphic. I read this book because it was on a list of the 100 best books ever written and it is my goal to read them all to check out the hype. I really did not want to read Native Son.
From the first sentence of the first page I knew this was going to be something special. Wright's writing is captivating and the characters he builds are so real. Even if you cannot relate to this book personally, you will be able to relate to the emotions the main character Bigger Thomas is feeling. It is an amazing thing to be engrossed so deeply into a book as I was with this one. The plot is unique, especially as far as books about race go. Surprisingly this is also a very fast read. For a couple reasons: you cannot put it down and it is written very matter-of-fact. 
I can see why kids in high school might not want to read this. It's long and seems out of date. To be honest it might even go over a lot of the heads in a regular English class. I feel like this novel is for anyone though. It's important. This book is on my list of best books ever...which only had 11 books prior. That is a big deal! Read it :)"
Native Son,006083756X,Richard Wright,Barnes and Noble,4.3,bluetulip18,"Along with Invisible Man, Native Son is another powerful story that has schooled me on what W.E.B. Du Bois might have meant by ""double consciouness"": African Americans' tendency to see themselves through the eyes of others. Bigger, the main character, judges himself by society's stereotypes, and a profound fear of whites drives his every action (including a heinous crime so vividly described I had to put the book down for awhile). It's mind-boggling and tragic to think how much a person can truly become what society expects and assumes he'll be. Difficult story to swallow; an emotional, memorable read."
Native Son,006083756X,Richard Wright,Barnes and Noble,4.3,ECooper-Columbus,"Richard Wright¿s depiction on race relations in the 1940's was parallel to the thinking of most Black and White Americans today. We saw that with the newly elected president. I found this book a much needed read, not to conjure up racial tension but as a reminder of how we, Black and White Americans need to continue to strive for racial equality. He talked about how the price of food is higher in one section than another, how redlining occured than, which is another parallel of today¿s housing market. I, as a teacher, will use this book as a teaching tool to inspire my children to release pinned up anger by talking to an adult or someone they trust; use Bigger's lack of education to inspire them to stay in school. There are so many teaching tools that you can be pulled from this book and used as inspiration. The relevance of this book is still very useful today. It is a great read, I couldn't put it down."
"Shadow's Edge (Night Angel, #2)",0316033650,Brent Weeks,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,This bookk is one of the best books I have ever read. It  excellently follows the first book in the trilogy (way of shadows). The book also sets you up for the last book. For an excellent read that has great magic and superb martial arts and tremendous plot you can not go wrong with Brent Weeks.
"Shadow's Edge (Night Angel, #2)",0316033650,Brent Weeks,Barnes and Noble,4.6,readafew on LibraryThing,"This book was a wild ride.  A lot happens.  Our 'hero' has a lot of growing up to do and he isn't given a choice in the matter.  He tries hard to live the quite life but trouble seems to seek him out. It doesn't hurt that he doesn't try hiding very hard either.  Logan is put through an incredible crucible of his own and he came out much stronger for it.  Several of the other characters had plenty of their own trials, none of them easy.Weeks is brutal to his characters to say the least.  I have to admit that in the middle of the book things were almost getting to be too much and I was having a hard time reading.  Then things seemed to break loose and all the bad things were at least more balanced with some good things moving everyone forward.  While it wasn't a happily ever after (and I don't think anyone expected that at any time) it at least leaves you feeling some hope for the future and that there is still a chance that things will turn out better than they started.In many books, especially fantasy,  you have a pretty good idea that many of the 'good guys' will make it the end and have a happily ever after.  Not with The Night Angel, you suspect at least one or two will make it to the end and have a satisfactory ending.  I am eagerly awaiting my chance to finish the trilogy to see what happens."
"Shadow's Edge (Night Angel, #2)",0316033650,Brent Weeks,Barnes and Noble,4.6,crazybatcow on LibraryThing,"I really like the story, and the suspense, and most of the characters and their relationships... that being said... Eline bugged me with her holier than thou attitude and her ""love"" that was so powerful, but only - of course - as long as Kylar changed his behavior to match what she thought he should be. There were a lot more ""character development"" scenes in this book than in the first - i.e there was a chapter dedicated to Eline's moralizing, Vi's life, and Dorion's insanity. Oh, and Kylar's moping about how he has to choose between ""love"" and everything else he knows and wants. Once I skimmed through these long passages, however, the story kept me reading. So many things that I wanted resolved: the GodKing, the Night Angel, the witches, Vi, Logan... actually, I liked every plot thread except the very long segment where Kylar passed time trying to be a house-husband to a woman who only loves him if he acts how she wants him to. Once this section ended, however, the story carried on without further delays... which makes me wonder if the author had this section here in order to show how Kylar spent the 3 months between the coup and the commencement of this story's plot and it wasn't really intended as part of this story's plotting? that makes more sense.Overall, it's a satisfying story - full of angst, judgement, retribution and justice..."
"Under the Never Sky (Under the Never Sky, #1)",1907411054,Veronica Rossi,Barnes and Noble,4.5,AcesMommy,"Under The Never Sky is the BEST opener to the coming New Year!! It renders you speechless in how great it is! I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!
Right from the very first pages you will know that you would have to cancel your daily chores and activities and cuddle up to this book. Because it will grab your attention from start to finish! Expect sleepless nights!
Aria is a character that you can easily find yourself wanting to be friends with. At first you'd think she's nothing more than a sheltered brat wanting her mother, but as she goes through her journey to seek the truth and in finding her mom she tremendously matures right before your eyes. 
I enjoyed that in the beginning Perry was repulsed by Aria; not only in her actions but by her smell. That was hilarious when I first read it. It's great when the leading male doesn't fall for the leading gal right away. I also loved how blunt Perry was with his words even though he doesn't say much. He never held back in fear of hurting her feelings, and Aria would just take it without sulking.
The story is told in the point of views of Aria and Perry. They go hand in hand in telling their part in their journey. Never missing a step from each other and not having you skip a beat on what's going on. Veronica Rossi has done a fine job in getting you in the mindset of 'Under The Never Sky'. I cried when it came to it, and I screamed at characters I wanted beaten. The descriptions of the 'PODS', Aether, surroundings, and just everything wasn't lacking or overly done. There was balance, and I guess that's what made me enjoy the story a lot. 
The ending is such a TEASE!! When I got to the last page my heart sunk. I can't believe it is just coming into release! I don't know how I can hold over till Book #2 =)
Under The Never Sky by Veronica Rossi is a MUST READ DEBUT!! A definite 2012 favorite!!"
"Under the Never Sky (Under the Never Sky, #1)",1907411054,Veronica Rossi,Barnes and Noble,4.5,erinleighh,"After reading The Hunger Games trilogy I was looking for something just as gritty with the underlying romantic element that I crave. Amazon recommended this book to me to fill the Hunger Games void...but now I'm finding that I need something to fill the chasm that Under the Never Sky left! The characters were likable and had real flaws that they had to work out. The relationships were heartfelt and believable, and I could not get enough of the love game between the leads. As for the writing, it was beautifully crafted between the two perspectives and it was cleverly handled so there was minimal overlap and absolutely zero gaps. All in all, this was an exciting adventure and I cannot wait for the second book!!"
"Under the Never Sky (Under the Never Sky, #1)",1907411054,Veronica Rossi,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Buried-in-Books,"Characters- I like Aria from the start. She was determined to get answers from people who might have them so she used her singing abilities to her advantage. When things went awry, she took charge and tried to find a way out. When she has to tell her story, she does, even though it may condemn her. And when she finds herself alone outside of the safety of Reverie, she doesn't sit down and have a pity fest. I would have the biggest sob fest ever and wait to die. But she gets up and looks for a way back to where she thinks she can find her mother. I like this character very much! I like Perry as much as I like Aria. He's not nice to her, but that's not really his way. Being nice is not a survival skill and that's what it takes to live outside. He takes Aria's insults really well when I'm sure he'd like to backhand her. And he has a slow growing admiration for her which is well deserved. He makes no allowances for her, makes her keep up, but he also feeds her and clothes her. It's more than I would do for the enemy. The Writing and Storyline- The story is told with one chapter narrated in Aria's point of view and the other Perry's. I loved it being written this way. I love knowing what's going on in both characters minds instead of having to guess what the other character is thinking and feeling. It makes me feel more a part of the story. I got so involved with this one I had to read it straight through. The writing is neither spare nor overly descriptive but perfect for each scene or character. Each word was chosen carefully, even the names Aria, who has a singing voice like an opera diva and Perry or Peregrine who has the sight and smell of a master hunter, the falcon. Reverie was like a dream land, unrealistic in that you couldn't feel, didn't even touch. Touch was so foreign to Aria that she was repulsed by it, even from her mother. I loved this story, this coming from a reader that says she doesn't like dystopians. I'll have to change my opinion as this and other stories have proven me wrong. Under the Never Sky was like nothing I've read before. The world was brutal, yet softened by the love between Aria and Perry, which only happened maybe in the last third of the book. But they took care of each other, helped each other and their feelings grew slowly over time. I guess I fell in love with the characters, individually and as a couple. Aria is strong, never helpless, yet doesn't refuse help when offered. Perry is confused by his feelings, but follows through on them, he doesn't deny them, he even cries and is thought none the less for it by Aria."

"True Believer (Jeremy Marsh & Lexie Darnell, #1)",044669651X,Nicholas Sparks,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"The PW description seduced me into thinking it was a story about journalist investigating mysterious lights. It isn't. The lights serve only to get Our Hero to the place where he meets cliched smart beautiful librarian, so that he can ultimately embrace the charms of rural life.




Now, just about every romance formula is done over and over, and if it is done well, I enjoy it over and over. I did not think this was done well. The characters were all surface; there was no apparent reason for Hero to fall for this particular woman or she for him (except that pickings are slim in a very small town). And it struck me as being purely anti-modernist/technological -- a tiny backwater town equated with all that is good.This is a delightful novel. I liked the setting, because it is an area of NC I know quite well. As with many of Sparks' novels, any twists or turns in the plot are resolved, usually positively. Reading about good things vs action and killing is refreshing.It seems every book I read gets better and better. I love anything and everything that Nicholas Sparks comes out with.

Being a designer and business owner, I am often given quite a few entrepreneurial titles as gifts. And sadly, most of them don't do much for me, in terms of advice and information I can put to use in my fashion design business. Eric Ries', The Lean Startup is a major exception to this however! 

I found so much useful info in this book that it made me feel like Ries may be one of the few business writers who actually ""gets it"" when it comes to being an entrepreneur. I've read probably eight books this year, and only The Lean Startup and Wisdom & Wisecracks For The Aspiring Business Owner (also available on Barnes & Noble now) by Will Estell have made me feel like authors of these type books could have been  business owners themselves and get the issues that the rest of us face daily.

"The Golden Lily (Bloodlines, #2)",1595143181,Richelle Mead,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,I read the first book and just fell in love with it. It left me wanting more. Richelle Mead just writes in a way that will keep you wanting more. I read the Vampire Academy series and fell in love with it. And now this series is another one if hers that keeps me wantin more.
"The Golden Lily (Bloodlines, #2)",1595143181,Richelle Mead,Barnes and Noble,4.6,kirstin913,"This is &ndash; hands down &ndash; my new favorite book of 2012! My only complaint about Golden Lily is that it caused me to lose sleep. I finished this book in one day&hellip;and what an emotional day that was!

Normally I would write a little synopsis of the book, but not this time. Richelle Mead&rsquo;s work speaks for itself. If you&rsquo;re considering this book, chances are you&rsquo;ve probably not only read Bloodlines, but also the entire Vampire Academy series; if you haven&rsquo;t&hellip;then welcome to the Richelle fan club. With that said I&rsquo;m just going to write a few little tidbits about some of the character development within this second installment of the Bloodlines series.

Richelle Mead leads us back to Palm Springs and back into the lives of Jill, Eddie, Sydney, Adrian, and Angeline. We also see more appearances from Dmitri and Sonya Karp than we did in Bloodlines. 

Sydney goes through a lot of personal and emotional growth in this sequel. She not only learns more about the real history of Alchemists, but she also starts to realize that she has more loyalty and tolerance for the Moroi and Dhampir races&hellip;and that scares her because she doesn&rsquo;t want that info to get back to the Alchemists because they would send her to the re-education center (which she is terrified of). The prejudice that her upbringing taught her (both from her father and the Alchemists) is very hard for her to overcome and she battles with it every day. The decisions that she makes along her journey in this book will make you&hellip;. (Nope, not going to give spoilers, it&rsquo;s MUCH better to not know what&rsquo;s going to happen &ndash; trust me, it will be worth the wait.)

And let us not forget about the sexy, and ever-inebriated, Adrian. For anyone who fell in love with Adrian during the Vampire Academy series (or even if you just discovered him in Bloodlines), be prepared to completely swoon over him yet again. We&rsquo;ve all adored this sexy man who seems like he&rsquo;s in a constant battle with his mental health (thanks to his spirit magic), but in this book Adrian takes it to an all new level. I won&rsquo;t give more details and spoil the plots twists &amp; turns, but just know that hiding his feelings behind his sardonic quips and his constant smoking and drinking just isn&rsquo;t going to cut it this time.

Buy Golden Lily and get lost in between the pages. I will definitely be reading this book a couple more times before Bloodlines #3: The Indigo Spell comes out on February 12, 2013!!!"

Even if you are searching simply for a quick plane read (as I was), there has to be something better out there. Perhaps re-read one of her earlier works, or a book by another author that she plugs early in the book. The characters are unoriginal, the plot is the same rehashed ""sex in the city"" like story except these three ladies lack the charm that made SITC a great series. I do not recommend this book."

The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany,0671728687,William L. Shirer,Barnes and Noble,4.4,KBP,The Nook version of this great books IS NOT the 50th anniversary edition as pictured and advertised. It is the Rosetta Books version of a couple of years ago. It does not have the new forward by Ron Rosenbaum nor any of the other additional content.
The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany,0671728687,William L. Shirer,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Azpooldude,"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, by William Shirer, is without question The, most informative, well written account of the years from Hitler's birth until the end of World War Two in May of 1945, that I have ever read. This is the ""Grand-Daddy"" of them all, a must read for those interested in learning about this unforgettable time is world history. First released in 1959, this book is still readily available, half a century later, in all major book stores. A massive book, my paperback copy is 1,596 pages,(some of this books chapter's would be the subject of whole books written by other authors)is a surprisingly very fast read. Many have commented that it was so interesting, they could not put it down. Others have said that they read it straight through-I can see why.
Starting from the birth of Adolph Hitler, until the end of the Third Reich, William Shirer shares his actual experiences during the years, 1934-1940, where he was an American correspondent for CBS News and was regarded as one of the most respected U.S. journalist in wartime Europe. We are treated to first hand accounts of life in the Nazis Germany by Mr. Shirer, who had the opportunity to meet with many of the Hitler's inner circle, to include Goering and Dr. Goebbels, attended the Nazis rallies in Nuremberg and was present during many important events. He also was the reporter to scoop the French surrender to the Nazis in 1940. Besides living in Europe, Mr. Shirer offers numerous footnotes, personal journal entries from Hitler's generals and actual testimonies from the Nuremberg War Trails in 1946, that add incredible historical facts to the book. Much of the material was captured by the Allies after the war and made available to archivist and researchers.
Of interest is how William Shirer managed to smuggle out his notes and papers, as he fled Nazi Germany during the hight of the war to return home to America, is a story in itself. In the book, the Nazis rise to power, and all its key players, the appeasement of Neville Chamberlain, and Hitler's lies to annex Czechoslovakia and other countries leading up to the beginning of the war are explained to the fullest.  How the United Stated got involved in the war and Hitler's use of Mussolini and Japan are quite astonishing. Everything about the war is covered, from Russia to the Baltic, to the war in the Atlantic to North Africa and how the fast moving German Army was finally slowed down and eventually stopped. Be warned that many of the Nazis atrocities are explained in detail to complete the full picture of this horrid nightmare in human history.
The later part of the book gives the final account of the Reich and how its lunatic dictator and his loyal followers, still thought that the war could be won. Unknown to many is that when the Nazis realized that the war was lost, they thought they could enter into a pact with the West to defeat the hated Russians, unaware that the Allies had already agreed amongst themselves that an unconditional surrender was the only way to end the war. The final days and collapse of the Third Reich, the death of Hitler and his henchmen, is well documented as well.
There is too much to comment on in a short review, but this book deserves a place on every bookshelf.  A shocking story, that needs to be told and retold over and over ,hence history should not repeat itself. The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is a true classic.

The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany,0671728687,William L. Shirer,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Blackville,"I'm not a fast reader and I dove into the nearly 1,200-page tome with the understanding that I would probably devote the next month or two to the quest of gaining a much fuller understanding of Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany.  

I thought it would be worth the effort and I was right.  William Shirer's engrossing narrative provides a virtual ""everything you ever wanted to know"" about the Third Reich from the vantage point of someone who was actually there!  

A few reviewers have carped about his tendancy toward journalistic license at the expense of academic research, but I was able to overlook this in much the same way that I got past the same criticisms while reading Shelby Foote's wonderful three-volume account of The Civil War.  Dry historic research is okay for dry historic researchers.  

But, most popular writers are going to have some sort of bias, and Shirer can't avoid his need to remind us that frequently the Nazis were really BAD people and did really BAD things.  This I do not mind .. I appreciate it in fact."
A Long Way Down,1594481938,Nick Hornby,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Guest,"Ok...I waited a long time for this book, and i was somewhat dissappointed. Don't get me wrong, Nick Hornby is a great author, i love all his other books, but this one wasn't what i thought it would be.It started out great but....it kind of lingered down at the end. Maybe my expectations were high when i was reading it, of course it had some pretty funny but dark moments, but i would not recommend this book for newcomers to Nick Hornby."
A Long Way Down,1594481938,Nick Hornby,Barnes and Noble,3.5,hutchers,"I have seen Hornby's movies and have thoroughly enjoyed them so I thought I would try one of his Novels. Sadly, I was disappointed. I, at first, was entertained by the odd nature of the characters and the plot, but quickly became bored and annoyed with both. I think his attempts to be original were successful and his diction was easy to read but as the story itself progressed I began to resent the book. He may have achieved a well worded book, but the actual plot and story were unreliable and somewhat boring. 

There were positive parts to the book, Hornby's use of humor and allusions to pop culture helped move the book along and he easily portrayed selfish and flawed characters, but I was unable to find a connection, relate to or even like any of these characters. I was hoping for a meaningful ending, perhaps even an epiphany for the characters, but once again I found myself disappointed. For me, even though they may have suffered slight change the characters were stagnant. I saw little change in this novel and I think despite his efforts to create a realistic and relatable work, Hornby fell flat."
A Long Way Down,1594481938,Nick Hornby,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Anonymous,I thought the book would be more riveting. Hoping the movie is better...
"Out from Boneville (Bone, #1)",0439706408,"Jeff Smith, Steve Hamaker",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"First, a note to parents: many of you have been saying that there is material in this book that is not appropriate for children. In many interviews the author has addressed this say that while he did not write Bone for a children's audience (the comic books were originally released in black and white starting in the 90's) he says that the comics do not promote smoking and drinking. Neither Thorn or Phone Bone, the main characters partake in either activity. Plus none of the characters are seen getting drunk. I find it hard to believe that a child does not see people smoking on the sidewalk or people having a beer or glass of wine with their dinner. If it makes you more comfortable I would encourage you to read the stories with your child and explain to them that like in the comic, these activities are only for adults. Anyway, moving on.

REVIEW: 
Bone was the first graphic novel I ever read and I was floored. Expecting a light, funny story I found myself caught in what exploded into an epic fantasy. Well told, and though it is, like the author says, Tolkien crossed with Bugs Bunny, the story is very original. When the color editions came out I introduced them to my brother who was struggling with reading, and he was hooked. These graphic novels, comics, books, whatever you want to call them are definitely a great way to get kids to start reading, and are an intriguing adventure for readers of all ages."
"Out from Boneville (Bone, #1)",0439706408,"Jeff Smith, Steve Hamaker",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Bolf,"What seems like a book for younger population in the first three books, gets a lot darker after book four. So don't mistake it for a children's book. It's filled with so much humor, mystery, losses and surprises it's unbelievable. Characters are incredibly lovable. I first read it in 2006, and it was my favorite comic book since then. It still feels the same reading it now as it did back then. Recommended to people of every age group."

"Die Trying (Jack Reacher, #2)",0515142247,Lee Child,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,Die Trying was an incredible book. One of my favorite Lee Child books so far. I have read most of his books but I especially liked the theme that he used for this book. It starts out in typical Lee Child fashion when Jack Reacher finds himself swept into some kind of mischeif. In this book though the bad guys are a malitia group that want to turn the state of Montana into their own country. As always Lee Child adds lots of action and twists and turns. Who can he trust? One particularly tense part of the book involved crawling through a small tunnel in the middle of a mountain with a small flashlight that of course dies so that he is left in the dark and the tunnel narrows till he is stuck! Great book and I highly recommend it!!
"Die Trying (Jack Reacher, #2)",0515142247,Lee Child,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"This was one book I really didn't want to put down. (and that's saying a great deal for me) Jack is the man!, the writing was thrilling, a movie for the mind. I'm going to pick up 'Tripwire' tomorrow"
"Die Trying (Jack Reacher, #2)",0515142247,Lee Child,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Hiredoutlaw,"I started this book with little in mind. I had read Killing Floor a week prior to this and in my mind I had an idea of what the second novel would hold within. A light-read with a heavy romance between the main character and a broad he meets. Boy, was I wrong about this installment.  Mr. Child follows up with a story that takes some getting used to and understanding but soon enough you can't put it down.  You HAVE to know what will happen to Jack.Basically, the book starts off fast.  Reacher (the main character) is helping Holly, an FBI agent located in Chicago.  She hurt her leg and carrying her laundry out from the laundromat has proved more troublesome than ever.  Reacher lends a hand and shares the butt of a gun in his gut from a mysterious man who forces both of them into a car that speeds away from Chicago.  Reacher has just been the victim of the old proverb: ""wrong place at the wrong time.""  Only, Reacher soon realizes Holly is not just your ordinary FBI agent.The first 100 pages or so are very interesting. They speed by fast as you you need to know what happens.  Reacher causes an epic fight in the first 100 pages or so and you are locked in.  However, it starts to drag when the two of them are finally prisoners at a militia camp in Montana.  It got to a point where I was questioning myself. ""Should I stop?"" It wasn't leading anywhere and frankly, I was a tad bored.  I had other books on my mind.I decided to keep reading and I am glad I did. The book picks up and the last 100 pages are so thrilling and so suspenseful, you can't help but keep the book plastered in front of you.  It finally finishes in a ""bang"" and ends almost abruptly leaving you hungry for more.  The mysteries within the book are surprising however I was picking up on some clues in the beginning and analyzed them to conclude the mysteries and on some I was right and others wrong.  In a way, the end of the novel also leaves you a little shocked as the question ""Who is it?"" is finally answered.I'll be picking up Mr. Child's next installment soon.  Die Trying was an amazing sophomore attempt and is showing bright things for this author's future.  And judging from his large array of installments in this series currently, I'd say Mr. Child will be writing Reacher novels for a long time to come."
"Beautiful Chaos (Caster Chronicles, #3)",0316123528,"Kami Garcia, Margaret Stohl, Paz Pruneda",Barnes and Noble,4.5,BubblesCO,I have all the other books on my Nook. I'd like to keep my series in the same format! PLEASE!!! I am actually re-reading the series to get ready for the new one. I love this series. There is always something going on and it's never boring. If you love the supernatural and love stories make sure to read this series!
"Beautiful Chaos (Caster Chronicles, #3)",0316123528,"Kami Garcia, Margaret Stohl, Paz Pruneda",Barnes and Noble,4.5,BooksWithBite,"I admit that this book completely took me by surprise. As the reader, I was expecting so many others things but never that. I loved that this book took a whole new spin on love and sacrifice!

What I loved most about this book is the great plot line. So much going on in the book that is kept the reader hooked and always sated. Never once did my eyes stray from the pages as I devoured it. I enjoyed that while the plot line is unraveling secrets, poems, and love popped up where I never saw it.  Both authors once again did an amazing job on capturing the essence of the town and the characters!

The characters development in the story is where it needs to be. So much had changed in them that you know that these characters are at their peak. I enjoyed reading along with the characters in discovering secrets that have been under their noses. The book title is great for whats goes on in the book. Chaos. Total Chaos!

Now for the ending. Did I see that coming? No. It was something that left me gasping and WOWed. I won't spoil it, but yeah. Amazing ending that left me wanting more.

Beautiful Chaos is a completion of wonderful literature that had me in awe! I felt like I was in the town of Gatlin as soon as I open the first page, fighting the chaotic events unfolding between the pages. Filled with a great adventure of love and sacrifice, Beautiful Chaos will undo your mind leaving you yearning for more of Gatlin."
"Beautiful Chaos (Caster Chronicles, #3)",0316123528,"Kami Garcia, Margaret Stohl, Paz Pruneda",Barnes and Noble,4.5,EmoKitty,"Beautiful Chaos is a book mixed with love, suspense, and sacrifice. It is the third book in the Caster Chronicles. In my opinion, Beautiful Chaos is better than the first and second- Beautiful Creatures and Beautiful Darkness- combined. Yes, the first two were very good, but Beautiful Chaos has more drama. Instead of focusing on Lena¿s problems, it focuses on Ethan¿s. Since Ethan is the narrator, you can really get inside his mind and actually feel what he feels.
In the third installment of the Caster Chronicles, both worlds - the Caster and Mortal- go bad. Lena¿s Claiming- both Dark and Light- has messed up the Order of Things. Ethan is losing more of himself every day; Amma is acting Dark; and Ridley is suddenly casting spells again, yet she is Mortal. Throughout the novel, Amma is very secretive and we realize that she knows what the Wheel of Fate wants to be able to fix The Order: a sacrifice of The One Who is Two.This book kept me reading chapter after chapter. I never glanced up from it. The drama and suspense all comes together in the biggest and greatest finale I¿ve ever read. The ending definitely shocked me. And, I¿ll admit, I cried while reading the last chapter. It was a huge cliffhanger, and it makes the reader wanting to know the release of the next, and final, book.
	What I loved about this book is that Lena and Ethan know that life is short now; every moment could be their last. Ethan is so sweet to Lena; it made me teary-eyed reading what he says about her: ¿That when she looked at me, it was like there was no one else in the world. That when I looked at her, I noticed every detail about her while everything else faded away. That I was only myself when we were together.¿
I was overall satisfied with this book; never mind the heartbreaking, jaw dropping, tear jerking, ending. I still can¿t believe what Stohl and Garcia did to all the readers; it was like a kick in the throat. However, the purpose was achieved: I want to keep reading and I need to know if everything turns out happy."

"Cabin Fever (Diary of a Wimpy Kid, #6)",1419702238,Jeff Kinney,Barnes and Noble,4.3,GratefulMomCO,"Our son hates to read, but he is so excited about a new Wimpy Kid book coming out that he wants to pre-order it.  We have to make sure to buy the book on a weekend because he can't put it down once he has it. The Wimpy Kid books also help teach our son about social interaction and humor.  It is a wonderful way for him to learn about adolescent life.  The Wimpy Kid series also gives him something talk about with other kids because everyone we know is reading this series.  Jeff Kinney doesn't pull any punches in trying to make his main character some heroic angel. The reason all of this is so important to us is because our son has autism. To see our son smile and laugh out loud while reading a Wimpy Kid book is worth everything.  A huge thank you to Jeff Kinney.  We appreciate your books more than words can express!"

Everyone Worth Knowing,1416543007,Lauren Weisberger,Barnes and Noble,3.9,NativeRoses on LibraryThing,"This is a fun, silly book about Bette Robinson, a young woman who walks away from her grind of an analyst job at a major nyc investment bank.  She slacks and hangs out for awhile, before she scores another job in PR and enters the sleek world of all-night parties, fame, power, tastemakers, debuttantes, and celebrity babysitting.  Like all the other books in this genre, Bette ignores her better balanced friends and family, to pursue her whirl of a job and claw her way up the social ladder.Naturally, an epiphany follows.  And so forth . . . The plot is dull as mud.  What makes the book fun to read is the insider's view of the decadence of this social milieu as well as the view into the psyches of the individuals caught up in this world."
The Communist Manifesto,0140447571,"Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Gareth Stedman Jones",Barnes and Noble,3.5,Anonymous,"For those people who are confused by communism or opposed to it, I highly encourage you to read this remarkable text to understand what it is. Many people still debate about how ""communism"" has been practiced in the world and how it has had devastating effects on socity. Communism, in fact, has yet to be practiced. By reading this text, you will be able to clearly understand what Marx had in mind, and you will be able to discuss his political theory with an education and understanding. Don't let your opinions on communism be formed by what the skeptics say! This work, including others of Marx, illustrate what his ideas are and one will see that the ""communism"" that has been put into practice doesn't resemble his ideals at all!"
The Communist Manifesto,0140447571,"Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Gareth Stedman Jones",Barnes and Noble,3.5,Guest,"I really enjoyed this pamphlet. As a teenager, I know that kids today are raised with ""communism is evil, capitalism is good, and that's that"" without being explained to what exactly they are, and why one is considered bad, and the other good. this book is sometimes kinda boring at parts and hard to understand, mostly due to the vocabulary, but other times is wonderful, enlightening, and makes you upset about current society. you'll find yourself thinking, hmm communism is a good idea! i suggest this book to everybody frustrated with capitalism. WORKINGMEN OF ALL NATIONS, UNITE!"
The Communist Manifesto,0140447571,"Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Gareth Stedman Jones",Barnes and Noble,3.5,Anonymous,"The Communist Manifesto is probably the most misinterpreted and misused book in history, (probably second to the Bible). Though it may need few revisions to be applicable to the 21st Century global economy, the core message remains universal and timeless. Marx says that if globalisation is inevitable, workers must rise up to see to it that it serves for the best interests of all humanity. Though he wanted socialism to be established as a phase in fully industialised countries, history had other plans leading to the 1917 revolution in the backward feudal Russian Empire. Manay praise this book, a few curse it, but no one can ignore it. Simply, timeless."
When You Reach Me,0385737424,Rebecca Stead,Barnes and Noble,4.3,GrandmaCN,Purchasedbook for my 10 year old granddaughter.  She couldn't put down and really excited her.

The Bonfire of the Vanities,0553381342,Tom Wolfe,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"Although too descriptive at times times,I was taken by the depth and passion of the narrative  and the brilliance of the characters development .Very interesting plot!"
The Bonfire of the Vanities,0553381342,Tom Wolfe,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"Almost two decades after this New York Times bestseller hit the shelves, and only after witnessing author Tom Wolfe on a recent 'Book Talk' interview on CSPAN, did I decide to read 'The Bonfire of the Vanities'. I have not seen the movie of the same name, however, I understand from the interview, that it was 'poorly done.' My 637 paged copy of this trade paperback began with a confusing confrontation between the mayor of New York and a Jesse Jackson-type Black spokesman. But I didn't let that stop me. Prior to its reading, I imagined the book to be about the high life of the rich, and it certainly is, however it is actually more of a richly fleshed-out 'Law and Order' type episode spread over the thirty days during which I consumed it. Ignoring the New York and Southern America dialects spelled out by author Wolfe: 'That's nuthun Shuhmun' (and I'm not certain how necessary those were for a book created to be read silently to one's self) I soon found myself, heart throbbing, in the supple leather seats of a black, two-door Mercedes 'roadster', rocketing up a highway ramp somewhere in the Bronx, and hooked on this finely written piece. Talented authors, whether by design or not, force their readers to forever carry pieces of their story. From Hemmingway's 'For Whom the Bell Tolls' I will always remember the long walk of the captured with villagers on either side, ending with a forced leap to death from the cliff at the end of the path. From 'Bonfire' I will always see in my mind the extravagant parties with the overly gracious hostess meeting incoming guests and guiding them to clusters of 'conversational bouquets', like a gardener planting bulbs next to one another in the freshly turned warm earth of her garden. The author calls the wives of these millionaires, who have starved themselves in the late 1980s fashion of Karen Carpenter, 'X Rays.' If you are searching for a book with a clear cut, warm and fuzzy happy ending, this work, ending with a five-page epilogue isn't it. However, if you are interested a reading that has plenty of twists and turns in the burroughs of New York and visits courtrooms, lawyers, cops, thugs, luxuriant Fifth Avenue Townhomes, bond market trading floors, eleven-dollar-a-drink restaurants, the alcohol-soaked psyche of a tabloid journalist, and the tortured egos of married men who can't keep their pants zipped, all the while painting word pictures that will remain in the frame of your mind for years, read 'The Bonfire of the Vanities.'"
The Bonfire of the Vanities,0553381342,Tom Wolfe,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"Simply stated, the best book I have read. Mr. Wolfe has the ability to put the reader inside the character's head. The initial police questioning of Sherman McCoy had me edgy and feeling the anxiety of the character as if I were the one being investigated. A great read."

This is a story that has true incidents at its foundation: Three plane crashes in Elizabeth New Jersey in the 50s. The ripple effect with the children, the families, friends and strangers in the vicinty makes for compelling reading, in true Blume style, and for another great summer adult read by one of the most well known authors of YA and Adult books these days. Although it takes a while to read at close to 400 pages it draws you in and keeps your interest as the story unfolds and refolds upon itself.

The book lives up to its pre-release hype. Enjoy."

When Marty sees Shiloh he wants to keep him. The problem of this book is Judd Travers,the owner of Shiloh,wants him back. This book will get you emotionally hooked to the end. We really like how many details the author put in because it really makes me imagine the story and helped me understand how they felt."
"Shiloh (Shiloh, #1)",0689862229,Phyllis Reynolds Naylor,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"Have you ever loved something so much that you would do any thing for it? Well Marty Preston did. The book Shiloh was written by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor and it was the 1992 Newbery Medal Winner. This book is great for people that like realistic fiction books. You should read Shiloh because of the amazing story plot and the amazing characters. This is incredible story about a friendship like no other.
This book has an amazing story plot. I loved the idea of Marty keeping Shiloh a secret from the rest of the rest family. I liked it because it keeps you on the edge of you seat, wondering what will happen next to Marty and Shiloh. Another thing I liked about the plot are the things that Marty did to keep Shiloh a secret from everyone else he knew. One thing Marty did was Marty did is that he was always up on the hill behind his family's house where Shiloh was. Another thing he did is that Marty put squash and other foods away for Shiloh to eat later, but his mom knew that Marty did not like squash. The last thing is that Marty would lie to people to keep Shiloh secret. One person he lied to is his friend, David Howers. He said that David was not allowed to come over to his house because his mom's head was hurting her and that she did not won't anyone to come over. I thought that this was a very good book about a boy and a dog.
The next thing I liked about the book was the characters. One of the characters that I liked was Judd Traverse. I liked Judd even though he was the bad guy in the book. One thing that Judd did that I did not like, but made the story better was that he was mean to his dogs. One thing Judd did is that he starved his dogs to make them hunt better. Another thing he did is that he kicked his dogs to tell them to go away. I liked him because he added to the book. I think this because if he was not in the it would have not have been as good. That is why I think Judd is a good character.  
In my opinion Shiloh was an amazing story. I liked it for its unique story plot and for its strong characters. If you like fun and powerful books then this is a book for you.

This was definitely a page-turner, fast-paced with a lot of edge-of-your-seat action and adventure. Alina is such a little fireball, fighter of the dark and powerful forces, braver and stronger than she thinks she is. Mal, her best friend, the one who loves her, guards and protects her with all he can. And Nikolai, pirate or privateer .... I put it together before the story revealed his true identity, but he is quite the surprising twist of a character! Love him! This series was quite the surprise for me - well done Leigh Bardugo!! I.

"The Redbreast (Harry Hole, #3)",184343217X,"Jo Nesbø, Don Bartlett",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"Those long winter nights must evoke creative juices, because Scandinavian detective thrillers are a terrific genre.  Knowing several of the popular Swedish series, I had until recently not heard about Norway's Nesbo, but I'm happy that's changed.  He manages to weave together several major stories, with unanticipated twists and turns, linking past and present mysteries over several decades, and in the process he tosses in a dose of Norwegian history that is as interesting as the rest of his story."
"The Redbreast (Harry Hole, #3)",184343217X,"Jo Nesbø, Don Bartlett",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"I know the author of ""Redbreast"" is not Joe Queenan; I am thanking Mr. Queenan for his recognition of Scandinavian writers as a fresh voice in the mystery/crime fiction genre. Spot-on.
The non-spoiler summary:
A few good cops, some with some bad habits, are pitted against office politics (and office politicians, as well as some not-so-good cops) while trying to catch a skilled killer with quite a bit of method, and history, to his madness.
The substance:
Jo Nesbo (don't know how to do the o-slash) is a solid but creative writer with the instinct to tell a real, honest-to-goodness human story that draws readers in without insulting their intelligence by weighing them down with unnecessary details. About halfway through the book, I had to smile at the writing skill - it's been awhile since I've read a story constructed as thoughtfully as this one. ""Redbreast"" has (enough) surprises to keep the reader intrigued, and although the material doesn't use the accepted U.S. standards for action, romance, or drama, Nesbo blends the perfect recipe of all three into an underlying plot related to one of the main characters."
"The Redbreast (Harry Hole, #3)",184343217X,"Jo Nesbø, Don Bartlett",Barnes and Noble,3.9,knittingnancy,"A complicated combination of characters is introduced to us when they are young and reintroduced to us over 50 years later.  I admit to being confused more than once until I started to see how the author uses this devise to keep the reader off balance. Once I thought I had it figured out...bam...Nesbo quickly pulled the rug from under my feet.

The translator does a wonderful job. too.  The phrasing in natural and the characters, although sometimes hard to keep straight, are very believable."
"Leviathan (Leviathan, #1)",1416971734,Scott Westerfeld,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Mark_J913,"Before all the teenage steampunk fans crucify me for the perceived low rating, let me explain my system.  Five stars would mean this is one of the best books ever written, one that I'll re-read multiple times over my life.  Four stars means an excellent book that I'll likely re-read one or more times.  Three stars means a good book that time permitting I may read again sometime, or in the case of a series, I will definitely read the next installment.  So, three stars is really a pretty good rating.  I just think that, like grades in school, ratings can get awfully inflated to the point that they become meaningless.

Now, to the critique.  The story's concept is interesting enough--combining traditional steampunk (if steampunk is even old enough to have a tradition) with genetic engineering.  The genetic engineering part, making ships and such out of altered animals, isn't a new concept--see Harry Harrison's West of Eden, published in 1984.  But, this is well-conceived for the most part and adds an interesting element of conflict to the story, more so than just two cultures with the same ""Clanker""-type technology.  The story line too is interesting--the young girl masquerading as a boy in order to be in the air service, and the young prince caught in a political struggle for control of an empire.  Prince Alek's situation is neatly tied in with the actual historical assassination of the Archduke that led to our real-world World War I.  The main characters are fairly well drawn and likeable.  Some of the supporting characters are a bit one-dimensional but it's not a serious flaw.  

The book has one rather egregious technical error, which while it doesn't really affect the story, is also one that would have been easily avoided.  Several references are made to the odor of hydrogen, including a scene in which Dylan/Deryn chides Alek for not being able to recognize it.  The trouble is, neither should Dylan or anyone else, because hydrogen is odorless.  This could have easily been solved by having the hydrogen tagged with a marker gas (like methane--that vaguely fart like smell is not actual methane, which like hydrogen is both flammable and odorless).  Or, more in line with the genetic engineering theme, would be to genetically engineer the sniffer dogs so that the presence of hydrogen in their noses would create another chemical they could smell. Or both--the sniffers could be engineered to detect very low levels of hydrogen that wouldn't be picked up by the humans even with a tag gas.

Other weaknesses include the heavy reliance on altered beasts to perform jobs on the airship.  With the emphasis on weight that is so important for a lighter-than-air ship, one would think that having to keep dozens of hydrogen sniffers on board plus their food would make the air service think seriously of coming up with something a bit more mechanical that would take up less weight, space, and not need food.  It's not too hard to conceive of a mechanical device to sense hydrogen leaks.  Likewise the birds and bats used for defensive and offensive purposes--the range seems limited, and birds and bats will fly much slower than bullets.  It would seem to be pretty easy to develop attack tactics for the Clanker airplanes to stay out of range of the birds and bats and blast the whale airship with incendiaries.  

All of these nits aside, the book was an entertaining read, and I will most likely read the next one in the series."

Have you ever experienced that exhilarating rush of relief on the last day of school?  The realization: no more anything, no more homework!  Suddenly, your teacher stands up to make an announcement.  They blubber on, you're growing up so fast, blablabla, and she tells you that you have to read a history book.  History?  You know you're going to be bored.  But you don't have to be.  The Leviathan, by Scott Westerfeld, is fantasy/history, so make sure to stock up on some snacks for the hours in bed you're going to spend snared in the adventure!
There are two sides to this story, but we'll start out with Aleksander Ferdinand, the 15 year old prince of Austria-Hungary.  While he is in the palace, supposed to be sleeping, he steals away with the Master of Mechaniks, Otto Klopp, and his Fencing Master, Count Volger, into a Cyclops Stormwalker, a huge war machine, after learning that his parents were assassinated in Serbia, a Darwinist nation. 
Darwinist nations include Russia, France, Britain, Algeria, and Serbia, and they employ fabricated beasts as their weapons, while Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire are Clankers; they rely on their steam driven war machines.  Alek is no exception, as he flees in his war machine.  The risk of the new reign sending his assassins to destroy the threat (Alek)is too great.
With the aid of his small crew, they pilot the Stormwalker through enemy Clanker lines to Switzerland, which is neither Darwinist nor Clanker.  Therefore, it remains neutral in the coming war driven by his parent's death, and conceals a castle full of provisions for Alek to wait out the war.
      
The other side of this adventure is the perspective of a young 15 year old Darwinist girl named Deryn.  She has always dreamed of being in the Air Fleet, but only boys are admitted.  However, she disguises herself as a boy and gains entry.  When she gets there, she, along with her peers, has to take a test to rule out the squeamish.  This involves riding up in a Huxley, a hydrogen breathing air-jellyfish.  As she floats up (totally unafraid) a storm blows her and the Huxley away, and they become stranded in the sky. 

Lo and behold, a savior appears-the Leviathan!  The Leviathan is a huge, living sperm whale that turns its food into hydrogen, keeping it aloft.  It has blimp-like parts, including walkthrough innards and a metal compound on its belly.  After securing Deryn as part of its crew, they touch down to pick up a mysterious woman with an equally mysterious clutch of eggs in tow.  Then, as they enter the Swiss border, they are shot down by Clanker zeppelins, and are stranded on the ice.  Deryn loses consciousness when she is thrown from the hull on impact.  Alek appears from the snow, determined to help this enemy crew, and ultimately saves her from frostbite.  Even though they don't often agree, Deryn is grateful that he rescued her:

""Yes,"" Alek said, ""a frostbitten bum would've been unfortunate."" page 236

The Leviathan is less fortunate.  Without food, it will never survive and heal.  Alek has the required quantity, but will he give it up?  Even if he does, will the wounded air ship heal in time to escape a hungry fleet of Clankers waiting to finish them off?  Find out in this incredible adventure that will forever change the way you think about history.
But first, will you like this book?  It is shrouded in conspiracy and high vocab, so I would recommend this book sixth grade and up; adults will like it,"
"Leviathan (Leviathan, #1)",1416971734,Scott Westerfeld,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,This book keep me reading and on the edge of my seat. There were a few dual moments but they were picked back up by guessing on what was going to happen next and ongoing suspense. The setting is kept mostly in Switzerland when our two main characters collide and it makes for quite the situation. The book is overall a great read and is good for anyone that likes to get away from reality for awhile.
Goodnight Nobody,0743470125,Jennifer Weiner,Barnes and Noble,3.8,readtolive_livetoread,"I enjoyed Weiner's witty dialogue and wonderful voice. I also enjoyed the backdrop of suburbia, giving the novel a Desperate Housewives-meets-Susan-Isaacs feel to it, but things sort of go downhill about halfway through the story. Kate's life is underdeveloped. Her married life is of very little consequence in the novel. Yes, her husband works a lot and is hardly ever home, and we all know that she's not in love with him, but some more scenes and interactions between them wouldn't have hurt. Most of the scenes center on Kate playing the amateur sleuth, leaving her kids under her friend's care for most of the novel. Her history with Evan McKenna is very interesting, and I would have liked to see more scenes with them together, but again, there is very little of that in the novel. It gave me the impression that even the author herself thought the heroine's life was boring and that is why she devoted most of the story to the whodunit storyline. The ending seems rushed. In the last forty or so pages, it seems that Weiner suddenly remembers that she's almost reached her deadline and has to wrap up the story, so she does a quick resolution regarding Kitty's murder and leaves the heroine's issues unresolved. The unresolved thing is fine with me in books. After all, literature mirrors life, and not everything is wrapped up in a neat little bow in life, but I feel cheated in this one. I would have liked to have known if she'd settle for Ben or risk everything and go for Evan, who is an interesting character in that he's flawed and not a perfect romantic hero (he, after all, is seducing a married woman with kids). It left me feeling as if the heroine's life hadn't been interesting enough to even give it a dignified semi-resolution. Instead of doing that, the author decides to resolve Kitty's parentage, which, to be honest, was of very little interest to me. (Maybe, just maybe, Weiner intends to write a sequel, or turn the whole housewife-slash-sleuth thing into a series, in which case I can understand the loose ends.) Ah, well. Goodnight Nobody is a great, entertaining read. Perhaps you'll enjoy it -- warts and all."
Goodnight Nobody,0743470125,Jennifer Weiner,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Guest,"This is definitely my least favorite of all Jennifer Weiner's books. Its not exactly like her other books which made it hard to get into in the beginning, but I did become more interested as i kept reading.

How to Stop Worrying and Start Living,0671035975,Dale Carnegie,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"Dale Carnegie wrote some great books back in the 30's and 40's, and this book is one of them. Readers who liked Carnegie's bestselling How to Win Friends & Influence People won't be disappointed in this book. The writing style is classic Carnegie. To put it simply, the guy just writes like he talks. This makes for a very friendly and easy to understand book, rather like a good friend giving you a piece of advice. And a lot of advice he gives. The book is divided up into ten sections, each one tackling some aspect of worrying. I could give you a rundown of the topics, but you don't really need me to repeat the table on contents to decide if you want to read the book. Rather, let me just say that book covers just about every major ""worry issue"" that might be causing a troubled mind, such as your work, your finances, other people's criticisms- and them some. While there are no earth-shattering, never-before-seen tips in the book, I wouldn't hesitate for a second to recommend it to anyone who is looking to ease their mind a bit. That's because it does a GREAT job of conveying simple wisdom that really make you think good and hard about why you're worrying and if those things are really worth worrying about at all. In short, its a bestseller because it makes a lot of sense and its advice can do a lot to re-frame your thinking about things. And if you can re-frame your thinking, well, you've about found the best ""Compound-W"" for worry warts."

We all notice patterns in our daily lives that make us feel better and try to remember them so we can stay in our state of 'euphoria' and 'productiveness' for long amounts of time. This book helps remind you of all those wonderful things you remember to help you live a better life, from relaxing the eyes to prevent fatigue to reading valuable quotes by Jesus that prove we were not, as humans, meant to worry about anything! This book is not recommended for those who have trouble worrying, it's recommended to EVERYONE in this world!

Then by the end she crams it all in like she got so tired in the other parts and tosses two years on a page, like its very rushed at the end.

Animal Dreams,0060921145,Barbara Kingsolver,Barnes and Noble,4.4,bubblegumdrop,I love the story of Codi's life and about everything that has happened to her since moving back to Grace. It's a great love story where the character goes back to her first love. There are parts where it does get really boring but then it gets to the point where i could not put it down. The fact that Codi doesnt have a good relationship with her father but stills go back to help him in his time of need really means alot to me. I like how Codi has grown through the book from forgetting to water he plants to teaching a hishschool class is really important.
"The Mortal Instruments Boxed Set: City of Bones; City of Ashes; City of Glass (The Mortal Instruments, #1-3)",1416997857,Cassandra Clare,Barnes and Noble,4.7,JT_bksllr7,"I have never been the sort of girl who was ever been interested in teen vampire romance.  Being a bookseller, however, forced my hand at having to read the Twilight series - and to my suprise it wasn't that bad.  In fact, I read one a night.  So I shouldnt be suprised that when I picked up the Mortal Instruments Series - which I felt I had to read before recommending it to customers - I not just liked, but loved this series.  Is there still a lot of teen drama with love triangles and forbidden loves? oh ya. But there are so many redeeming qualities.  For starters, Cassandra Clare does an excellent job of developing some pretty dynamic characters.  Every character is developed to where you know them and maybe even identify with them.  The characters are extremely diverse and so the story balances out well.  
  There is also a much more complex plot line that is riddled with adventure and intrigue as opposed to other teen vampire romance books.  What is so excellent about the series is the delicate balance that Clare constructs between the teen romance, the extreme action and fighting scenes (thats right, they actually fight the bad guys in this series...)and the magic/ underworld culture that is the series. I cannot think of a point in the series where I was not entertained.
  This series is also very ""clean"" so-to-speak... lets just say that unlike the Twilight saga, no one ever does enough to become pregnant... I'm just saying... and all romance scenes are short and clean. There is also little to none inappropriate language.  This was an excellent seris that I have been recommending to teens and parents shopping for teens who loved Twilight.  I hope you enjoy Cassandra Clares fantasy world as much as I did! Happy Reading!"

I picked up the first book in this series just to have a book to read on an airplane, but I quickly bought the remaining books and completed reading the trilogy very quickly. Its very easy to get hooked on the characters and before you know it you just have to find out how things are going to end. There are alot of fantasy elements here, so if that is not your thing you probably shouldn't bother with this series. Also, if you are easily offended by religious implications (i.e., angels, demons, God, Satan, etc.) you probably shouldn't bother. But, if you are pretty open minded and like a tale that keeps you guessing until the end, you should definitely check this one out. I promise you won't be able to stop after the first book."

SIDNEY SHELDON IS PHENOMENAL. THIS IS MY  ALLTIME FAVORITE BOOK (AND I READ ALOT OF BOOKS)."
"If Tomorrow Comes (Tracy Whitney Series, #1)",0006479677,Sidney Sheldon,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"From the beginning to end, If Tomorrow Comes catches the reader¿s attention.  Sidney Sheldon created a strong female character named Tracy Whitney. She is faced with life-threatening conflicts throughout the novel and loses everyone she cares about.  Sidney Sheldon makes it hard for the reader to set down the book.  There is action and suspense that keeps you wanting more.  	Tracy Whitney encounters numerous conflicts all throughout the story.  She spends her time getting revenge on the men that ruined her life.  In the beginning Tracy has a fairytale life.  She is about to be married to the man of her dreams and is pregnant.  Due to the loss of a family member, she encounters the man who ruined her family¿s life, Joe Romano.  He not only caused the death of her mother but also got her thrown into jail for robbery.  Tracy Whitney serves time in jail and plans her escape.  She rescues a young girl and is released early.  This is when she starts to plot her retaliation upon everyone who made her life miserable.  	The story is thrilling from start to finish.  I would not recommend this book to children under the age of thirteen because of obscene language and sexual content.  In every chapter something happens that is life changing to young Tracy.  She manages to get back at her enemies, without actually killing them herself.  Tracy Whitney is not a realistic character, or stock.  I don¿t believe that she could handle all of the things she went through especially, when it happens so drastically.   She is unpredictable and doesn¿t do anything she seems to intend to do.  This book is mysterious, Tracy Whitney keeps you on the edge of your seat with suspense.  	This book is remarkable because it shows how to remain strong through everything no matter what happens to you.  The only person that is there for you is yourself, and no one else can make you happy or be there for you.  Sidney Sheldon really knows how to keep you in suspense.  I recommend this book to everyone over the age of 13."

Pope Joan,0345416260,Donna Woolfolk Cross,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Fluteymama,"My husband and I both read this and found it very interesting.  I enjoy historical books, and found this to have some good information, especially regarding the herbalism/healing of the time period.  The theory is a unique one.  I did read the author's notes prior to beginning the book, and that helped keep things in perspective while reading.  Excellent discussion ideas, although you may not want to bring this up with your staunchly Catholic friends!  

The book was a quick read and I have recommended it to others.  Take it as a theory, or straight fiction, the choice is yours, but it does give some thought-provoking material."
Pope Joan,0345416260,Donna Woolfolk Cross,Barnes and Noble,4.2,KrisPA,"Considering that the novel was based on thorough research of a provocative idea--a female pope--I had expected the book to be more interesting. It is compelling reading with lots of action, but the main character, Joan, isn't all that interesting of a person. The side love story is rather boring and predictable. What I found most irritating was the lack of complex characters. People were either all bad or all good and the plot proceeded in an entirely predictable pattern: Joan was very intelligent, etc., etc., outshone her opponents, they got mad, they tried to get even and (usually) Joan and Gerold came out on top. The end seemed rushed to me and entirely anticlimatic. I finished the book and thought, that's it? That's the end? The author's note about the Catholic Church's subsequent cover up of Pope Joan and the evidence that remains that supports the idea of a female pope was much more interesting and intriguing than the novel itself. If you liked Pope Joan with its fast action and simplistic characters, you will love Ken Follett's two books based in the Middle-Ages."
Pope Joan,0345416260,Donna Woolfolk Cross,Barnes and Noble,4.2,fitz12383,"I've always been a big fan of historical fiction and Pope Joan definitely delivers. I mean, a story about a female pope who might have existed? Bring it on! 

Joan is a very strong character. She is brave and educated in an age that saw an educated woman as unnatural and sinful. She also has a vast knowledge of medieval medicine which comes in handy later in the novel. The plot is action-filled; this is a book that sucks you in and can't be put down until it is done. Author notes in the back of the book are very informative about the Dark Ages and the church in Joan's time. I became so interested in the period while reading this book that I found myself researching the legend of Pope Joan...researching for fun! What is that? 

One of the themes of the book is the idea of inner conflict, especially in regards to religious upbringing. Joan is the child of a pagan mother and a strict Christian father. She constantly struggles between faith and doubt and between her mind and heart. 

The novel raises plenty of questions about women in the church both in the Dark Ages and today and whether Pope Joan even existed in the first place. I highly recommend this book for all historical fiction fans and those who enjoy a novel with a strong female protagonist."
Birdsong,0679776818,Sebastian Faulks,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Aphroditecrc,"I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this book.  I was afraid that all the war descriptions would put me off but the book is written so well that you don't feel overwhelmed by the descriptions of the war.  I also really like the way the author ties the different generations together.  The characters are written brilliantly, even the lesser characters, but not in a way that confuses the story or makes it complicated.  It wasn't a can't put down book but I felt very fulfilled when it ended."
Birdsong,0679776818,Sebastian Faulks,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"I am an avid reader of all periods of historical fiction and had never read anything by SFaulks when I picked this book up.  From page one he created such a consuming, emotionally gripping love story that progressed into a war story/details that I never would have guessed the book would contain.  In the course of reading the book I think I actually read much of it twice out of awe for his beautiful mastery of the english language.  His descriptions and understanding of human emotion, both strength and weakness, are brilliant and I found myself feeling as though I was right there in the midst of the trenches and as though I knew each of the men personally.  What astounded me most was the honest realty which he wasn't afraid to portray, sometimes making the reader uncomfortable but lending such integrity to the story and the details.  After reading the book I wanted to research The Great War more to have a better understanding of context for the characters.  Since completing Birdsong, I have also read Charlotte Gray and The Girl at the Lion D'or, which are both excellent as well.  Birdsong is truly a book that will stay with you and will change your life and the way you view history."
Birdsong,0679776818,Sebastian Faulks,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"If you like psychological fiction and can stomach painfully real battlefield stories, this book is for you. Sebastian Faulks' Stephen Wraysford is a complex character even before he becomes a soldier. But I was in awe of how well Faulks depicts the mental stages Wraysford (and his comrades) pass through as the war trudges on and on and on.  What was worse - to be aboveground watching someone's body parts get blown off or tunnelling below, where any day you could be buried alive?     I give the book four stars rather than five because the beginning of the book dealing with his pre-war life seemed disjointed and the interspersed story of his granddaughter told more about her life than was necessary to the story."
"Faith of the Fallen (Sword of Truth, #6)",081257639X,Terry Goodkind,Barnes and Noble,4.6,LadyJai,"Faith of the Fallen is a wonderful example of explaining Marxism in terms anyone can understand. It should be mandatory reading for all US History and English classes. It takes you on a progressive journey of one individual, Nicci, and how she became the way she was, believing what she believed, and eventually realizing the truth in all of what she had done. It also takes you on a journey into seeing exactly how something so small as doing something ""for the good of all people"" turns into the majority barely surviving in a slavery type of life, no joy, no dreams, no wish to better themselves, only expecting those in power, or those who have more than ""their fair share"" to take care of those ""less fortunate"". This book is a journey of those who feel there is more to all this and their efforts to ""rise up and live their own life"". 

The only thing I felt cheated out of was the fact that Nicci's own journey to find this out was too gradual and her eventual epiphany was nearly anti-climactic and did not include the most important element of ""self-sacrifice"" to feel her own ""self-worth"". I did, however, understand that because it was a gradual journey for her, she came to her own conclusions in the end and didn't need someone else to show her the way. So, that, in itself, was a redeeming quality."
"Faith of the Fallen (Sword of Truth, #6)",081257639X,Terry Goodkind,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"Book #6 in the Sword of Truth series. This is one of the great inspiring stories of, hence the title, faith. Not necessarily in any deity, but faith in yourself to stand firm in difficult times. Faith in your fellow man to fight beside you for what is just. This book takes you on the usual roller-coaster ride of emotions. Definitely one of the great memorable books in the series."

"Keys to the Demon Prison (Fablehaven, #5)",1606412388,Brandon Mull,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Dominique-Weasley,"Okay, this book was awesome. It was a perfect ending, to a perfect series. There are a bunch of cliffhanger chapter endings that leaves you waiting anxiously while reading another character's part (you'll know what i mean when you read it!)The returning characters in here are great the ones introduced are just fabulous! I love Bracken! He gets really close to the main characters, especially one in particular. . . but before he got close to that character, the character was really careful, for they knew what it was like to be betrayed. . . I strongly reccomend reading the previous books because it relates a lot to them. I really loved this book (i read it in two days!) and i hope that people will like it as much as i did!!! :)"

"Keys to the Demon Prison (Fablehaven, #5)",1606412388,Brandon Mull,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Anonymous,"This book provided a great adventure along with a wonderful way to end a series...leaving it open to the readers imagination, but giving them a gentle nudge in the right direction.  It was great to see Seth mature during the tale, and Kendra learned to trust again.  Even their worst enemy gets a chance at redemption in an unexpected way."
Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything,159420229X,Joshua Foer,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Man_Of_La_Book_Dot_Com,"""Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything"" by Joshua Foer is a memoir of the author's attempted to win the U.S. memory championship. Along the way Mr. Foer attempts to explain some tricks, techniques and the science around memory.

The book follows the gripping journey taken by Joshua Foer as he participates in the U.S. Memory Championship. As a science journalist Foer becomes interested in the champions' secrets as well as the secrets of the brain which we still do not fully understand.

Foer learns how to naturally memorize information with the help of experts and to master techniques which make memorization easier.

""Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything"" by Joshua Foer is a fabulous memoir which is not only personal and informative, but also highly entertaining.

As a journalist, Mr. Foer became interested in those ""mental athletes"" who can memorize random data (order of packs of cards, long lists, etc.) when he covered the U.S. Memory Championship as an assignment. As he researched more into this area he became intrigued and wondered if he could do it also.

At the start of his research, Mr. Foer went to meet psychologist Anders Ericsson who studies those with exceptional memory. ""SF"" can remember 80 digits after a single hearing, for example. During Foer's attempt, Ericsson would study him - a man without an exceptional memory. However, in a very poignant part of the book he also meets with a man who completely lost his short term memory.

Over the next year Foer studied hard to improve his memory, or rather improve memorizing random stuff (there is a difference as we find out). The path we find ourselves going along with Mr. Foer on his journey is delightful, inventing and funny, the people he meets are interesting and quirky.

Experiment:
Is the human mind really susceptible to the clever tricks Mr. Foer describes in his book?
I attempted to find out.

One of the memorization techniques involves a ""memory palace"" and is supposedly a very old method. The technique involves imagining yourself walking around a familiar building and placing objects on a list in that building (your home, first grad class, grandma's home, etc.).
Supposedly if you walk your way through that ""memory palace"" again you should be able to retrieve those items without an issue.

On pages 92-93 Mr. Foer describes his first memorization list given to him in Central Park by English memory champion Ed Cooke (Pickled garlic, Cottage cheese, salmon, six bottles of white wine, socks, three hula hoops, snorkel, dry ice machine, email Sophia, etc.)

As I walked though my home, in my mind, I placed all fifteen items around my house (using quirky stories such as having three Hawaiian dancers perform with hula hoops on my son's train table) and, believe it or not, it worked.
It amazed me so much I came home and asked my wife to do the same thing.

Guess what?
She did and she was amazed as well. Over the next several days we challenged one another, in random places, to name the list.

As it turned out, learning memorization was a part of every school curriculum in the early years of the country - however, from some reason, it has been abandoned.
That's too bad."
Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything,159420229X,Joshua Foer,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Nook HD,I found this book to be an intelligent read and the best part is that his memory strategies ACTUALLY work. I used his tips to memorize a huge list of items and a week later I remember them all. This book is definitely worth a closer look!
Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything,159420229X,Joshua Foer,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Ghoxt,"After working with publicly available Memory systems and doing my own research for over 20 years it is refreshing to see validation that I was on the right track. The level of humor was appropriate as well for a subject that could definitely use it. Made me laugh out loud on more than one occasion. 

The book was everything it was described to be and then some and gave a brilliant history on the subject, sorely missing by all predecessor tomes on the Art &amp; Science of memory systems.

I look forward to further tangible advancements in learning systems for society as a whole. This book gives a very good dissertation on how the hope is still alive. Now the fun will begin for usable memory systems I'm sure :)

Congrats Josh"
While I Was Gone,0345443284,Sue Miller,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Guest,"This story truly reflects many honest feelings women in mid-life experience.  It is almost too honest for most people to accept because it challenges many of our socially accepted norms of being a wife of a preacher, being a loving and self sacrificing mother, a professional Veterinarian, and a woman.           This story could provide an escape for women to explore their feelings or reinforce how natural the feelings they may have concerning the normal aging process and self evaluation of their lives."
While I Was Gone,0345443284,Sue Miller,Barnes and Noble,3.5,citygirl on LibraryThing,"Why: When I was in high school or college I read The Good Mother. and it kind of stayed with me. It showed that Miller has a way of getting under your skin, which may be why I've avoided her all these years. But when I saw this one at the right price I dove right in.Miller's prose is so natural and engaging it seems effortless, which of course it cannot be. Jo is a veterinarian, very happily married to a minister and with three adult daughters. She finds herself a bit restless in her newly empty nest and a chance encounter with an old roommate sets her reminiscing about an earlier time in her life, and its secrets and she starts wondering what could be different, sending a wrecking ball through her life's placid domesticity. It's hard for me to describe what exactly this book is about, but I found it difficult to put down, mostly due to Miller's prose and characterizations."
While I Was Gone,0345443284,Sue Miller,Barnes and Noble,3.5,jayne_charles on LibraryThing,"This was an immaculately well written account of a family in sudden and unexpected crisis.  The author's style makes it clear that she knows her characters inside out, and she is not afraid to give them personality time, away from the main plot, to allow them to develop.  She was also brave enough to give away the story's main 'secret' with a good third of the book still to go.  This could have led to the whole thing going a bit flat, but it's a mark of the author's skill that it stayed interesting.  This is the first I have read by Sue Miller but would definitely read more.In terms of style, the book reminded me a great deal of 'Saturday', by Ian McEwan, and I'd suggest that if you liked this, you might like that one too."

"4th of July (Women's Murder Club, #4)",0446613363,"James Patterson, Maxine Paetro",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"I read this book and finished it in three days. It's another adventure of Lindsey Boxer, the chief detective of SFPD. Lindseys was trying to catch a serial killer but got messed up with two teen-suspects in a car chase. The two teens ended in a crash and got injured. Being a good cop, Lindsey and her partner put their guns away to help the kids out of the car but the darn teens pulled their guns out and shot at her and the partner. She shot them back in self defense. One of the kids was dead and another was crippled. Lindseys ended up being sued for police brutality by the parents of the teens. This part of the book diverted my attention from the serial killer a little. But in the middle of the book, the tale twisted and ended well. The killer was a good surprise. I enjoyed this book very much. I think it's even better than the Judge and Jury. I still enjoy Patterson's thriller on the whole. It's always a good quick read. This one is a thumb up."

"Bitterblue (Graceling Realm, #3)",0803734735,Kristin Cashore,Barnes and Noble,4.4,OliviaMay,"It's been 8 years since Leck died and Bitterblue ascended the throne. Her days consist of meetings, mounds of paperwork, and attending to the mundane inner-workings of her rule. She is 18 now, living a lonely existence surrounded only by advisers and servants, having essentially been locked away in an ivory tower. Becoming frustrated at her isolation, she begins to disguise herself at night and sneak out into the streets of the city. She has been assured that her kingdom is well-run and that her people are educated and happy, but life outside the castle is very different from what she has been led to believe. She has been lied to about many things. Vast parts of the city are in disrepair, the majority of the people are illiterate, and those who wish to tell the truth about events that occurred during Leck's reign are being attacked and killed. She realizes that her kingdom is broken, still reeling eight years later from the effects of Leck and his sadism. Can she be the queen her people need her to be, when she fears that she may be broken, too?

This book is so rich in its storytelling. Bitterblue is just as smart and fierce as we saw her in Graceling, but she is also sad and lonely and confused. The closer she gets to the truth, the more lengths certain people will go to hide it. Little by little she finds the pieces of the puzzle and begins to construct the true picture of Leck's legacy, but we are never entirely sure whom of those around her can be trusted. The truths that Bitterblue uncovers are heartbreaking and terrible, but she must persevere in order for her kingdom to move forward and heal.

We see quite a bit of Po, and some of Katsa as well as a few other characters from the first book (Giddon, Bann, Raffin, Skye), and it's interesting to see how very little they've changed over the years. I thought one or two of them might be married by now, might have families, etc, but no. They are heavily involved in the Council, which has become much more powerful throughout the seven kingdoms.

The beginning was great, I was hooked immediately; the ending is satisfying, all the loose ends are tied up. My one quibble with the book is the bloated middle. It could have been trimmed down and the story would have flowed better, in my opinion. There are too many subplots involving too many minor characters and after a while it became tedious. Enough bits of the main story kept bobbing up to keep my interest, but I think it should have been more concise. Overall, though, I loved it. I hope Cashore keeps writing about strong female characters. It's so refreshing."
"Bitterblue (Graceling Realm, #3)",0803734735,Kristin Cashore,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"Bitterblue kept me engaged.  It's long, but its really good. I would recommend it for 14 and over because it hints at adult content."

The Sky Is Everywhere,0803734956,Jandy Nelson,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Scarls17,"This book is breathtakingly good.


Jandy Nelson's first novel is a tender, beautifully written book about grief, love, family, and self-realization. Lennie is just 17 when her beloved older sister Bailey dies abruptly and the after affects of the loss are almost catastrophic. Once a talented clarinet player, Lennie stops playing and begins to hide from everything she once knew. The sadness that comes through in the words of this book was almost overwhelming. At times I didn't think I could finish The Sky Is Everywhere because the thought of dealing with a similar loss was just too much.


There is more to the story than just grief, though. Lennie has to begin dealing with being the main player in the story of her own life..something she is not used to. She becomes close to two boys and both affect her in different ways. One is a comfort to the life she remembers, when her sister was still alive, and the other breaths a new life into her and inspires her to live, love, and revisit music.


This book reads like poetry and I absolutely can not wait until Jandy Nelson writes something else. A fantastic first novel and I hope other readers enjoy it as much as I did.


The Sky Is Everywhere  


XO"
The Sky Is Everywhere,0803734956,Jandy Nelson,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Nikkayme,"When Lennie's sister Bailey dies, she doesn't know how to go on. How do you live when someone so important to you is gone? Nelson took the difficult subject of grief and all the emotion that accompanies it and turned it into a story that will leave you reeling. Grief can be a difficult subject for any author to tackle, but Nelson takes the feeling of isolation, of sheer loneliness and despair and makes it palpable.
Telepathically, I tell her I'm sorry. I tell her I just can't confide in her right now, tell her the three feet between us feels like three light-years to me and I don't know how to bridge it.
Telepathically, she tells me back that I'm breaking her broken heart.
The honesty of each and every character explodes off the page and the heartbreak will tear you in two.

The grief instantly pulled me in. That's the thing that held me to Lennie, to Gram, to Big, and to Toby. It was the grief that hung over each of them like a cloud. Nelson takes this tortuous grief and transforms it into a despairing, realistic, and breathtaking story that will charm your soul and leave a mark on your heart.
To my astonishment, time didn't stop with her heart.For days and days, the rain beat its fists on the roof of our house - evidence of the terrible mistake God had made.
I was instantly attached to each of the characters and mourned Bailey as if she were my own sister/granddaughter/niece/girlfriend. Even without ever truly experiencing the Bailey that Lennie remembers, I felt her in each and every sentence, in each and every moment. The love story that just happens to unfold among the grief will have you clinging to life, to the life that Lennie wants, but feels she doesn't deserve.
I don't believe time heals. I don't want it to. If I heal, doesn't that mean I've accepted the world without her?
Toby, Bailey's boyfriend, broke my heart again and again. I wanted to reach through the pages and hold him and I understood the connection that Lennie develops with him. It's almost natural. Their love for the same girl pushes them together. On the flip side, Joe, the soulful, charming, and always smiling new boy, will make you yearn for the happiness and joy he radiates. Without ever knowing Bailey, he anchors Lennie to the world she lives in now. He is the sun on a cloudy day and his smile will warm you from the inside out.

Somehow, Nelson takes a story of infinite, unending grief, and transforms it into a story of living, loving, and remembering. I read it into the wee hours of the morning and forced myself to put it down to sleep. It is absolutely addicting and unforgettable. The hilarity surprised me, yet seemed right. The notes that don the beginning of many chapters are a quirk that feels just so Lennie. My favorite being one that begins:
Grief is a house 
where the chairs 
have forgotten how to hold us 
the mirrors how to reflect us 
the walls how to contain us...
There are no negative thoughts that come to mind with this story and I couldn't imagine it any other way. The Sky is Everywhere is imbued with love and loss and will make you roll with laughter, cry out with despair, and smile so much it hurts.

Opening line: Gram is worried about me.

Favorite line(s): My sister will die over and over again for the rest of my life. Grief is forever. It doesn't go away; it becomes a part of you, step for step, breath for breath.

This book is perfection and I do not say that lightly."
The Sky Is Everywhere,0803734956,Jandy Nelson,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Aliciapaige,I don't know what to say...this book is simply amazing. I laid in my bed after finishing this book and I could not stop thinking about it! I felt the characters feelings and emotions. This book is a must read! You wouldn't be sorry.
"Wyrd Sisters (Discworld, #6; Witches #2)",0061020664,Terry Pratchett,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"A student introduced the English department at my   university to Terry Prachett's  books and I'm   beginning to suspect that 'he' is  really  a woman   because he knows way too much about older   women.  This is a hilarious  book in which I seem to   recognize myself in both Granny Weatherwax and   Nanny Ogg, not to mention my penchant  for  trying   to save baby birds and crying when they die, like   Magrat Garlick.  I have read about 12 Discworld   books over  Christmas break  and have just ordered    7 more.  I lent my copy of Wyrd Sisters to  a fellow    faculty member whose area is Renaissance drama,   and he called me to inform me that I am en evil   woman because he will now have to buy all  twenty-  something books too.  Terry Prachett's books are   emphatically NOT for adolescents only.  The   allusions to literature, folklore, fairy tales, and   mythology make them little primers in general   literary knowledge. This book is based on MacBeth   with some folklore and social comment  thrown in,   but the characters of the  three  wyrd sisters are truly   wonderful.  Buy this book.  Buy the series.  These are   at least as good as the Harry Potter series and I never    thought I'd say that about any books."

I've read some of the Discworld series, still in the early stages, but I adore the witches. They're kind, but also a bit tricky and eccentric, and loads of fun. Who else to be the guardians of justice than 3 slighted witches who could've inspired Shakespeare? Add in a wronged and murdered king, not one but two lost sons, a hostile takeover, a kingdom unhappy, a rag tag theater group, Death in the wings, and a host of other fun characters and you get a wild ride only to be found in this famous series. I can't count the times I chuckled aloud or got deep into the plot completely losing track of time. You never really know where a discworld story is going to go, and that's half the fun! Talk about surprises along the way. I was so amused by the ending. Another great read. Can't wait to see what comes next."

The Tenant of Wildfell Hall,0140434747,"Anne Brontë, Stevie Davies",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"In simple words, this is a love story. Mostof the reviews were misleading to me,focusing too much on the unusual-for-its-time plot. It held my interest to the endand unfolds in a fresh way. Anne Bronte should have as much recognition as her twosisters. This particular edition is part ofthe Barnes and Noble Library of EssentialReading, which says it all. There is anintroduction by Deborah Lutz which althoughinteresting to me, is one to question  Dr.Lutz and other feminist writers/teachers inmy opinion often read far too much into thewritings of women from past eras and theirconjecture becomes fact, which is misleadingand negative.

Art and Fear: Observations on the Perils (and Rewards) of Artmaking,0961454733,"David Bayles, Ted Orland",Barnes and Noble,4.4,kmconverse,"I believe this book accomplished what it set out to accomplish--to describe the perils and rewards of artmaking.  It was not hard to identify with many of the obstacles it describes that are often encountered in the artmaking process.  The book was extremely insightful and had some amazing quotes, and in that light I found it to be a humbling and enlightening experience.  

However, I would not recommend this book to anyone who is struggling to overcome their fear in art. I'm sure there are other books and resources that would be much better fit to motivate and inspire you to continue your art. This is not so much a ""how to"" book, but rather a book that identifies common conditions that prevent us from creating. In other words, it points out the problems. When I read it, I think I was expecting more SOLUTIONS, or at least something a little more positive, but that is not actually the purpose of the book. 

Overall, I found this book to be a great resource for someone who is seeking to understand WHY there are obstacles in artmaking (which was it's purpose), but not so great if you are seeking HOW to overcome those obstacles."
Art and Fear: Observations on the Perils (and Rewards) of Artmaking,0961454733,"David Bayles, Ted Orland",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Mark40CO,Great read for anyone who creates. Leads you through the pitfalls of what art making can feel like. Takes the excuses away and leaves you feeling free to create. All artists should read this!
Art and Fear: Observations on the Perils (and Rewards) of Artmaking,0961454733,"David Bayles, Ted Orland",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"Definitely delivers on what it promises. An organized collection of essays discussing the major pitfalls, hurdles and issues everyday, yes, everyday people go through in the process of practicing their art, hindering and suppressing them, sometimes to the point of getting them to quit. If you've quit or thought of quitting, or have become paralyzingly frustrated, or just having a hard time making music, art, dance, whatever, this is the book for you. Let me add a little disclaimer here: this is NOT a book with all the answers. Ratherm it has some of the answers, and leads to some of the mroe important questions, questions you'll need to answer yourself. Really great book."
"Bitten (Women of the Otherworld, #1)",0452286034,Kelley Armstrong,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"I don't think Armstrong could've started out her ""Women of the Otherworld Series"" any better. This is one of her best books ever. This book inspires fear, hope, and so many other emotions its hard to count. 

She never lets you down with this first book and she never falters to let you care about the characters. Every single one of them. I highly recommend it for a good urban fantasy with some heartbreaking romance on the side."
"Bitten (Women of the Otherworld, #1)",0452286034,Kelley Armstrong,Barnes and Noble,4.3,marywalker31,"In Kelly Armstrong's book, Bitten, the reader will be pulled into a completely different world filled with drama, action, and romance. The main characters Elena and Clay have a love hate relationship that many people could relate too. Their constant fighting and drama will catch the attention of the reader. This book is so different from all the other werewolf books because it relates back to real human life and the struggles, but of course adding the twist of a werewolf life as well. This is the type of book that the reader will not be able to put down. Page after page it gets more and more intense as the fight for territory, revenge, and the only female werewolf unravels. This is an unending story, leaving the last page of the book as open interpretation. The only way to find out what happens next is to continue reading the series to find out more to this intense story of Elena and Clay. Armstrong's words just fly off the page and gives the reader very vivid images and grab their attention. This book will pull the reader into a world of unending imagination. While reading Bitten, the reader themselves will feel as if they are a character in the story as well, imagining what it would be like to actually be their fighting, going through ""the change"", and living everyday life as one of them. This is the first book of a series that will change the way the reader looks at ""Women of the other world."""

"Born at Midnight (Shadow Falls, #1)",0312624670,C.C. Hunter,Barnes and Noble,4.5,BlkosinerBookBlog,"Born at Midnight is an addicting read- I did not want to put it down. It pulls me in right at the beginning with a heartbreaking scene, intrigue and a bit of humor about bbqing shorts =)

    Kylie is a great main character. She has qualities that I admire- courage, loyalty. On the other hand, I was able to connect with her, being a bit of a loner, but letting in a select few. I was on edge the whole book, wanting to find the answers to Kylie's questions almost as quickly as she did.  I felt emotions with her, about her family troubles, her worry and loyalty to her friends, crushing and fighting the attraction to the hot guys, mystery surrounding the guys in the black suits, and suspicion of what she really is.

     I love coming of age, and self-discovery books, and this one fits the bill. I love that the paranormal aspect throws a wrench into it, making already difficult journey even more challenging. 

     At first it did seem like there were too many characters and names for me to keep up with, but I quickly learned more about them, and each plays their own role. I love it when a book has a secondary cast that is interesting, has their own personalities and actually work to further the plot.

   The romance is really well written, my heart was pounding right with her, and I wasn't sure the right choice, it was so well written. The guys were really balanced- not perfect, but close :) And while they were hot, they had deeper qualities as well, respect, protectiveness, and a good heart. 

   This book ended well, it wrapped up without too much of a cliffie, but def enough that I want my hands on the next one NOW. Too bad I have to wait until October."

"The Dream Thieves (The Raven Cycle, #2)",0545424941,Maggie Stiefvater,Barnes and Noble,4.5,ChristinaReadsYA,"Spoilers if you haven't read The Raven Boys yet!

Ten Likes/Dislikes:

1. (+) Ronan, the protagonist - I always thought Ronan was a really well done &quot;bad&quot; boy so to speak. His tortured past, his anger, his violence, his tough attitude, and his tenderness - all of this felt so very palpable, so very real to me in ways that other stereotypical presentations did not. As with Gansey, Ronan presents a facade to everyone else - that he doesn't care, that he doesn't need anyone. But he does. His pain and past are as skillfully explored and textured as the unveiling of his sexuality and the small acts of kindness that he'll perform. His emotional growth is sure-footed and astounding - from near-the-edge to fully fledged hero. If you were not a fan of Ronan in the first novel, you'll be sure to understand and empathize with him in this one.

2. (+) World-building - Have you ever been curious about street racing? I have. On occasion, I hear drivers zooming on the street below, and I'll find drag marks the next day. What happens during those races? Well, Maggie Stiefvater not only makes that environment come alive but also the nightmarish dream environment that Ronan explores and the dreamy magic behind the powers of ley line and Cabeswater. I don't read a lot of magical realism, but Maggie Stiefvater makes me want to believe in magic, believe that magic is real with the world she's slowly building. Plus Stiefvater has introduced even more subtle details to highlight the opportunities that privilege offers - truly yet another wonderful exploration of class.

3. (+) Romance - I don't think there's anyone else who can make me root for a romance that I know is doomed yet can't help but love. Ugh, I know that somewhere along the line, my heart is going to get broken. So there wasn't much romantic action in The Raven Boys. Does that change in The Dream Thieves? A little. And the slow-build? (!!!) I'm frustrated and in love with this portrayal all at once.

4. (+) Character Cast - If I've read your review, you've undoubtedly gotten a comment from me on how the CHARACTERS make this series. How Maggie's made all of them so real by enhancing their character quirks - how Gansey rubs his thumb along his lips, how Adam stays quiet, how Blue scowls, how Ronan curses over and over, how Noah's got that smudge on his face, how Persephone speaks in that quiet little tone, how Calla practices air yoga while mocking the boys, etc. All of these quirks especially show in Will Patton's reading (of The Raven Boys), and I'm sure they'll show again in this audiobook - and that's what also makes the series unique: that it provides enough information for Patton to give accurate and wonderfully realistic depictions of the characters. The only other writer who made characters feel this real (for me) is J.K. Rowling. Even better, this book not only expands on old characters like those in Blue's and Gansey's families (Gansey's primarily to continue the class tension in the first novel.) but also introduces us to some more like those in Ronan's family.

5. (+) Plot - This is Ronan's coming-of-age tale mixed with some of the series plots introduced in The Raven Boys. The main plot is his learning how to control his powers before X and X happens, and in order for that to happen, he's got to learn about himself and his family. The quest for Glendower, the problem of the ley line, and the ominous kiss prophecy for Blue are still there, but they get a lot less focus in this one.... yet in the end, Ronan's plot converges with the series plots in wonderfully unpredictable but beautiful ways. Again there's another open ending that'll leave you puzzled and frustrated but still eager for the next title, still eager to see how Maggie will complicate these plot threads even further.

6. (+) Villains - I was slightly disappointed in the villains of The Raven Boys. They were very real people, but Barrington Whelk was so pathetic, I had a hard time taking him seriously and Neeve was too mysterious for me to understand (her danger). The villains in this book? One of them is so ridiculously charming that I honestly can't compute the violence that he/she commits with his/her personality. Psychopath? Potentially. And yet somehow I'm still rooting for him/her? The other was damaged and used to great effect to highlight Ronan's own character growth. A foil but a dangerous foil. A wacky foil who you'll never be able to predict.

7. (+) Character Growth - The best part about this is that MOST of the characters grow in this novel even though it's primarily centered on Ronan. Adam, you remember what happened to him in the previous book? Well, he'll have to deal with the consequences. Gansey, you remember how Blue compares the vision of him at the beginning to how he seems at the end? Well, his facade is starting to crack. Blue, you remember how she wasn't quite sure of her place until she joined the boys? Well, that's even more evident now. Ronan will obviously have to deal with the problems his power presents... and the other characters? Maybe they don't grow so much as you learn more of their secrets. And my, what complex people they all are.

8. (+) Writing - Oh, how I love Maggie Stiefvater's writing. This woman is so talented. She can go from humorous to sweet to tragic in one scene. And always I shall repeat: no one can create as atmospheric of a mood as she can. Here's an example of the kind of scene she can set: &quot;At that particular moment in time, Richard Campbell Gansey III was ninety-two miles away from his beloved car. He stood in the sun-soaked driveway of the Ganseys' Washington D.C. mansion, wearing a furiously red tie and a suit made of tasteful pinstripe and regal swagger. Beside him stood Adam, his strange and beautiful face pale above the slender dark of his own suit. Tailored by the same clever Italian man who did Gansey's shirts, the suit was Adam's silken armor for the night ahead. It was the most expensive thing he had ever owned, a month's wages translated into worsted wool. The air was humid with teriyaki and Carbernet Sauvignon and premium-grade fuel. Somewhere, a violin sang with vicious victory. It was impossibly hot&quot; (255).

9. (+/-) Pacing - As I've said before, I do find character-driven stories to be paced slightly slower than others, and I think my perception of The Dream Thieves and its pacing was also affected by my preference for the plot in the first book. I just wasn't as captivated and it seemed the pacing was slow in the beginning -- probably for that reason, for that personal preference.

10. (+) The Cover - I still prefer the one for The Raven Boys, but having read The Dream Thieves, this one is so utterly appropriate that I cannot complain.

(For those curious -- why I didn't like this one as much as The Raven Boys. This, I believe, is all personal preference. This book is executed wonderfully, but I'm more of a sucker for the tension that drove the beginning of The Raven Boys. And also a sucker for the quest plot vs. the harness-your-power plot.)

Maggie Stiefvater has produced a sequel full of her usual charm and wit, beautiful writing and realistic characters--a sequel full of magic that's sure to enchant readers of all ages. Highly recommended. I can't wait to read the next book!

PS - For those of you who have read The Dream Thieves, there's a wonderful discussion thread on Wendy Darling's Goodreads review. It made me realize that I'd missed some of the nuances in this story. So much fun to guess what'll happen in the future books."
"The Dream Thieves (The Raven Cycle, #2)",0545424941,Maggie Stiefvater,Barnes and Noble,4.5,ShannonODonnell,"Maggie Stiefvater never ceases to surprise me with the depth and brilliance of her storytelling. This second Raven Boys book, focused on Ronan, is just as good--maybe even better--than the first. I love the way she weaves her words together to create something truly powerful, yet beautiful to read. The romance between Gansey and Blue . . . the introduction of the fascinating Gray Man . . . the roller coaster ride of action and emotion. . . everything comes together to create a stellar book 2."
"The Dream Thieves (The Raven Cycle, #2)",0545424941,Maggie Stiefvater,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Meemo_B,"*Copy provided by Netgalley for an unbiased review.*

I listened to the first book in this series, The Raven Boys, as an audiobook (it's beautifully read by Will Patton, by the way).  I read this second book in the series as an eBook.  I enjoyed both of these books, although I'm certainly not in the YA age group.  Interesting stories, interesting to watch the protagonists mature a bit in this second book in the series and learn their secrets and what's made them who (and what) they are.  There are new obstacles for them to overcome in the quest that was outlined in The Raven Boys.  And of course their quest remains to be completed in subsequent books (it's set to be a 4-book series).  Maggie Steifvater has a lovely, at times lyrical, use of language.  I look forward to books 3 &amp; 4.  And I'll look for them in audio form, assuming Will Patton is the reader."
The Portrait of a Lady,0141439637,"Henry James, Patricia Crick",Barnes and Noble,3.6,Mariposa,I approached the book with trepidation because of what I recalled of James' writing style. I was totally surprised how easily I got used to it and became totally engaged with the book. I loved every word. The characters came alive for me. I thought it would be stilted and dated. Instead it was fascinating and also provided so much material for conversation. Highly recommended.
The Portrait of a Lady,0141439637,"Henry James, Patricia Crick",Barnes and Noble,3.6,Adeline79,"Classic literature at its best. Henry James is a master craftsman who delves deeply into the layers of the human consciousness. It is very detailed and requires considerable effort on the part of the reader if you are to gain full enjoyment and connection with the story. This book is worth the time and effort. It can stand multiple readings even in close succession due to the plenitude of detailed descriptions of setting and characters. It spans such a range of human emotion. It is full of intelligent characters and touches upon important themes such as marriage, love, female freedom, social constraints, wealth, etc, etc.

This is an excellent choice for a book club and for those who enjoy  immersing themselves in a long and detailed story."
The Portrait of a Lady,0141439637,"Henry James, Patricia Crick",Barnes and Noble,3.6,Guest,"Beautiful. That's all I can utter, it was so   unfathomably beautiful. I would recommend this   to anyone who loves old books, and has an   imagination. It takes a certain person to really   appreciate this work of art. Mr. James is an   excellent poet. I will always keep this one next to   my heart."

Before the Fall,1455561789,Noah Hawley,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"This book was not the thriller  I thought it would be   although there are some sensational parts to it. Instead it is an analysis of how people think, why they act as they do, and the outcome of their thoughts and actions . I would say it's  a thought- filled book rather than a thriller."

Dreamland,0142401757,Sarah Dessen,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"Dreamland by Sara Dessen is about a girl named Caitlin, age 16.

Soon after, Caitlin meets Rogerson Biscoe, a mysterious and appealing boy around her age. As their relationship grows stronger Caitlin finds herself in a twisted situation trying to decide between her world with Rogerson and her world with the rest of the people in her life. Caitlin's decision brings her to tough times in this supposed ""Dreamland."" Once this book got going I couldn't put it down, it is written with great detail and form.

Don't let the slow beginning keep you from continuing this novel."
Dreamland,0142401757,Sarah Dessen,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"This book, ""Dreamland"" by Sarah Dessen , is about Caitlin (main character), her sister, Cass leaves on Caitlin's birthday to be with her boyfriend and get away from the college chaos. Caitlin's family goes through some really tough times and Caitlin, later on, decides to do cheerleading. This cheerleading activity leads to unsupervised parties and boys. Caitlin's new boyfriends name is Rogerson Biscoe, who she sees as a great guy, but ends up getting Caitlin into things she normally would not do. Rogerson is really good to Caitlin, until she doesn't show up for a shopping trip that they had planned, and their relationship pretty much goes downhill from there. My favorite part of the book is when Caitlin's parents meet Rogerson. Friends of the family, Boo and Stewart, are playing Trivial Pursuit with Caitlin's parents and everything Rogrson says is correct, leaving the family amazed after some things that they had herd about him. I defiantly recommend this book to anyone who is into ""real life"" books and anyone who will read for hours , because this book will leave you wanting to read on and want to know more. Not a disappointment."
Dreamland,0142401757,Sarah Dessen,Barnes and Noble,4.4,TheSeparates,"I love this book. 
I read it a few years ago, and it is still my favorite book of all time. I haven't found another book that could replace the magic of this book. 

It is a story that talks about the love and pain inside a teenage abusive relationship. It is gripping, scary, powerful, and yet, still beautiful. There is love. There is desire. There is pain. There is confusion. But most of all, there is an understanding you gain from reading this story. You learn to understand why maybe some girls are stuck, or choose to stay in abusive relationships. You may learn to understand the power and life behind a druggie. You may learn to appreciate life in ways you would've never seen before. 

The title of this book is perfect. 
It brings you into Caitlyns life - where everything seems fast paced at times, and slow at others. It's a life where nothing seems like it could be real. But the effects of living in this dreamland can kill her, but leaving it might also.

I feel like I have learned from this book, something about myself, and other girls who may've gone through what Caitlyn has, and also the life behind someone like Rogerson."
The Art Forger,1616201320,B.A. Shapiro,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"This was such a fun story, especially made for art lovers and museum enthusiasts. Reads like a great beach read; the story is interesting enough that you want to tear through it, but not quite the page-turner of Hunger Games or Gone Girl. Even so, i will read it again, and soon, because of course my curiosity rushed me through.

Clare's story is told through three different story lines that come together beautifully in the end without redundancies, which impressed me. The first story of her history three years ago: her torrid affair with a married art professor, a tortured artist type, and their ""collaborative"" painting she paints for him while he suffers a creative block in order that he not miss a great opportunity to show at New York's MOMA.

The second storyline, told thru letter's of Isabelle Gardner about her friendship with Edgar Degas in 1890's Paris, which will help explore some of the mystery surrounding the Gardner Museum of Boston and the famous unsolved heist of paintings including one masterwork of Degas.

The current storyline of Clare's life as a struggling artist who pays the rent by painting reproductions of masterworks, specializing in Degas while she bides her time waiting for discovery and a show of her own. Clare is offered an opportunity she cannot pass up from a promiment (and of course superbly attractive) gallery owner, something so great she wonders if it is a deal with the devil... and indeed, it may be. 

It makes for some very fun, very interesting, very imaginative reading!"
The Art Forger,1616201320,B.A. Shapiro,Barnes and Noble,4.2,dnae,"Oh wow, this book is just captivating! I wanted to immediately read it again when I was finished! The suspense definitely had me going hours on end with this book and I didn't want to put it down. I kept wanting to know more about Claire's past with Isaac and her future with Aiden, her past with scandal and her future with forgery. When would Claire learn that her dependency on men to get ahead in the world as an artist only causes trouble? 

""When I accepted Markel's offer, I thought I'd be learning at the feet of a master painter; instead, my most powerful lessons have come from a master forger."" (loc.1664)

I had no idea how this book would pan out, and the ending was very satisfying. Perhaps it's because of my own love and hobby of the arts that sparks my intrigue, but the author did a wonderful job in telling this story. The slight of humor, the intensity of seriousness, the lightness in characterization was great! In particular I love the imagery she uses, as well as the metaphors and the personification of the artwork. I will absolutely want to reread this book again, as well as any other books by B.A. Shapiro.

First Line: ""I step back and scrutinize the paintings."" (loc. 13)

Last Line: ""And no matter how big the commissions or how great the museums, I suppose I'll never know."" (loc. 3815)

The Art Forger,1616201320,B.A. Shapiro,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,The Art Forger was recommended to me by my mother's best friend who is very well read...so I knew it was going to be good!  This book caught my attention from the beginning!  I am from Boston and very familiar with the Isabelle Gardner Museum heist.  This past week there has also been a lot of hype due to new evidence in the case.  If you like art history and historical fiction then you will love this book.
"Austenland (Austenland, #1)",1596912855,Shannon Hale,Barnes and Noble,3.8,theokester,"Austenland is an intriguing concept that is carried of rather well.  From a high level, it involves a thirty-something single woman named Jane off for 3 weeks of ""Live Action Role Play"" (LARP) in a Regency House populated with servants, gentlemen and other women searching for Victorian style romance.  I expected plenty of sappy moments and coming away with a sugar headache.  Instead, I found a thoughtful and fun (albeit cheesy at times) romance that tries to get to the heart of romance while exploring unrealistic expectations and the joys and pains of obsessions.

Starting out the novel, I was worried that Jane would quickly become a stereotypical archetype...the 'unlucky in love' woman who obsesses over Pride & Prejudice (and other similar books), spurns men as vile and unromantic, and sets herself expectations that can never be achieved.  By the end of the book, many of those traits were in fact proven out.  However, Jane did progress through the novel and explored her own psychology to determine which of those characteristics were realistic and which should be abandoned.  

Her path to discovery was humorous at times, frustrating at others, but in the end felt believable.  I really found myself getting to understand and sympathize with Jane while at the same time wanting to shout at her that she was an idiot.  

I absolutely loved the prefaces to many of the chapters in the book...many of the chapters began with a short description of each of Jane's ""boyfriends"" (of which I think she had 15).  Most were a few paragraphs...one was just a sentence.  Each was very insightful into her character and each was rather humorous...the kind of humor that is funny because you can see the reality behind the pathetic occurrence.  As an example, one of these ""boyfriend"" descriptions tells about how she first saw the boy in class and they shared a glance and then, because he was too shy, she asked him out...to which he responded, ""sure...and what was your name""....which promptly ended their ""relationship"".

As for the other characters, I felt that they were well portrayed, but I had some trouble (as did Jane) trying to sort out the behavior of the actors versus those of the person behind the character.  I really felt Hale did a good job of keeping the true person at a distance while exposing glimpses of reality, but I would have liked to have seen more ""behind-the-scenes"" moments with them.  We get one VERY brief scene where one of the characters is smoking behind a bush and talks about ""getting back to work.""  I would like to have seen moments like that elaborated on a bit more.

The writing and the plot flowed along very nicely and it was a very fun read.  Even though I am a heterosexual male, I did enjoy the book and can recommend it.  However, I can't recommend it to everyone.  For example, most of my friends (both male and female) would likely laugh at the suggestion and never make it beyond the first chapter.  Others would certainly eat it up.  I think that in order to enjoy this, the reader must first have an appreciation, if not a love, of Victorian literature and particularly Victorian romances.  Having at least a perception of the obsession around Pride and Prejudice may also help.

So, two scores.
To those who don't like Victorian romances - 1 star
To those who enjoy Victorian lit, romances, or ""girlie"" books - 3.5 stars"
"Austenland (Austenland, #1)",1596912855,Shannon Hale,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Anonymous,"Shannon Hale's young adult fantasy is wonderful.  Jane Austen is wonderful. So I looked forward to this novel, which was one of the biggest disappointments I've ever read.  It's painfully anti-romantic, almost embarrassing.  The heroine seems to need to apologize for liking Austen, goes to a kind of fake Regency vacation home, where she's forced into uncomfortable clothing, and must endure conversation with players whose titles are incorrect for the period, and who don't seem to know the manners of the time.  She is awkward, making the reader feel awkward: there is no grace, and certainly no romance.  The 'Darcy' character is stiff and morose without charm.  The heroine goes on and on at excruciating length about her ambivalence. I made it three quarters of the way through before I had to give up, as nothing had happened except more dull dialog interspersed with inner maundering."
"Austenland (Austenland, #1)",1596912855,Shannon Hale,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Anonymous,This was a different style than im used to for this author ranging it seems for an older audience. The main character is infatuated with the Jane Austen novels namely Pride and Prejudious. When one of Jane's rich relatives passes away Jane is given a trip of a lifetime. This trip will take her to Austenland where guests an actors dress up into 1700s attire and express the culture of the area along the way. Character style is still much the same as other stories I have read from this author. If you want to read this book I would suggest some knowledge of Jane Austen books because there is mention of them through the book that I was clueless on since I have never personally read the novels.
Half of a Yellow Sun,1400044162,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,Barnes and Noble,4.2,LBanks,This book had me on the edge of my seat for much of the story.  It's incredible and moving.
Half of a Yellow Sun,1400044162,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Staticman,"This book hits home . Being a kid that went through the Nigeria / Biafra civil war, the narrations in this  book brings back true memory  of experiences of that civil war . Two words....... Well written."
Half of a Yellow Sun,1400044162,Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"Half of a yellow sun was an amazing book. It is an epic story with a great plot. The story takes place in Nigeria during the Biafran war. The writer uses themes such as loyalty and betrayal, and describes in-detail what each of the character's thoughts and feelings are. I enjoyed seeing how the characters progressed and changed throughout the story. I didn't know much about Nigeria before I read this story, but this story taught me a lot about Nigerian history. Since the author is Nigerian, she wrote the story very realistically, and explained the events that the characters went through as if they had actually happened. I would recommend this book for high school students or adults, because of some of the adult themes that are in this book."

But to be fair, the idea wasn't bad. Its a pity, cause a good idea fell in the hands of an inept author. Its selling, so let it sell."
At the Water's Edge,0385523238,Sara Gruen,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Anonymous,"I rarely write reviews here, but I feel compelled to because I love Sara Gruen's writing and have since her first book. 
At the Waters Edge is steeped in WW II history but its also a microcosmic look at a slice of life far away from but deeply affected by the war. Quite simply, it's a love story at a time when people didn't know where their next meal was coming from or if they would live to eat that meal. 
I refuse to describe the content of the novel because I don't like synopsizing a plot in depth; this ofyen is self-serving and tends to destroy the story for others. 
Suffice to say, I loved this book. It is my personal favorite kind of story. I recommend it to anyone looking for a cozy, wrap-yourself-up in a different time and place experience. Sara's writing style from Water fof Elephants is exhibited here. You truly can hear her personal voice in every scene. 
If you loved Water for Elephants, you don't want to pass up At the Waters Edge. 
And while you're at it, read Riding Lessons followed by Flying Changes. Different from her others, but no less compelling. Brava, Madam Gruen! You'vecaptured my loyalty once again"
At the Water's Edge,0385523238,Sara Gruen,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Mirella,"Maddie is married to Ellis who comes from a wealthy family. Hank is Ellis' best friends and the two are inseparable. Because Hank has flat feet and Ellis is color blind, they were not called up to serve in World War II. The Colonel is Ellis' father, and he believes the flat feet and color blindness are just an excuse to escape serving. After a terrible family fight, the trio travel to Scotland deterimined to photograph the Loch Ness Monster, something the Colonel had attempted to do many years prior. In this way, Ellis hopes to reconcile with his father. 




It is when the three arrive in Scotland that matters begin to deteriorate. Ellis and Hank begin to drink very heavily. Maddie is often left alone at the inn where they are staying, where she is an outsider, and there is enmity towards any strangers. The heavy drinking begins to affect Maddie's marriage and Ellis' behavior turns cold and hateful towards her. 




What is strong within this novel is how the characters change and develop over time. All three of the main cast undergo tremendous alterations in personality, motivation, and behavior. Sometimes, the changes happened so swiftly, that it was hard to believe. Having said this, the story is still very engaging and I was fascinated by it. The author writes well and the storyline kept my interest throughout. A little bit on the dark side, it has a very rich plot and strong characterization. A very enjoyable story."
At the Water's Edge,0385523238,Sara Gruen,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Anonymous,"I was quite disappointed in this book.  The first half is quite boring, seemingly a long 180 pages to let the readers know Ellis and Hyde are rude, self-absorbed, spoiled rotten brats.  I kept reading in the hopes the book would get better, which it did.  The last half of the book seemed to contain more purpose, although a somewhat predictable ending.  If this is one of the author's best works, I doubt I will read any other of her books."
The Running Man,0451197968,"Richard Bachman, Stephen King",Barnes and Noble,4.1,LaNenaFiny,"So this would have been the first Stephen King book I read cover to cover. I was REALLY excited with the story line and could not wait to start reading it. The mistake I made was start at the beginning and am warning you about it because during the introduction ""The Importance of Being Bachman"" King gives away the ending!!! Not just a ""Oh, and then something negative happens"" but ""Blah, blah, and then he blah blah"" specifically.  If you want to enjoy the book (as I am CERTAIN I would have) DO NOT READ THE INTRODUCTION!!!!

Who does that?? Yes, I get it, it has been republished so you want to add a note, but for those who would have picked up the book for the first time (never had seen the movie either so I don't know if it tells the true ending) the book has been ruined!!!. . . I always pictured Stephen King as a smart man. . . WRONG!

So please! Add a HUGE SPOILER warning if you are giving away the ending of a book before the story even starts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
The Running Man,0451197968,"Richard Bachman, Stephen King",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"This novel is a tense, page-turning, heart stopping chase. I wasn't expecting it to be so suspenseful or so dark. As others have mentioned, don't read the introduction until after you have read the novel since it reveals the ending rather matter-of-factly. The ""Introduction"" really should be changed to an ""Afterward"" with a disclaimer that it reveals key plot elements of The Running Man. I'm not sure why the publishers haven't made this change in recent printings. Incidentally, the other Bachman books share the same introduction, so if you are reading Roadwork or The Long Walk, for example, and you haven't yet read The Running Man, skip the introduction. This novel is more tightly plotted and cinematic than the other Bachman books. The 100 short chapters, titled only as a numerical countdown marching feverishly towards 0, contribute to the feeling that time is running out. The social commentary is biting and caustic, and the ending is both sad and chilling. Although I'm a huge Stephen King fan, I neglected to read this book because of my associations to the movie. The book is much better, much darker, and I am glad that I read it. For King/Bachman fans - don't miss it."
The Running Man,0451197968,"Richard Bachman, Stephen King",Barnes and Noble,4.1,xxSCARFACExx,"This was a great book and it really lies mention to the difference in social groups, as in poor and rich.  It is a fiction and to the extreme.  The ending is very unpredictable and you will find yourself wanting to keep reading to finish the book.  I will definitely keep for a book I might read again"
"Gilead (Gilead, #1)",031242440X,Marilynne Robinson,Barnes and Noble,3.7,MarcusBrody,"Marilynne Robinson is at times a beautiful writer, but this novel is not a showcase for her talents. Many other readers have commented on the absence of plot, which in and of itself is not a mortal literary sin. But when enveloped in a series of platitudes that rarely, if ever, manage to transcend the mundane nature of the narrator (a surprisingly self-absorbed Congregationalist preacher named John Ames) it becomes virtually intolerable. It might have worked as a series of loosely-connected meditations, but like the good Rev. Ames himself they remain stubbornly humdrum, almost banal.

There's a sense throughout the book that Robinson could not quite figure out what kind of person she wanted Rev. Ames to be - he is, at various turns in the narrative, defiant, judgmental, contrite, and resigned. Alas, these oscillations do not make for a complex character, just an inconsistent one. There are many, many passages where the Rev. Ames's voice (which is otherwise one of the few unifying elements) drops away completely, so that it feels as though you're reading a theological lecture by Robinson herself. And yet there's a surprisingly noncommittal nature to those ruminations - everything boils down to ""maybe, maybe not"" (at one point Rev. Ames muses that, ""My point here is that you never do know the actual nature even of your own experience. Or perhaps it has no fixed and certain nature.""). I heard many similar comments over bong hits in college, and they were not more penetrating that Robinson's.

I say this all out of a profound sense of disappointment, as Robinson is clearly a gifted writer. And she isn't afraid to delve into history or religion. This effort, unfortunately, comes up short. With more discipline, and a bit of attention to storytelling fundamentals, this might have been a remarkable, even transcendent book.

I would not recommend this book, except possibly as an effective sleep balm."
"Gilead (Gilead, #1)",031242440X,Marilynne Robinson,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Baochi,"A few years ago, I bought a used copy of Marilynne Robinson's Gilead because it won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2005 and I aim to read most - if not all - Pulitzer Prize Fiction winners through the ages. However, I was in no hurry to read Gilead based on its synopsis. The combination of  a seventy-something protagonist, an obscure town setting, and a religious theme just didn't sound like the page-turning story that I confess I'm always looking to read. Eventually, I had the good sense (or dumb luck) to pack Gilead alongside several other books for a solo vacation a couple of years ago.

I love when my negative assumptions are completely upended, and the object of my assumption is revealed in beautiful truth. That's exactly what happened with Gilead. What I thought would be a boring novel turned out to be a profoundly transforming one.

The story is narrated by minister John Ames, who is seventy-six and dying. As a gift to his seven year-old son, John shares his meditations on life, love, family, friendship and forgiveness. He describes three generations of Ames men, the misunderstandings between them, their love. Whether John is pondering a moment or a lifetime, he is never far from its spiritual significance. Those soulful musings - rather than coming off as preachy or unwelcome or scriptural - are delivered gently, simply. The prose is spare yet arresting and beautiful. Gilead is an experience.and yes, a spiritual one I am grateful for."
"Gilead (Gilead, #1)",031242440X,Marilynne Robinson,Barnes and Noble,3.7,JS-in-KS,"An impatient, cursory reading of this book may not yield its treasures. (Bookwormiam seems to have given such a reading. The pastor most certainly does forgive his wayward namesake. And he proves that he is not too old to see his wrong assumptions and change his mind and heart.) But for those willing to settle in and let the details seep in, there is quiet wisdom and unassuming beauty. One of the few books I've ever read which, as soon as I'd completed it, turned back and began to read it through again."
The Crying of Lot 49,006091307X,Thomas Pynchon,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Judy_Croome,"I finally read this because I¿ve never yet managed to complete a Thomas Pynchon story. I managed to finish this novel only because it¿s short. I¿m left confused about many things, but not about this: I enjoy interesting and different books, but books loaded with pretentious intellectualism bore me to death. 

There¿s story-telling (which entertains and moves its readers) and there¿s word play. ¿The Crying of Lot 49¿ clearly falls in the last category and, while it might provide many readers with a satisfying read, I find the weirdness too weird, the ¿cleverness¿ too clever for its own good and the deliberate manipulation of names, references and language constructs silly. Is Pynchon actually laughing at us, the readers, who swoon at his ¿brilliance¿? Either that or, like Sacha Baron Cohen of the dreadful movie ¿Borat¿ fame, Pynchon is a sad man with a rather warped and gloomy view of the world. 

As a reader, I want more to a novel than pretentious intellectualism posing as literature. I enjoy reading a wide variety of genres and styles, fiction and non-fiction. I don¿t care what I read ¿ as long as it¿s good writing and keeps me engaged. 

Despite the occasional glimpse of what could attract people to this story (for example, Mucho & Oedipa¿s obsessions apparently suggesting ordinary folks¿ obsessive need to believe in some kind of reality and order ¿ I say ¿apparently,¿ because I¿m not entirely sure I ¿got it¿), Pynchon¿s writing required too much effort to make any sort of sense to me.  

Perhaps that was the point of the difficult, delirious writing style: that, despite modern technology supposedly assisting mankind in communicating, Mucho & Oedipa (representing the average human) were still unable to communicate with each other. This novel, far from solving this dilemma, exacerbated it!

It does have its moments of post-modernist epiphany (modern life is uncertain; there is no guarantee of a happy ending), but I¿m a reader who prefers a more traditional (and optimistic!) form of story-telling and will leave Pynchon¿s existential explorations of an entropic society to those readers who prefer ¿high literature.¿"
The Crying of Lot 49,006091307X,Thomas Pynchon,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Maisie_Fullerton,"The Crying of Lot 49 by Thomas Pynchon is a mystery that is equally as witty as it is intriguing. Set in the chaotic cultural collision that was the 1960's, the novel's protagonist, Oedipa Maas, is strung through a plot bursting with conspiracy, paranoia, and insanity. Pynchon's clever puns and use of satire are whimsical and refreshing, and add an air of lightness to the text with the humor they bring. The Crying of Lot 49 is a short novel that openly breaks from the conventions of the typical detective story, and instead provides the reader with the aftermath of a society in crisis. The plot opens with the female protagonist, Oedipa Maas, seemingly trapped in the excruciating monotony of a life reduced to gardening and fixing evening cocktails for her depressive husband. The only momentary interruptions in the tedium that is her life are provided by phone calls from her psychiatrist, Dr. Hilarious, pressuring her to experimentally ingest LSD, and her industrial tycoon ex-boyfriend Pierce Inverarity, who's late night prank calls include a variety of racially inappropriate impressions. One evening, after returning home from a party, Oedipa finds a letter which informs her that she has been made executor of her ex-boyfriend, Pierce Inverary's will. After accepting the request, Oedipa leaves her husband and sedative lifestyle to execute the will. Upon leaving, Oedipa finds herself on the road to a personal revelation she is unable to fully perceive, as well as a mystery she is equally as immune to deciphering. The ambiguous symbol of a muted horn follows Oedipa throughout her journey, prompting her to investigate the source and meaning of its whereabouts. Throughout her inquiry to understand the purpose of the symbol, Oedipa discovers potential secret-organizations, conspiracies, or possibly just her own insanity's bizarre manifestations. Throughout the course of the novel, Oedipa journeys from southern to northern California, through a seemingly endless maize of equally as trivial connections to the symbol. Oedipa is left wondering whether her quest is to exposing an elaborate secret society, a joking conspiracy left plotted by her ex-boyfriend Inverarity to plague her, or if she is out of touch with reality. Pynchon fills the text with satirical portrayals of the 60's culture, including a teenage hippie group called ""The Paranoids"", LSD driven insanity, and anti-government associations, all of which propel Oedipa further into her roundabout investigation of the symbol. As cleverly intended by Pynchon, the reader, as well as Oedipa, is hopelessly left to sift through the unraveled evidence trying to distinguish any reality from all the chaos. The Crying of Lot 49 is a must for the bookshelves of any modern reader."
The Crying of Lot 49,006091307X,Thomas Pynchon,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Guest,"This is by far Pynchon's most easily enjoyable novel, but you still get the Pynchon trademark complexity and innuendo.  Honestly, I give it 4 and 1/2 stars.  The first chapter by itself is worth the price of admission, as it is one of the funniest things I have read in quite some time.  The most impressive thing about the book, however, is the way that Mr. Pynchon has turned the traditional detective story into the ultimate microcosm in a completely unprecedented and unique way, without the over-indulgence of, say, Gravity's Rainbow.  While it could be a better or lesser novel than G.R., it's about as dense a novel as any other authors attempt (especially in the era of Grisham, Koontz, et. al.) and that means that you are going to spend more time pondering the novel than reading it.  It's worth the effort though, because the themes Pynchon explores are ever-present and while they aren't necessarily new, they are expressed in a truly goundbreaking manner."
"Edge of Eternity (The Century Trilogy, #3)",0525953094,Ken Follett,Barnes and Noble,3.2,Anonymous,"Unfortunately, this book is terrible. I love historical fiction and Follett usually does it well. This time, instead a  good story intertwined with what was occurring in real time, Follett allows the fictional characters to make history. The book is very poorly researched and is committed to preaching a political perspective at the expense of what really went on. All the interesting characters from the first two books contribute nothing and the new characters are not very interesting. If, as I did, you want to finish all three, wait until it goes on sale."
"Edge of Eternity (The Century Trilogy, #3)",0525953094,Ken Follett,Barnes and Noble,3.2,Anonymous,"I rarely take the time to rate a book, but thought I may be able to save some people the time of reading this 1,000 page disappointment. 
I have read 5 Ken Follett books and he is one of my favorite authors. That being said, this book fell short of the standard I have come to expect.  
The story line seemed forced and in an attempt to cover too many historical events character development was thrown out the window.  Despite all that, about 1/10 of the book seemed dedicated to cheating, affairs, &ldquo;free love&rdquo;, and undercover husbands.  Ken Follett&rsquo;s books always have this to some degree, but I had no idea I was sitting down to read a soap opera.  I think almost every single character was involved in some sort of sex scandal, making this book predictable, repetitive, and completely ridiculous. 
Very disappointed.  Despite this fluke of a book, I strongly recommend other Ken Follett books."
"Edge of Eternity (The Century Trilogy, #3)",0525953094,Ken Follett,Barnes and Noble,3.2,Anonymous,"Very disappointed. Follett's political leanings are very obvious. I was really looking forward to this book after enjoying the first

"Demonglass (Hex Hall, #2)",1423121317,Rachel Hawkins,Barnes and Noble,4.5,BlkosinerBookBlog,"I was spell bound from page one until the end, and then I wanted even more. 
    Though I'd forgotten a bit, there was a nice refresher that came naturally, and it came back :)   Sophie is still amazing and sarcastic. I laughed so much, and I loved that she could always lessen the tension with her comments. 
    I couldn't decide between Archer and Cal, they are both awesome, and have their own merits. They are both well developed, and though I have a feeling who Sophie will chose, I am still torn. Cal played a bigger role in this one, and maybe added to my feelings. 
    Jenna is in this one too, and she shows a lot of growth. 
    I ended up really liking Sophie's Dad, he's solid and I was shocked by some of the things revealed. 
   I totally wasn't expecting a lot of things in this book, and the ending made me wish I already had the 3rd in my hands!"
"Demonglass (Hex Hall, #2)",1423121317,Rachel Hawkins,Barnes and Noble,4.5,FeatheredQuillBookReviews,"When Demonglass begins, Sophie is trussed up by one of her teachers and thrown into a slimy lake where she must find a way to free herself with her magic, and rise to the surface before she drowns. Of course, the drowning isn't the hardest part for Sophie. When she bolts from the lake she comes face to face with a father she has never seen. He has arrived, and is at Hecate Hall to take her to London for the summer and try to convince Sophie not to go through with 'The Removal.' You see, Sophie doesn't want this kind of power. She wants it removed so she can be a normal everyday teenager - even if the Removal process could kill her or, at the very least, make veins and scars appear on her pretty face. She requests Jenna to come along with her for the summer so she won't be alone and, oddly enough, her father brings Cal. Why? Hecate Hall fans - and there should be tons of them - will be quite surprised as to the reason why Cal is in Sophie's life at all. When they arrive in London, Sophie's heart drops as they take her out into yet another ""nowhere"" location, to a huge house that is over a million square feet, named Thorne Abbey. Turns out, this unending mansion is where Council Headquarters is located - and her father is the head of said Council. The tension builds as Sophie's summer begins with a bang. From an old book of spells and dark magic, to a ghost who refuses to leave Sophie alone, to her reunion with Archer Cross, who has to prove to Sophie whether he is friend or foe, to a pair of odd demons who magically appeared one day and are being taken care of by the Council, Sophie's world becomes a huge mess. When her father explains to her that someone out there in the world is actually ""raising"" demons, as if planning for a war, everyone's true colors begin to shine, and Sophie must find a way to become a heroine, or escape with her life. As good as the first, if not better, Demonglass is a book that you read in one sitting. Rachel Hawkins has created a plot that is non-stop and doesn't mirror anyone else's out there on the market today. Sophie is a fantastic character with a ton of humor, who takes readers by the hand and walks them through her magnificent world that involves every magical creature you can think of - but never gets confusing. Quill Says: Although the characters are many and the realms are fantastical, this story of a young girl just trying to make it through her world is funny, sweet, warm, thrilling, and truly emotionally gripping. Hopefully the third book in this series will be out ASAP!"

"The Awakening / The Struggle (The Vampire Diaries, #1-2)",006114097X,L.J. Smith,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Brookeylynn,"This was probably the right up there with the twilight books. It is incredibly suspenseful, and has the same endearing love as the twilight series. I didn't really understand the summary of the book, so here's one of my own that I think explains it better.Elena is the head of the school. She doesn't feel all that special, but other people seem to think so. She's always turning heads in the hallway. But when Stefan, the mysterious cool-car driving sunglass-wearing hottie comes to school, he doesn't even look her way. Elena swears he'll be hers. Damon Salvatore is sexy and ruthless. He doesn't believe in the same practices of his brother, so he drinks human blood. Once he sees Elena, he's determined to make her his, whether she likes it or not. He's blown into fury seeing the love she has for Stefan, and he's determined to change that. He'd do anything to possess Elena."

I always loved these books, the story is so original and just awesome but there was always one flaw that got to me. Because there are three seperate stories in each book, i felt i never really got connected with the characters enough. but this book changed that! I felt the character's emotions in this one. i got that feeling of desperation and forbidden love that i'd been waiting for! My favorite had to be Witchlight with Huntress running a close second! These two stories were heartwrenching, they left me wishing the entire novel was about them! i got so deeply rooted with the female leads in these two, and i UNDERSTOOD them. i knew where they were coming from, and i knew where they wanted to go as individuals. this book is amazing i suggest you read it! it's really a great book for discusssing with your book buds. because there are so many ways you could feel about this book, me and my firends have totally different opinions about it and that makes it great! it connects with everyone on thier own level!!

"Night World, No. 3 (Night World, #7-9)",1416974520,L.J. Smith,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Booklover21TP,"Night World is an amazing series. I first picked it up because I have seen several people reading it, and I just love L.J. Smith's books. Vampire Diaries was the first series I read by her, and then I read the Secret Circle series, both were very good, so I decided to read the Night World series. I must say that the first two books did not hold my attention as well as the third one did. If you have read the first two books, you have probably noticed that there is just about no story line at all when you read all three sections together. The books had their own thing happening and the only thing that tied the six sections from the first two books together, were the characters. When I finished the first two books I was so glad that I could move on and not have to be jumping around all the time. With the third book actually having a story line to it, I was very happy. It drove me up a wall trying to remember all the characters -- there must have been at least ten in each section! The third book focused more on the individual section instead of the overall picture in some ways. L.J. Smith had an idea for where the entire book was going, but also focused on the sections more. It was so relieving knowing what was going on instead of trying to piece it all together. The prophecies that L.J. Smith incorporates into this book was an ingenious idea. The only bad part about it was having to remember about five of them and what they meant. The prophecy that you hear the most: One from the land of kings long forgotten; One from the hearth which still holds the spark; One from the Day World where two eyes are watching; One from the twilight to be one with the dark, was my favorite prophecy. I would always guess to see which Wild Power matched the part of the prophecy. With L.J. Smith having only three sections in each book, is just killing me with anticipation to when the fourth book comes out so I can finally see if (or how) the world ends, and what certain powers the last Wild Power has. The last part in the prophecy, one from the twilight to be one with the dark, is what I just cannot wait to see who ""plays"" that role, and why they are going from light to dark, and what their motives are. Every story has a soul mate in it, and I'm curious to see how this one goes. In the three sections in the third book, the Wild Power is someone that the main character meets or knows, it is never the main character, so it will be interesting to see if L.J. Smith finally has the main character be the Wild Power, or if it will be like the rest of them. If you like action, romance, vampires, witches, shape-shifters, and/or werewolves, you will like this series if you don't mind different characters every section of the book. This is a very easy and good read for pre-teen and teenager girls."
Fall on Your Knees,0743466527,Ann-Marie MacDonald,Barnes and Noble,4.2,WishICouldWrite,"Incest, rape, racism, violence, forbidden homosexuality coupled with religious fanaticism and ridiculous allegory!  The story is fascinating at first, and then dissolves into a tragically bleak portrait of the darker side of an unsympathetic group of people that have the misfortune to be related to one another.  There is no doubt that the author is a compelling writer; the prose is often beautiful and brilliant but interactions between the characters are derivative and pretentious; those stories have been done more effectively before. Mostly, it seems as though MacDonald feverishly vomited every ""bad"" thought she ever had on to the page so that she could exorcise her own demons or come to terms with her own terrifyingly violent battles with horribly dysfunctional family relationships and religion.   Granted, that can make for a powerful story, but in this case, it is simply a lurid, unoriginal mess that you are painfully embarrassed upon which to intrude. WARNING: it is likely that once you start the book, you will be unable to put it down. After a while you will keep reading because you have to know how it ends. Then you will shut the book, disappointed and  furious that you invested so much time to read the whole silly thing. Despite the often lyrical prose, the book is simply not worth the time and emotional investment the author unsuccessfully attempts to evoke from the reader."
Fall on Your Knees,0743466527,Ann-Marie MacDonald,Barnes and Noble,4.2,leeshaAB,"I found this book to be extremely well written, but dark and very disturbing. It left a pit in my stomach and kept me thinking of the messed up characters well after putting it down. There were points in the novel where I simply HAD to stop reading because I was so disgusted by the storyline and wasn't sure I could finish it. Though Im a firm believer that all stories should be told, (not just light fluffy ones), I would be hard pressed to recommended this book to anyone."
Fall on Your Knees,0743466527,Ann-Marie MacDonald,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"This novel shook me to the very core of my being.  The twists and turns, smatterings of cultural revelations, use of setting as a character in and of itself, and the musings on family (what makes a family and what isn't a family) all merged together to make for an extraordinary novel.  The book is really lyrical and dark at the same time.  I recommend this book to readers who are ready for heavy content that causes you to think very deeply about the human condition."
The Scorpio Races,054522490X,Maggie Stiefvater,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"Maggie Stiefvater makes horses scary. This is The Black Stallion with fangs, a book that's ready to sink its teeth into your shoulder and drag you kicking and screaming through the pages. Stiefvater's use of imagery leaves readers with a frantic drumbeat in their head and the insistent feeling that one should be checking for sand in their shoes. This book is dubbed a love story and rightly so, but the love readers will find here won't be in stolen kisses and awkward gropes on the beach. Instead, Stiefvater's words stir up a mixture of feelings that will have readers looking at the ocean in a whole new way. This is not a book for cynical adults. For people who look around and hate the world, hate their job, and have too many obligations that a 404 page journey through Thisby is about as impossible as jumping on a plane and trying to find Thisby, put this book back. This is a book for teens and one of the best I've read in 2011."

There were parts that were very touching and haunting and if you like romance, action, or suspense you will like this book. The characters were so well developed I feel like they are real people and kind of wish they were! I have recommended this book to all of my friends because I simply need to talk about it more!"

"Morning Star (Red Rising, #3)",0345539842,Pierce Brown,Barnes and Noble,4.8,Anonymous,"The first book captured my imagination and fascination. An advanced Romanesque society, with Greek mixing as well. Darrow's rage burned bright and hot.

Golden Son was enjoyable, and took a second read to get the same enjoyment as Red Rising. 

Perhaps this book will take another read to get everything from it. I was excited with the first few chapters. Dark, gritty, and full of that fire from the first two. As the book progressed, it became verbose and dragged me through hundreds of pages of focus on meandering. The battles lacked the excitement and depth the first two books had. The ending was what I had hoped to happen, as I read the final pages. I had to read the acknowledgements, to finally understand why things played out this way. Then I agreed it could be no other way. 

A fitting finish, even if it lacked the things that captivated me originally. I almost stopped at some points, but I had to see how it finished."
"Morning Star (Red Rising, #3)",0345539842,Pierce Brown,Barnes and Noble,4.8,Anonymous,"This series pulled me in with Red Rising, held my attention with Golden Son, and left me feeling like I was on an emotional Roller coaster with Morning Star. I highly recommend it. There were times that I had to put this book down and step away. It speaks volumes to the writers skills that I was so emotionally invested in the characters and actually felt their losses. It will require a second read soon. I admit to skimming at parts just so I could figure out what happened next. I'm glad I stuck it through, the ending wraps everything up well and left me content as the reader despite (or due to) all of the ups and downs."

"Mossflower (Redwall, #2)",0441005764,Brian Jacques,Barnes and Noble,4.7,PhoebeReading on LibraryThing,"I enjoyed this one more than Redwall in some ways--it's better written and the characters are a bit more multifaceted, the puzzles and trials they have to decipher a little more complex. However, after reading these first two books in the series, I'm already getting tired of the stereotyped depictions of animals--all predators are evil, all scavengers are sneaky, all little rodents are wonderful and bear swords. Honestly, other than giving us an easy system for categorizing characters morally, I'm not sure why, precisely, Jacques insists on making these books about animals at all. The quasi medieval setting would work just as well with human characters. These certainly aren't Watership Down, where we're treated to an unexpected, rich depiction of the life of another species. This is, instead, like going to a Renaissance Festival where every character is wearing a Micky Mouse suit.The best part of this series is, by far, the lush descriptions of food. I might buy the Redwall cookbook, but I don't think I feel like reading the rest of the novels in this series."

If you're interested in starting another series... I've found Laurell K. Hamilton's character Anita Blake to be a similar (but much more hard-core) version of Stephanie Plum who solves vampire and paranormal mysteries."
"Visions of Sugar Plums (Stephanie Plum, #8.5)",0312986343,Janet Evanovich,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Guest,"I think people take this book a bit too seriously. I personally loved it, my favorite character, Ranger, doesn't show and obviously that was disappointing, but with the book being a meager five chapters it's hard to be too upset. This VERY random introduction of superhero types will definitely upset a lot of people, but I loved it. It's random, it's fun, it makes me wonder about the true origins of Ranger. It's risky and out there but at the same time refreshing to see something like that tossed into a series at random with no apparent intention of making it part of the general plot.  But try not to think of it as another Stephanie Plum novel, as it's obviously not, even if it has most of the characters. More like a short story, not meant to be incredible, maybe just fun, maybe 'just because'."

Left Neglected,1439164630,Lisa Genova,Barnes and Noble,4,irishbookworm21,"Like most working mothers, Sarah Nickerson never has enough hours in the day.  Between her high-powered corporate job, husband, three children, two homes, Sarah has filled every minute of every day with something.  Life is literally passing her by as she tries to have it all.   One rainy night, Sarah is rushing back to her office to put in more hours, begins digging for her cell phone, and in an instant, her life is changed forever.

When Sarah wakes up from a devastating car accident, she is suffering from Left Neglect.  Due to damage to the right side of her brain, Sarah no longer recognizes anything on the left side.   As she begins to work towards her recovery, Sarah also begins to realize all of the other aspects of her life she was neglecting.  She may have had money, power, and prestige, but she was missing out on soccer games, piano recitals, and the lives of her husband and children.  Sarah's injury and recovery force her to re-examine her priorities and re-evaluate what is really important.

Left Neglected is a fantastic novel by Lisa Genova.   Her characters, while affluent in this case, could really embody the lives of any working family.  We all get caught up in the day-to-day activities and begin to take our blessings for granted.  We simply get so busy in our lives that we forget to really live them.  Genova crafts the story wonderfully, taking readers on a walk through the lives of Sarah and her family.

If I had any negatives to post, it would be the sort of glossing over of the relationship between Sarah and her mother.  Additionally, the story could have been built up further with regards to the other characters as well, as the length of the advanced copy of the book is only at just over 300 pages.  That leaves a lot of additional space for learning more about the lives of Sarah and her family members beyond what is written.

The hope here is that Genova's tale is enough to make us all take a step back and rearrange our priorities.  Maybe we cut back on the things we really don't need.  Maybe we have our children choose one sport instead of trying them all.  And maybe, just maybe, we realize just how precious life is right now, instead of waiting for a tragedy to teach us differently.

Left Neglected,1439164630,Lisa Genova,Barnes and Noble,4,Lynie,"Sarah Nickerson has it all; a loving husband, three young children, a high powered job, an expensive home and a vacation home in Vermont.  She also has all of the accompanying stress of trying to be everything to everyone.

Rushing as usual while trying to keep all of her balls in the air, Sarah is driving to work in the rain while on her cell phone when the unthinkable happens.  She has a car accident while going 70 mph and wakes up in the hospital with a severe brain injury that has caused a condition called left neglect.  Sarah's brain is unable to recognize left; the left side of her body or anything in her left field of vision.  

LEFT NEGLECTED is more than just the story of Sarah's injury and steps to recovery.  There's the underlying story of the neglect she experienced growing up with a mother who was overwhelmed by depression and grief following the accidental drowning of Sarah's young brother.  As she faces her rehabilitation and her future, she also begins to face her relationship with her mother and the dawning realization that her own family has been left neglected because of the lifestyle she and her husband Rob have chosen.

LEFT NEGLECTED is not all doom and gloom.  Ms. Genova has injected a sense of humor into her characters' dialog that makes the story easier to read and thoroughly enjoyable despite the dark subject matter.  Lynn Kimmerle"

Hundreds and Thousands of families were being hunted down. This could make you feel a number of different emotions;helpless, scared, sad, frustrated, angry, or all of the above. Imagine yourself sitting at home and hearing the ring of a telaphone. Rushing excitedly to pick it smiling from ear to ear because you've been having a great day. Coming to find out that someone being the Nazis are hunting down your family. Pretty depressing! Listening to the news makes you want to go looking for your family to be sure they are safe for now. Looking turns into searching. Searching turns into wondering. Wondering will make you just that much more nervous.

Redshirts,0765316994,John Scalzi,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"I have an inherent fondness for Scalzi books. He and I share a similar sense of humor and of drama. Redshirts is a great example of what I'm talking about here. This is a darkly humorous book, somewhat of a send-up of Star Trek, but told from the point of view of the ""redshirts"" of the crew, those extras whose sole job it is to die horrible deaths so that we know our heroes are in danger. In this case, the protagonists of the book are newly graduated cadets of a Universal Union who all score the most prestigious posting in the Fleet, the Intrepid. As far as they know, they live in a normal universe, leading relatively normal lives. They bond over drinks in the space station bar before the shuttle takes them to their new home. Once aboard the Intrepid, they start to notice that things are very odd there. Whenever the Captain, the Science Officer, the Engineer, or any of the other ""main cast"" crew members are walking down the corridor, all of the other crew members suddenly find reasons not to be found. Our protagonists discover why, as they go on ""away missions"" and barely survive. As they talk with other crew members (once they survive their ""initiation""), they discover that for some reason, the rules of physics and statistics are severely bent out of shape in the presence of the ""main cast"" officers.

There were a few editorial oversights with mixed up names and such. I can generally overlook that, but it was jarring this time. Also, some of the names of the protagonists are visually similar and it took me a while to sort out which backstory belonged to which character. But the biggest complaint I had with the novel was that it seemed to end too soon. I don't mean the book was short; I mean that it felt like one of those TV shows where everything looks like it's wrapped up neatly but you still have fifteen minutes to go, so you expect that there's some big twist that's just about to happen to make the story that much more interesting. This novel seems to set up such a big twist, but then suddenly ends. It was disappointing because that apparent big twist had such potential.

After the main story ends, the book has three ""codas"", extensions of the main story with characters that were featured in the main story but were not the main characters. Each of these codas were interesting additions to the story in very unique ways. The first coda is a first-person narrative told in blog/epistolary form. The second coda is written in second-person, a very unusual and difficult style that rarely works. This time I thought it did, exploring the thoughts and feelings of someone who has been told he was in a terrible accident with severe brain damage, and is trying to account for a couple of weeks missing from his memory. Finally, the third coda is in... you guessed it, third person, which tells the story of an actor who learns how profoundly and positively affected someone was by her portrayal of a bit part character, someone who had all of a couple of minutes of screen time. It's sweet and perfectly caps a story line from the main story."
Redshirts,0765316994,John Scalzi,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"It should be said that your enjoyment of this book will likely hinge on being, at least in some small way, a fan of classic Star Trek. And in poking fun of the same old tropes, it uses them all, some repeatedly. I was left wondering if I would have gotten more enjoyment from a standard episode of the show than I did this satirical send up. But that probably says more about my personal tastes than the quality of Mr. Scalzi's work. All in all, it was quite enjoyable."
Redshirts,0765316994,John Scalzi,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"Great concept, funny enough, decently told. Way too short (especially for the money). Ironically, in a book about how extras are abused for ease of writing, nearly all the characters are as forgettable as Security Guard #2."

Several years after the events in Halfway to the Grave, half-vampire Catherine ""Cat"" Crawford is still trying to adjust to her life without her all-vampire lover, Bones. The years training her team of special agents to be top notch vampire killers have kept her busy, but it hasn't been enough. And suddenly Cat is beset by constant attempts on her life. This time, they're coming from both sides: the living and the undead. And the only way to stay alive long enough to find out who's behind the attempts is to rely on Bones. The only real question is will she be able to walk away again?
One Foot in the Grave does a good job of developing the characters from the first book. The emotions are harder hitting, the humor is even better, and some interesting revelations about Cat's heritage are discovered. A definite must read for fans of the first book."

"Hunger (Gone, #2)",0061449067,Michael  Grant,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"All the adults are gone along with everyone over the age of fifteen. Chaos has begun. Kids are dying, starving, and suffering from there own stupidity. Here in the FAYZ Sam is the only ""adult"", the only parent to a bunch of ungrateful, ignorant children, children who would rather fight over who stole whos candy bar than survive. Sam can't keep pretending everything is okay, and he can't stand being expected to have all the answers. Along with the pressures of trying to survive in a world doomed to perish, Sam must also deal with the fact that some of the kids are developing powers, becoming mutants that can cook you from the inside out and defy gravity. Perdido Beach is dividing into freaks and normals.
     Hunger is something new and exciting that not only captures what life in the FAYZ is like, but also enters the mind of an adolescent, because it doesn't matter if you've been confined in a giant bubble for months, or not, you're still just a teenager. Short, choppy sentences give Hunger suspense and a sense of actuality that will keep you awake and entertained as it captures the insecurity and temptation that comes with being a teenager. Each and every character has a story to tell, from a love interest to a creepy voice inside their head telling them to do horrible things.               
     Grant's novel is unbelievably graphic, from the way he writes of young children murdering one another to stories of excruciating pain and torture. Michael Grant has yet again written a page turner I would recommend for anyone with a strong stomach looking for a little romance and a lot of action. He has created an even more horrific Gone."
"Hunger (Gone, #2)",0061449067,Michael  Grant,Barnes and Noble,4.5,readtolive_livetoread,"HUNGER doesn't shy away from venturing into pretty disturbing territory, starting right in the first chapter. One of Drake's plans halfway through the book is particularly vile. This is a YA book, but it never feels like the material is watered down. Sam exploits an alcoholic kid to get him to work, and a lesbian girl warns Sam that the divisions between ""freaks"" and ""normals"" are inevitable, based on her personal experience (kudos to Grant for tackling this subject). Enjoyed gone and waited for this book to come out. it was great to see how sam is struggling with the responsibility of being in charge. It made him seem more human. That's one thing that makes this book so interesting. Grant makes his characters more real, not just static characters that have superpowers. There is depth to them. Not only are they kids struggling against each other and this barrier that has trapped them, but they also are struggling within themselves. Not that the idea of these kids stranded inside the fayz isn't interesting, but making the characters more real adds to the interest."
"Hunger (Gone, #2)",0061449067,Michael  Grant,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Aschaef,"I loved this book. I accidently picked up the first one at my friends house, when I realized my mistake. It was too late. I was hooked. Sam Temple is a young teen age boy is thrown from being a carefree, surfer teen into being an responsible adult in only a second. You will laugh, cry, and cheer for the characters with every page that you turn. In this book Sam's growing continues. Mr. Grant does a great job with adding the peer pressure, lust, and self insecurity that comes with being a teenager into every character. I highly recommend this book if you love adventure, suspence, romance, and the legendary fight between good and evil. I personally can't wait till Mr. Grant pops out another fantastic book, and neither should you."

The writing since #11 has been uninspired in whole with some redeemable moments scattered throughout.  I've stopped purchasing the books and just wait for my turn at the library.
"Fearless Fourteen (Stephanie Plum, #14)",0312349513,Janet Evanovich,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Guest,"Janet Evanovich did not live up to the high expectations she has set with the precious Plum books.  The chemistry between the charecters is a thing of the past.  Ranger was hardly seen and Morelli was trying to remember if he slept with his cousin the whole book.  I thought these books were set in Jersey not Alabama.  Lula and Tank, while providing a bit of comis relief had an extremely far fetched storyline, even moreso than usual.  The whole engagement thing seemed very out of the blue.  Over all Fearless Fourteen was a sad disappointment when compared with previous efforts. Evanovich needs to bring back the spark and witty conversation that we have come to expect.  Especially between Ranger and Stephanie."

"Revolution 2020: Love, Corruption, Ambition",8129118807,Chetan Bhagat,Barnes and Noble,4.5,SarikaP8 on LibraryThing,"REVOLUTION  2020 REVIEWFrom Five Point Someone to Revolution 2020, Chetan Bhagat is- as Times Of India rightly puts it- the rockstar of Indian publishing. Revolution 2020 is going the be the new 'brand' of the Indian youth. The story, set in Varanasi, one of the holiest places in the country, considered to be the destination to go to get rid of your sins, is absolutely practical, definitive and gripping. It is the tale of Gopal, Raghav and Aarti who are childhood friends and even though they set out to find their own place in the world, their destinies are intertwined with that of one another and also with that of their own beloved city. The tagline of the book- Love, Corruption, Ambition suit the characters perfectly well. Aarti is the typical Indian girl who has the dream of becoming an air- hostess and yet cares a lot for her family and friends. The daughter of a District Magistrate and the grand- daughter of an MLA, her life is already on the threshold of getting political. Aarti, however, does not consider herself one of those people who would go about raising their hand and participating in election campaigns. Her life revolves around her two friends, Gopal and Raghav. Gopal being her best friend, she shares a special relationship with him with lots of on- again off- again signals coming from her side. Gopal talks about her 'natural maternal instincts'. She is there for both of her friends, whether they need her or not. The best thing about her is her belief that one must do what one loves to do and follow one's heart.Raghav, in my opinion, is what every young Indian should be. A true radical reformist, Ragahv believes that the country will change only when we begin grass- root level change. Even though he completes his engineering from a prestigious college, he discovers that his true passion is journalism. He puts immense efforts in bringing news to the people as it is, in its correct from. After being fired for writing about corruption and politicians involved in scams, Raghav starts his own newsprint 'Revolution2020'. This is where everything starts. From helping poor farmers to providing a clean environment, Raghav attacks it all. He will have a special place in the readers' hearts for just being who he wants to be.Gopal, our main hero or villain or as Chetan Bhagat rightly puts in the end- ""I'll let the readers decide how they want to consider you. I simply write about people. I don't cast them as heroes or villains."" Really, it is for the reader to decide whether Gopal is the hero or the villain. Coming from a poor family, one cannot help but feel sympathy towards him. He is what ever Indian farmer's child is- born in debt. His father works hard to get loans for his education and Gopal disappoints not only his father, but also himself. It is but obvious that when Gopal gets an opportunity to start off the path of becoming rich, he takes it without looking back. And there you have it, within a few years, Mr. Gopal Mishra is the director of a brand new college, where students idolize him. What more could he have asked for? The only factor that binds the childhood friends together, Gopal is truly a significant character. He believes that no matter what, we will never loose the 'Keshav' or the innocence and goodness that is there within us.One of the other characters who really caught my attention was MLA Shukla. He is the epitome of the Indian politician, 'I will arrange for it' being his favourite sentence throughout the book. A father figure and mentor to Gopal, Shukla also is a good person, only if that is what you want to believe. The faculty of Gopal's college 'GangaTech' as also the people involved in its establishment play a very significant role in the book.Somewhere in this entire scam and corruption scenario, the entire concept of Varanasi being the place to get rid of your sins hits you in the face, making you think that maybe the reason behind the backdrop being Varanasi is the clearance of our sins.

"A Bear Called Paddington (Paddington, #1)",0007174160,"Michael Bond, Peggy Fortnum",Barnes and Noble,4.4,HomeSchoolBookReview,"Through the years when our boys were younger, we checked out various single-story Paddington Bear books from the library to read to them. I thought that I had done a review of one of these previously, but apparently not.  Several years ago, while looking for some books to give as a present to our younger son Jeremy for his eighth birthday, I saw this original Paddington Bear book, in which Paddington Bear arrives from darkest Peru, where his Aunt Lucy had to move into a home for retired bears, and is found by Mr. and Mrs. Brown at Paddington Station, and a sequel, Paddington at Large (1962) in a book store and purchased them. At first, I thought that perhaps some of the single stories had been collected together.
      However, I have since found out that Bond originally wrote these collections, along with some ten or eleven others (More About Paddington, which we found and read later, Paddington Helps Out, Paddington Abroad, Paddington Marches On, Paddington at Work, Paddington Goes to Town, Paddington Takes to TV, Paddington Takes the Test, Paddington on Stage, and Paddington's Storybook), and the single story books were adapted from them.  I do not know how available the books are. I knew I had seen one in a bookstore somewhere. When I went to Borders, they did not have any, could not find them in any other of their area stores, and said they normally did not carry them in stock. I did find single copies of the two books under review at Barnes and Noble. They are delightful stories, obviously written to appeal to young children but enjoyable for anyone.  Jeremy said that they were great."
"A Bear Called Paddington (Paddington, #1)",0007174160,"Michael Bond, Peggy Fortnum",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Prince_Cor,"This book is simply wonderful. It is the first book in a series about a most remarkable bear. In this book we are introduced to the Browns. Mr. and Mrs. Brown are at a railway station -- Paddington Station -- in order to pick up their daughter Judy, who is arriving from her boarding school.

It is in this station where they spy a small bear, who has emigrated from Darkest Peru. The Browns, while recognizing the situation is highly irregular, nevertheless decide to take Paddington home with them. And so begins a very funny series of adventures involving the Browns (a caring, polite, and reserved family) and Paddington.

This edition of the book is beautiful. The paper is cream color, of fine quality and texture. The illustrations are beautiful. The layout welcoming.

If you have met Paddington before, or are new to Paddington, I believe you will find spending time with him and the Browns most rewarding. Just a refreshing, entertaining, and ever-so-proper book!"
"A Bear Called Paddington (Paddington, #1)",0007174160,"Michael Bond, Peggy Fortnum",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"When a young bear wearing an old coat and hat, named Paddington is left to fend for himself after his aunt is put into a home for old bears, the Brown family decides to take him in.  We follow the adventures of Paddington as he adapts to life with the Browns in England.  Paddington is taken by the Browns to get clothing and ends up making a mess in the display window. Paddington learns how to eat like a human and walk like a human.  Paddington gets in trouble one day in a train station and is band from the station.   Paddington starts to learn how to live in a world full of humans. Finally Paddington starts to fit in!	  	This book is so exciting because Paddington is such a cute loveable little bear, which just can¿t help but get into trouble! Every chapter is a different adventure for Paddington, such as him becoming a celebrity on the beach or him learning how to draw and making a big mess! Paddington is a lovely little bear that looks like any ordinary little stuffed animal, but he can come alive. Paddington never takes off his coat or hat, even when the hat fell over his eyes and he thought the power went out. Paddington always tries to do the right thing, but something always seems to go wrong. Paddington is a funny little bear. This book will never make you stop laughing."
"Flawless (Pretty Little Liars, #2)",0060887338,Sara Shepard,Barnes and Noble,4.5,C_B,"I thought Flawless was a really good book. It refreshes your memory from the first book, Pretty Little Liars, very well. The author gives you kind of a summary of what happened n the first book before each even with each person occurs. Sometimes the book is a little hard to follow because of all the different characters and stories each of them have. But, I think that is one of the things that make it so good. There are also a lot of unexpected events that occurred and made this book very good. It was hard to even put it down. There is also a lot of mystery in this book. Spencer, Aria, Hanna, and Emily all get strange texts, IMs, and emails from a person named A who claims to know everything about them; even their deepest and darkest secrets. Like, what really happened on the night of the Jenna Thing, what Spencer's dad really does at ""work"", and who Emily and Aria really like. The end is also very unexpected and interesting. Hopefully they are one step closer to finding out who A really is.

"Flawless (Pretty Little Liars, #2)",0060887338,Sara Shepard,Barnes and Noble,4.5,fieldhockeychikk,"Flawless and the whole Pretty Little Liars series are some of the best and suspenseful I've ever read. I finished this book in 2 hours (right after I bought it :p ) You never see any of it coming, and when you think you've got it all figured out the story turns on you and it's back to the drawing board. :) And the characters are well-defined, and you can really relate to them despite their uh, problems. If you haven't read this book already, go to Barnes & Noble RIGHT NOW. :)

The only thing I recommend for readers is do not, I repeat DO NOT go to the Pretty Little Liars website or the Wikipedia page on the series. Spoiler Alert!!! I found out everything up to the end of Unbelieveable when I was in the middle of Pretty Little Liars, so don't end up like me! lol :)"

"InuYasha: Turning Back Time (InuYasha, #1)",1569319472,Rumiko Takahashi,Barnes and Noble,4.8,Psychadelicm,"I really liked this idea to combine three volumes of the Inuyasha manga into one edition. There are many reasons why this was a good choice. The first would be because they made the book a bit larger which means the art is larger and clearer. The second would be the value of getting three volumes in one. And the third reason is that the original first three volumes were flipped to American (Western) style reading which means that one of the characters was no longer correct because of mirroring. This version has put it back to the original Japanese style correcting the aforementioned issue! Also, as an added bonus, there is a bonus art gallery at the end with the original full color cover art from the first three volumes. I also enjoyed how heavy it is and that the paper is much better quality than the individual manga volumes were printed on. All in all this is a must have for a true Inuyasha fan!"
"InuYasha: Turning Back Time (InuYasha, #1)",1569319472,Rumiko Takahashi,Barnes and Noble,4.8,beggar1015 on LibraryThing,"Kagome is a modern-day Japanese teenager who discovers she can travel back in time 500 years by jumping into an old well. Inuyasha is a half human/half demon with long hair and a short temper. He wants the powerful Shikon jewel in order to make himself a full fledge demon, but Kagome just happens to shatter the gem into a gazillion pieces. The two must now join up together to search for the shards of the jewel before they fall into the wrong hands.  Along the way they are joined by Shippo: a young fox demon (that I mistook for a female at first when I saw the anime of the show),Miroku: a lecherous Buddhist monk who is constantly asking women to bear his child, andSango: a demon slayer who's kid brother Kohaku has been brainwashed into working for the evil demon Naraku.  There's also Kikyo, a priestess that Inuyasha was in love with 50 years earlier. It just so happens that Kagome is the reincarnation of Kikyo. (Sounds confusing but if you read the series you'll understand.)  Sesshomaru is Inuyasha's older half brother, a full demon who is constantly trying to kill Inuyasha. But it's Naraku who is the main baddy of the series. He's also on the quest to gather the jewel shards and when he's not trying to kill Inuyasha he's trying to figure out his confused feelings for Kikyo because he too was in love with her fifty years ago. While Kikyo seems to be the object of everyone's affections, I personally don't like the character and wish she would die - again. See, she was dead but she was brought back to life and ...Just read the series. It'll all make sense."
"InuYasha: Turning Back Time (InuYasha, #1)",1569319472,Rumiko Takahashi,Barnes and Noble,4.8,Jenson_AKA_DL on LibraryThing,"This was a very cute one!  I've been watching the anime and am most of the way through the third season (I think) and since I keep seeing comments that the manga is even better, I decided to give it a shot. Much like in the anime 15 year old Kagome is pulled into the Bone Eater's Well by a horrific centipede (which is quite scary in the anime but not so bad in the manga) only to wind up in Feudal Era Japan.  There she sees the spell bound InuYasha stuck to a tree with an arrow and immediately goes to...fondle his ears LOL!  I loved it!I really do think I enjoyed this manga much better having seen the anime first.  The drawing isn't quite as appealing to me as some other manga I have read but it is interesting in an early Popeye looking sort of way.  Now that I've picked this one up and enjoyed it I think I'll have to pick up the other volumes (luckily my local library seems to have the full set).  Since my memory is so bad I can't rightly remember what happens with hair girl, whom we were left off with in this volume, so it will be a nice trip back."
The Omen,0451219422,David Seltzer,Barnes and Noble,3.3,sturlington on LibraryThing,"A fairly silly book. I'm sure it makes a better movie, as it reads like a novelization, without much to offer in the way of deep characterization, interesting plot or thrills other than the cheap variety."
The Omen,0451219422,David Seltzer,Barnes and Noble,3.3,Guest,"Its a wonderful book. I am looking to see if there is a book 2 to go along with it. I have seen the movies, but prefer to read the book."
The Omen,0451219422,David Seltzer,Barnes and Noble,3.3,Guest,"The Omen by David Seltzer is a thriller about the birth of the Anti-Christ.  Katherine Thorn who is the wife of U.S. ambassador Robert Thorn gives birth to a child, which unknown to her and her husband is killed by a priest who has gone over to the Devil¿s side  this was a gruesome killing as the priest used a rock to beat in the child¿s skull over and over again.  Robert Thorn arrives at the hospital and is met by another priest, Father Spiletto who informs him that his son died during child birth but rather than upset his wife he encourages him to take another infant whose mother had died during child birth.  Robert is torn at first saying he and his wife wanted to have their own, but after he looked at the baby boy with the thick black hair, deep-set blue eyes and the cleavage in his chin he saw how much the baby resembled both himself and his wife and he agreed to take the baby to his wife and present him as their son.  They named the baby Damien and soon the world around them changed.  Gory and gruesome deaths began to occur, Damien¿s nanny hangs herself at his birthday party, a priest is speared to death in a freak accident, a reporter is decapitated as a large pane of glass comes crashing down upon him.  Even animals are scared to death of Damien, at the zoo they run and hide when he comes near¿.Damien¿s parents realize that he is not a normal child that something is strange and eerie about him. It is finally realized that he is the child of the devil the Anti-Christ as predicted in the Bible in the Book of Revelations.  He has the sign of the devil on his scalp under his hair ¿666¿.    ¿Let He who hath understanding Reckon the number of the Beast: For it is a human number, Its number Six Hundred and Sixty Six¿ this quote from the Book of Revelations is what I believe this whole story is based around.  The ¿Beast¿ is the devil, the Anti-Christ.    Damien had been born in the sixth month of the sixth day during the 6th hour, 666.  He also had the sign of the beast on his scalp which was only uncovered when Robert Thorn shaved his head looking for the sign of the ¿Beast¿, there it was at the base of his scalp ¿666¿.  The priest who had killed the baby of Robert and Katherine Thorne also had the sign of the devil on his body, it was discovered after his death when he had been speared during a freak accident, which really was not an accident but caused on purpose by the devil himself.  The ¿666¿ symbol was  located in his groin area, was it put their by the devil or did he carve the numbers himself, either way once he realized that he had to return to God and tell Thorne the truth about Damien he was soon dead.  The only way to keep the Anti-Christ who had taken the human form in Damien was to kill him by stabbing him with the seven dagger of Meggido.  The seven daggers had to form the shape of the cross deep into his chest.  Did Robert Thorne carry this out, or did the son of the Anti-Christ win?  You will have to read this suspenseful book yourself to find out.  I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a book that keeps your nerves on edge and makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up.  Believer of the Bible or not, everyone¿s lives are based on choices of good or evil."

"Blue Moon (The Immortals, #2)",0312532768,Alyson Noel,Barnes and Noble,4.1,theReader278,I loved reading this wonderful book! It's even better than the first one in the Immortal Series. It is a story that keeps you entertained for hours.
"Blue Moon (The Immortals, #2)",0312532768,Alyson Noel,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"When I read Evermore, I have to admit that it was not my favorite book. I found the characters contrived, annoying, and completely unlikeable. The story was one we've all heard before: the young undying love of two teenagers with some kind of magical connection who would do anything for each other, blah blah blah. Twilight much? 
But, I decided to give Alyson Noel another chance and I read Blue Moon. I was disappointed to find Ever even more annoying and stupid than in the first book. She was often faced, in her opinion, with ""only one choice."" No, actually, there was always ANOTHER choice, usually the better one. But no, Alyson Noel wanted to set us up for the third book in the series with a whole new set of (unneccessary) problems. 
Even though a certain character has been obviously acting dodgy the whole book, Ever trusts them with healing Damen, her one true love? (Who, by the way, goes through a completely unrealistic character change. This is stretching it, even for fiction.) And then another character, who Ever knows from the beginning is bad news, she trusts with saving Damen? Even though we know, THE ENTIRE BOOK, that this character is trying to kill him. I mean really?!?!
Noel's characters are fake, and even though the author mentions again and again Miles and Haven are Ever's BFFs, they often treat her like dirt. And even Damen, who is supposed to be this perfect guy, does some pretty questionable things. Alyson Noel makes him ""astonishingly beautiful"" thinking that this automatically makes him likeable. Does Ever only love him for his looks? Because that's all she ever talks about. 
Don't get me wrong, as a teenage girl, I love all of the romance, and this series had potential to be good. But with so many elements that just aren't up to par, the Immortals Series falls short. But is literature so lacking and contrived these days that an author can't be original? Do we instead have to rely on the formulas we already know work? The rich boarding schools, vampires, and undying teenage love? And what's with the annoying heroines? We could use to smart, strong young women here! 
The Immortals Series is a quick read that one should read for fun. There are aspects of the series that I enjoy, but on the other hand, there are aspects that could DEFINATELY be improved. And though my review is mostly negative, I did find the book entertaining through parts, and I did finish it rather quickly. So I recommend this book as long as the reader goes into it only for fun, and not looking for actual substance."

"Child 44 (Leo Demidov, #1)",0446402397,Tom Rob Smith,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Janus,"Tom Rob Smith's debut is an excellent book. If I was able to, I'd give it 4.5 stars. Smith's plotting is dynamically executed and his prose is phenomenal. Not only did I find myself devouring the book, but I found that it has created a strong interest in literature of similar topics (specifically Stalinist Russia). Having studied the case which the novel is based off of, I can say that Smith did a good job tying the fictional to the facts. Now for my few gripes, and believe me, they are small. Despite the uniqueness of the characters and Smith's excellent portrayal of them, I never really connected to anyone. I really liked Leo, but it's challenging to relate to the types of characters that are in this book. Second, at times I felt like Smith was beating the whole 'see how tense it was in Stalinist Russia' thing to death. He kept reminding us of the things that did or didn't happen in such a paranoid state, and sometimes it was just too much. Lastly, the twist was a bit cliche. I believe it is Jasper Fforde who makes fun of the various stereotypical plot devices used by giving them numbers (i.e. ""looks like a plot device 27 to me sir""). Smith's twist was definitely a plot device number whatever, but by the time you find out, you don't care because the rest of the book is so enjoyable."

"The Devil and Miss Prym (On the Seventh Day, #3)",0060527994,"Paulo Coelho, Amanda Hopkinson, Nick Caistor",Barnes and Noble,4,cloggiedownunder,"2.5 stars

The Devil and Miss Prym is the third book in the On the Seventh Day series by Brazilian author, Paulo Coelho. It is translated into English by Amanda Hopkinson and Nick Caistor. As old Berta sits on her verandah watching, a stranger arrives in the town of Viscos, a man who comes to stay a week, and brings the devil. Chantal Prym, barmaid at the only hotel in town, is intrigued when the stranger wants to show her something in the woods. 

The gold bar buried near the Y shaped stone would let Chantal leave town and get on with a decent life. The other ten bars, hidden elsewhere, would ease the pressures on the town. All she has to do to have that gold bar is to tell the town they need to commit a murder by the end of the week. If they do it, they get to keep the ten bars. But Viscos is a town of good people: surely, they would not?

There you have it: a totally unrealistic premise used as a vehicle for debate on Good and Evil. Viscos is a conveniently small, isolated town full of older people, no children. The oldest resident, widow Berta has, conveniently, no family or friends, and is visited only by the ghost of her late husband. The youngest, Chantal is, conveniently, an orphan, completely unattached. The stranger is, conveniently, rich, powerful, tortured and believes himself to be a good man.

The story is filled with anecdotes: parables heavy on message, moralistic lessons lacking subtlety, hypotheticals built on an artificial situation. Good and Evil feature frequently, angels and devils play important roles. The characters are stereotypes. The whole thing is tedious and a bit clumsy."
"The Devil and Miss Prym (On the Seventh Day, #3)",0060527994,"Paulo Coelho, Amanda Hopkinson, Nick Caistor",Barnes and Noble,4,RebeccaScaglione,"&ldquo;The Devil and Miss Prym&rdquo; by Paulo Coelho one of the &ldquo;1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die.&rdquo;  Therefore, it was added to my own reading list.  I&rsquo;ve read &ldquo;The Alchemist&rdquo; by Coelho, and while I enjoyed it, I thought it got repetitive and I wasn&rsquo;t thrilled with the book.  I was, however, thrilled with &ldquo;The Devil and Miss Prym.&rdquo;

&ldquo;The Devil and Miss Prym&rdquo; is a book about a tormented man, being guided by the devil, who brings temptation in the form of wealth for murder in order to determine if people are inherently good or evil.  The man suffers from a horrific past and believes that if he completes his social experiment, he will be able to truly determine if humans are good or evil beings.  The man chooses the tiny city of Viscos, and opens up to Chantal, a barmaid with a promiscuous reputation and a dream about a more exciting future, about his plan to determine if people will murder for wealth and gold.

&ldquo;The Devil and Miss Prym&rdquo; is a great read that I highly recommend!  The book brings up some good moral questions and was a quick read.

Think about this: Would you commit murder in exchange for more money than you could ever spend?"

Paulo Coelho is also author of the world known book, the Alchemist. This book is very analytic and philosophical. Symbolism is a major component. This novel examines the question, ""are people bad?""

Set in a small town of the name Visco full of greed and selfishness, a young and desperate woman searching for a meaning is tempted by a man living in pain claiming to have the devil within him. She must take her ordinary life and choose between good and evil, listening to nature and also realizing she is responsible for her actions. Personally I believe that this book is amazing. It explores humans and their capacity to judge. Is there really and evil or is it just miss judgment? What makes a person capable of falling into temptation? What causes a person to be so ambitious and do actions that are not well accepted? Paulo Coelho takes all these questions and in the most simple manner clearly states his interpretations. The book leaves you stunned and like my friend would say, ""it blows your mind!!!"" This book focuses on a young woman by the name of Chantal Prym.

"Worth Dying For (Jack Reacher, #15)",0440339340,Lee Child,Barnes and Noble,3.9,harstan,"Since the mess in South Dakota (see 61 Hours), former Army MP Jack Reacher has hitched south to nowhere Nebraska.  Stopping for coffee, he gets involved with a drunken doctor and a nose bleed patient.  His desire to help thirtyish Mrs. Duncan who Reacher believes may be an abused spouse lands him in trouble with the woman's husband and his clan who own the county like terrorist despots.

The Duncan family distrusts Reacher as they await a special secret shipment that should have arrived by now.  Even as lethal as this clan is, they know their impatient customers are much more deadly than they are.  They call sniper Eldridge Tyler while the killer drives his granddaughter home.  Eldridge will be there to kill Reacher if he lingers in town as the only reason for him to do is to intrude on Duncan family business.

Worth Dying For is a direct follow up to the cliffhanging climax of 61 Hours so in spite of Lee Child providing a good backdrop, it behooves the audience to read the previous thriller first.  The story line is fast-paced from the moment Reacher forces the intoxicated doctor to look at the Duncan woman and never slows down.  Although this is a stop off on his way to Virginia, fans will enjoy the non-stop action as the hero appears to have out reached his survival skills.

"Worth Dying For (Jack Reacher, #15)",0440339340,Lee Child,Barnes and Noble,3.9,AuggieNS,"Lee's character, Jack Reacher, is a great recreation of an ex Military type, and his writing style makes all 15 of his books real page turners.  They make you want to read and keep reading and I'm looking forward to his next novel like a child waiting for Christmas. Just like Jason Bourne in the Ludlum novels, he is exceedingly bright and skilled in so many ways, and he has, at the same time, endearing sensibilities that make you feel his every vulnerability and root for his success.
Simply amazing writing...thanks so much Lee Child!!!"
"Worth Dying For (Jack Reacher, #15)",0440339340,Lee Child,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Bryan Brown,"Yes, it's more graphic than past Reacher novels. My opinion...the villains' actions warrant the actions and the ends justify the means. No matter what you think might happen, Child throws in his usual curve ball. My only complaint was the number of additional characters...sometimes a little hard to follow. Much better than 61 Hours."
Look Me in the Eye: My Life with Asperger's,0307395987,John Elder Robison,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"As a swim and triathlon coach for disabled kids, 'Look Me In the Eye', served as an eye opener for me. Reading John's story, of his uncontrollable, odd habits- nick-naming people he commonly was exposed to, blurting out at what could have been seen as the worst moments, avoiding eye contact at all costs, and digging holes, only to stick his younger brother into them, enabled me to better connect to my students and maybe from my work with them, I was able to better connect to the book. Being known as a ""social deviant"" though oddly intelligent, wasn't per say the correct classification for John, which one could conclude after reading the book. 'Look Me In the Eye - My Life With Asperger's' proved to be hysterically funny at times, though often a sense of dark humor, but was able to pull the strings to your emotions as well. The book follows John's life from his hilairious childhood to his diagnosis (which he didn't reach until the age of forty) with Asperger's sydrome (a form of autism) into his journey of creating a family of his own and following his dreams of building guitars for the band KISS. I really enjoyed this book, the connections which I was able to make to it, and its' ability to pull on my emotions yet make me laugh a few pages later. My only complaint is that the book drew out, and was a little bit slow and hard to get through in the middle pages. This book should definitely be read by anyone (like myself) whom works with disabled children, any parent, as well as any teacher. I've never read a book quite like this, and thus have no further recommendations but my overall rating of this book is excellent! Enjoy!"
Look Me in the Eye: My Life with Asperger's,0307395987,John Elder Robison,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"When I first learned that I had to read a nonfiction book as part of an English project, I was a little less than thrilled, as I generally do not enjoy nonfiction reading. However, I was actually a bit excited to read Look Me in the Eye, since I have an interest in the topic of psychological disorders. I thought that I would find the memoir of a man with Asperger's Syndrome to be quite interesting. As I read John Elder Robison's memoir, I realized that my prediction was correct. I was fascinated by the descriptions of his thought process, entertained by stories of his antics, and saddened by some of the recollections from his rough childhood. His memoir was truly an eye opener for me; it allowed me to get a taste of what it would be like to be inside the head of an Aspergian. Reading this memoir made me think about some of the things that the average person takes for granted, such as the abilities to hold conversations, make friends, and simply look people in the eye. People had the tendency to label Robison as a ""misfit"" when he was a child, because he did not posses the aforementioned abilities, though he eventually learned how to adapt to the norms of society. Nevertheless, he still felt eccentric throughout much of his life, up until the point of his diagnosis at the age of forty. Despite the fact that he had Asperger's, Robison was able to accomplish a variety of things in life that most ""normal"" people could only dream of doing. By the end of the book, I felt proud of him and his accomplishments and began to wonder if I've ever encountered an Aspergian. His memoir made me have a better appreciation for what I have now and a better understanding of people with disorders. I would definitely recommend Look Me in the Eye for anybody who has ever wondered what it would be like in the mind of someone with any kind of disorder. It's certainly an interesting read."
Look Me in the Eye: My Life with Asperger's,0307395987,John Elder Robison,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"An intimate and detailed emotional journey, `look me in the eye¿, is a well written, compassionate, deeply moving story that will have the reader laughing out loud on one page and on the verge of tears the next. Robison reveals what life was like growing up with an abusive, alcoholic father and his mentally ill mother. As a result of his inability to communicate appropriately, blurting out non sequiturs, and several other socially unacceptable behaviors, he was labeled a deviant. He found comfort with machinery. Dismantling and repairing various machines would lead to incredible employment opportunities, developing toys for Milton Bradley and guitars for the hard hitting rock group KISS and later for Pink Floyd. His life would be forever altered when, at the age of forty he was diagnosed with asperger¿s syndrome, a mild form of autism.    Look Me In The Eye is much more than a memoir or biography-- Robison lifts the curtain and shines an unflinching light on life with asperger¿s syndrome. Well written and original, this heartfelt journey is a fascinating and entertaining read that will remain with the reader long after the book is returned to the shelf.    Personally, I had only the briefest understanding of asperger's syndrome - however, this book has not only defined, with pinpoint accuracy the medical jargon, but the author allowed me a front row seat, with an unfiltered view of how his mind operates, the things that caused him difficulties and how he has learned to deal with each and made a comfortable life for himself and his family.   Stunning!    Happy Reading!"
Fantasy Lover (Dark-Hunterverse #1),0312979975,Sherrilyn Kenyon,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Xedra77,"I wasn't expecting a romance novel, despite the title, but that's what this was, an incredibly detailed and sexy romance novel.  If you've ever dreamed of having a man who loved you just the way you are and only wanted to pleasure you day and night, read on.

In case you haven't realized by now, this book is not for children.  It is a bit lacking in plot, especially when compared to Kenyon's later books in the series, but we can forgive her this first try and just enjoy the warmth of the story that is the meeting of Julian and Grace.

Grace is a bright young, self-concious woman with a debilitating history with sex and relationships.  In an attempt to make her move forward, a friend brings over a spell book that promises one month of bliss with the ultimate love slave.  Needless to say, Grace is less than convinced.  But the spell works and brings forth Julian, a demigod who has been trapped in the torture of the spell book for thousands of years.

This book is everything it promises to be and serves as a nice introduction to the entire Dark Hunter series."

Perfect Match,0743418735,Jodi Picoult,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"This is the first book I've found of Jodi's that isn't for the faint hearted. It was certainly a page turner.The story revolves around a little boy called Nathan, and his parents, his mum being a defence prosecutor or something like that. He's a happy toddler, who's speaking away, when suddenly he goes silent, grumpy, and uncooperative. His parents are desperately worried, and try slowly but surely to teach him sign language, and various trips to the doctors reveal in a shocking way that their precious son has been abused. Then he signs the word ""father"", at first making everyone around him think that his own dad had done it. Then it's revealed not to be him, but a Father, as in a priest.The story snowballs from there, where the mum takes matters into her own hands, and hands up being in the wrong section of the court she's used to. There are many twists & turns, and lots of scientific dialogue about DNA, bone marrow transplants - which went straight over my head - and eventually lead to what really happened.It is a harrowing story, and ultimately shocking. Sure, it is practically all set in a court, but for me, it is probably the best book yet by Jodi, as it's had a lasting effect on me. However, not something I read again. Definitely pick this one up first. But not for the faint hearted."
Perfect Match,0743418735,Jodi Picoult,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"Like all of Jodi Picoult's novels, this one was a great read. It was contriversal and made you relize that even things like murder have two sides, two storys and sometimes you can even feel bad for people who are forced to resort to murder. Even though some parts were somewhat unrealistic, the novel as a whole was great and made me think about some difficult topics."
Perfect Match,0743418735,Jodi Picoult,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Bookworm-42,"From the very first sentence, I was intrigued by the writing style of this author. But this book was different. It caused me, as a parent to take a long hard look at myself and question how far I would be willing to go to protect my child. Murder? I just don't know. But if you are not a parent, you could probably give an answer without hesitation. But this book shakes you to your core and that I love. I want to feel, I want to cry, I want to laugh. I want to be a little unsure of my feelings. This book made me think deeply, not just about the characters, but about myself. I saw a little of myself in many of the characters. This book is a must read and worth sharing in a book club."
Prep,081297235X,Curtis Sittenfeld,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Guest,"When I was reading the other reviews for this book, I was so happy to find that others didn't care for it either. I was completed dissapointed by this book, and the message that it was trying to send. The main character improves nothing in her life, she doesn't grow, and let others people ruin her life. There is really no climax in this book, and it seems to really have no point. Except maybe that some people like Lee are just cowardly, and choose to never improve their lives. How depressing. I finished this book only because I hoped that there would be a good ending....there wasn't. It's the first book I've ever thrown away. The one thing that drove me crazy about Lee, was that she let her long term crush, that idiotic boy  use her, and treat her terribly. The explicit sex scenes that were introduced into the story were not in anyway helpful to moving the plot along, or even helpful to Lee's opinion of herself. He continued to use her, and she let him, and I think it's important to acknowledge that his behavior was not acceptable. The author never acknowledged this. The people in this book made bad decisions, and seemed to continue to make them, thus destroying themselves. This is not a message that I think should be sent out to the public."
Prep,081297235X,Curtis Sittenfeld,Barnes and Noble,3.5,EvaGirl2006,"The main character of this book was very unlikable. I found myself waiting for something bad to finally happen to her. She walks all over people who are nice to her in the story. This basically sums up the book until the end when her character finally doesn't make you want to punch her or give you anxiety because she is so awkward. The supporting characters in the book are like-able and are what redeems the book. You feel sorry for them almost. In the end, the book was entertaining enough to get me to finish it. However, as a warning to those of you know prefer to like the main character, I wouldn't suggest this."

Scar Tissue,1401307450,"Anthony Kiedis, Larry Sloman",Barnes and Noble,4.6,Guest,"First and Foremost, Props to the Chili Peppers...Blood Sex Magic was apart of my college experience, and they command respect. With that said, I have a few observations. First, Anthony so desperately wants his readers to know what a ladies man he is. Why? I can understand writing about meaningful relationships and the effect they had on the author and his work, but in the end, my image of Anthony is weak and insecure for a couple of reasons: a) why does he feel so inclined to give such graphic detail to his sexual relations? I'm sure the women and their families really appreciated the detail. b) I grew tired and bored everytime he would say 'the second we meet I felt a connection and had to have her' or 'that was the most amazing sexual experience I ever had in my life'. Give me a break...these women come off as shallow party girls with starry eyes. Same old story as far as Rock Stars go. Your boy Jack Nicholson would never write a book detailing his sexual conquests, he has to much class and doesn't need the validation. I also find Anthony's attention to detail amazing when it comes to all his encounters with women, even though he was extremely loaded all the time, the verbal exchanges seem to be verbatum. I can barely remember the few encounters I had when I was young, and I'm only 32. And for those of you who feel that the redundant sexual detail are vital to the story, you're better off subscribing to Penthouse's Forum.     Despite my aggressive stance on his 'womanizing' I did find value and insight on his battle with the dark energy that comes with his lifestyle. Anthony was honest. Drugs are fierce, and there is a dark spirit out there waging war for your soul. I felt his desperation and hopelessness. Addiction is no laughing matter."

Alias Grace,3442723434,"Margaret Atwood, Brigitte Walitzek",Barnes and Noble,4.6,mstrust on LibraryThing,"Sixteen year old Grace Marks may or may not have helped commit the murders of her employer and his housekeeper. That she was there, that her kerchief was used to strangle one of the victims and that unknowing witnesses spoke to her after the crimes are all facts, but even a decade later Grace swears that she remembers little of what happened that day. Dr. Simon Jordan is sent to figure out if Grace is telling the truth, and their daily meetings to discuss the crime leads to more confusion and unhappiness for Dr. Jordan than for Grace.This story is based on an actual double murder that happened in the 1840's. Atwood has gathered as much information as possible and pieced together the rest while adding in some original characters. This is one of my best reads so far this year and I enjoyed it every bit as much as I enjoyed The Blind Assassin last year. Although the book title gives away some of the mystery, it ended so differently than I expected and really kept me guessing."
Alias Grace,3442723434,"Margaret Atwood, Brigitte Walitzek",Barnes and Noble,4.6,silenceiseverything on LibraryThing,"I bought Alias Grace about two years ago (for a dollar at a library sale...Those rock!) and have been putting it off ever since. I've heard from a few people that while Margaret Atwood is an amazing writer, her books weren't really page-turners. And, somewhat unfortunately, I almost always go towards page-turners in my pleasure reading. But I decided to read it because it has been on my bookshelf for much longer than it should've been. Well, I'm glad to say that my assumption of this book as a non-page-turner was way off base as Alias Grace was completely riveting! I absolutely could not put this book down. Even though I sort of knew that we weren't going to get a definitive answer on whether or not Grace Marks was actually the mastermind behind the murders or just a victim of circumstance (as this was actually never known in real life), I was still compelled to know how exactly the whole thing would be resolved. The resolution (and the ending) was what fell a little bit flat to me. It just seemed to cheesy and a bit abrupt. But at the same time, I'm having trouble coming up with a suitable ending that wouldn't have left me a bit disappointed. I think because Alias Grace was overall awesome, the ending was sort of destined not to live up to the brilliance of the novel. Regardless of the semi-flat ending, I highly recommend Alias Grace. It really was a brilliant character study on Grace Marks. Again, although we won't ever know Grace's part in the murders, the journey that Atwood takes us readers to is more than mesmerizing."
"Captivated by You (Crossfire, #4)",0425273865,Sylvia Day,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Anonymous,"I wish these Authors would leave a trilogy closed at the third book or sum up each story at the end of each book in a series that has multi characters. I find it hard to believe it takes 5 books to tell one story. I for one believe if you take something great and completely keep it going to make money, sooner or later you won't, you will instead infuriate the readers not to buy your books anymore. People waited a year for this just to find out they must buy another book to get to the end...really? Come on people are over it now."
"Captivated by You (Crossfire, #4)",0425273865,Sylvia Day,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Anonymous,"I ABSOLUTELY ADORED the first two book and found the third to be highly satisfying BUT then Sylvia Day got GREEDY. For this series should have ended with three books, NOT five! In my opinion Capitvated By You seems far too repeatative.  I mean how many times can the author describe how good looking both of the lead characters are? In the first three books the love scenes were hot, spicey, sensual, and adventurous. Now it seems like Sylvia Day copies and pastes each love scene from past written ones in this series, with the exception of the last sex scene between Gideon and Eva in Captivated by you.  Another problem I had was how Eva treated therapy as a cure all for their problems. It does not work for everyone. And I especially doubt Gideon's desire to even be in the same room as any therapist b/c of his past...which I TOTALLY understand and would share similar feelings of distate. So why can't Eva try to be understanding and NOT so selfish. Eva became too demanding in this book and when she didnt get her way she runs..like a child. The HIGHLIGHT of this book and an ABSOLUTE positive was that we finally got to hear Gideons POV. I could truly NEVER hear Eva's POV again and be satisfied b/c she NEVER says anything new. Spending WAY too much time talking about secondary characyers that i DO Not care abojt. I can only PRAY that Sylvia Day writes from Gideon's POV for the Last book as well! As I was actually VERY interested in his thoughts and feelings on matters, as well as getting an idea of how his brain works and what makes him tick? But Eva has steadily been declining since book three. So much so Im beginning to wonder what Gideon loves about her. My god I'd die to have myself a Gideon Cross! Sylvia Day needs to finish the series and stop trying to squeeze more money from people. She dragged this series out and b/c of it and I will NOT be buying anymore of her stories."

I am a huge fan of the series however the last book kind of irked me a little with the way it ended.  If I could give 2.5 stars I would. It was an ok book and actually the exact opposite of the last one. I honestly didn't like it until the last few chapters. I probably won't buy the next one unless it's cheaper. I'm not wasting my money on another one of these books that are just disappointing. It's the same problems over and over again. The same thing happening between Gideon and Eva fight, hate each other then have sex and forget all about it. Just disappointed in the direction this series has gone."

"Soulless (Parasol Protectorate, #1)",0316056634,Gail Carriger,Barnes and Noble,4.3,BBandReveries,"Alexia Tarabotti is the daughter of an Italian-making her tan, assertive, big-nosed, and curvy. Unlike her mother and half sisters, she also happens to be soulless (the preferred term being preternatural). After being attacked by a rove vampire, Alexia is forced to uncover the mystery behind recent vampire and werewolf disappearances. In doing so, her relationship with the alpha of the London werewolves, Lord Maccon, intensifies in every way. 
I loved this book. Gail Carriger does a fantastic job twisting the paranormal into steampunk Victorian England. This satire is filled with great characters, an interesting plot, and lots and lots of tea. The protagonist, Alexia Tarabotti was born a preternatural, or without a soul. By simply touching a vampire or werewolf, she can rid them of their supernatural abilities, or turn them human. This only works if she is physically touching them; as soon as she removes her touch, they are back to their supernatural state. Lord Maccon arrives right after Alexia kills her attacker with her parasol. He is a Scottish alpha werewolf who finds Alexia to be a pain in his-well, you know what I mean. Lord Maccon grows deeper feelings for Alexia-or rather, he comes to realize his deeper feelings for her throughout the first half of the novel. He is accompanied by his Beta, Prof. Lyall. Even though Prof. Lyall is a werewolf, he is the opposite of Lord Maccon. Where Lord Maccon is rude, primal, and a bit wild, Prof. Lyall is well-mannered, civilized, and tame. I loved Lord Maccon. I really enjoyed reading the banter between him and Alexia. 
The story is set in 19th century (steampunk) Victorian England. This novel had me laughing out loud. Alexia, like everyone else at that time, is obsessed with manners and proper etiquette. To her, the end of the world would occur when it ran out of tea. However, she does realize the absurdity of her family and how they judge others. Alexia's family reminded me so much of the Bennet family in Pride and Prejudice. There were also some similarities between Alexia and Elizabeth, not tons, but definitely some. 
I would highly recommend this book. Warning: there is a sex scene, kissing, some nudity, and a bit of blood."
"Soulless (Parasol Protectorate, #1)",0316056634,Gail Carriger,Barnes and Noble,4.3,MrsPeel,"I will be honest and say that the cover art drew me to this book, however, once I began to read I could not put the book down. Ms. Carriger has provided an ingenious alternative to the usual supernatural romance. It is a combination of period piece, supernatural romance and intriguing mystery all rolled up in one delightful book. The characters are FANTASTIC and all well developed -- Alexia Tarabotti, Lord Maccon, and especially Professor Lyall with his futuristic scientific know-how, and Lord Akeldama is charming and witty. I look forward to reading all of the Alexia Tarabotti, Parasol Protectorate series of novels."
"Just One Day (Just One Day, #1)",0142422959,Gayle Forman,Barnes and Noble,4.4,JAMQueen,"Do NOT READ this BOOK! At least not until the sequel comes out. This was by far the BEST of Ms. Forman's work I have had the privilege of reading thus far - I also read the if I Stay series. It is beautifully written and had me pining to continue through the journey with Allyson right up until the ending, which actually made me scream in frustration. Fans of the If I Stay series will probably recall the abrupt ending in the first book there, but without an idea that there will be a sequel that book at least gave me the feeling that I could decide how the characters ended up. THIS book, however, reaches the climax and just STOPS... it's like some form of agonizing emotional torture I've submitted myself to. 

The book starts off somewhat bland with Allyson being the &quot;good girl&quot; who gets frustrated by that label but does nothing to change it, that is until she meets Willem and makes the most impulsive decision of her life to run off to spend the day with him in Paris. Then things get good as the first 1/2 of the book details the ins and outs of that one day - with both highs and lows. It's not a perfect day, but it's the kind of day that makes you feel like something magical is happening. I found myself half in love with Willem by the end. When the day ends Allyson is left in a depression, she struggles for months afterwards until finally she realizes that she can't let that day go. So the second half of the book is Allyson struggle through the down of trying to be the same Allyson when she's outgrown who that was. She finally decides to find Willem again. 

The things that make this book so incredibly excellent are not only the growth in Allyson, which is will touch anyone who's ever realized that there might be more beyond that small box they've been living in. But more so this book is amazing because of the side characters both the friends that Allyson makes, the people who help her in small ways and even those who seem like enemies. This is the kind of book that makes you feel like people really are inherently good. Also that you should never jump to conclusions because you almost always miss something important if you do."
"Just One Day (Just One Day, #1)",0142422959,Gayle Forman,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Wolf_Girl21,"Such an amazing book! I liked her other books but wasn't completly in love with them so I hesitated before reading this one, but wow I'm so glad I decided to read it."
"Just One Day (Just One Day, #1)",0142422959,Gayle Forman,Barnes and Noble,4.4,TootsieRoll101,"** spoiler alert ** This book... I don't think I've ever read a book with such a good cliffhanger. Of course, I hated that cliffhanger, but nevertheless, it was a good cliffhanger.




Allyson reminded me of myself, with her goody two-shoes-ness. She was a really good character.




I loved this book, but at the same time I hated it. I started hating it at the end, just because I was unhappy with how the plot was unfolding. It seemed like Allyson would never, EVER see Willem again. And that would be just too... sad for me. 




I'm glad that this wasn't like Twilight, in which Bella went into depression about Edward leaving her; Allyson went into depression because she lost who she really was. And the person who brought out who she really was was Willem.




I was disappointed with Melanie and Allyson's outcome. If I were Allyson, I would be a bit more sad about their relationship ending, but of course, it wasn't part of the main plot.




I got a bit angry with Ms. Foley (I think that's what her name was) when she said that Willem just wanted her for the sex and watch, but I saw that she was right in a way. Willem was a player, and there was no denying that once we discovered more information on Willem when Allyson visited Amsterdam. But, despite what I just said before, I think Willem really... maybe... I don't know... loved Allyson.




There. I said it. 




Maybe he just 'fell in love' and he wasn't 'in love, but I think he did love her. Or at least, he cared about her.




I was a bit surprised on how quickly they 'did it' together, as they only knew each other for a day, but it wasn't like they were... nevermind. 




I felt so... bad when I saw Willem with the ginger girl. It was like, how could you Willem? I trusted you! I LOVED YOU! 




But then again, a year had passed. Willem, being the player that he is, probably forgot all about Allyson. But he could have also just wanted to get his mind off things. He DID remember Allyson.




Ha! I loved the last few paragraphs of the book.




He gasped when he saw her. HE GASPED!!!!!!!!!! When I read those words, my heart was filled with hope. I'm a sucker for sweet, fluffy romance stories, and that moment was so... I congratulate Forman for putting that in there. It's perfect. He gasped. When he saw her he GASPED. 




GASP! 




Being the sucker that I am for fluffy romance stories, I was unpleasantly disappointed when the book ended so quickly.




Of course, I see that Forman would continue it in the next book, but that means I'll have to wait!!!! 




&quot;'Hi Willem,&quot; I said. &quot;My name is Allyson.'




He says nothing in response. He just stays there for a minute, looking at me. And then he steps to the side, opens the door wider, wide enough for me to walk through.




And so I do.&quot;




It's so... unfinished. :( 




I definitely CANNOT wait until the next book comes out.




Basically this book is split into three parts. One third is about love. One third is about Allyson being in depression. One third is about her trying to find him.








But it was great. And I loved the Shakespeare references, especially the one that Willem told the cop that pulled them over for riding on the bicycle illegally. It was perfect."
"Wake (Wake, #1)",1416953574,Lisa McMann,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"This book was ok. Not great. Not bad either. It started slow, didn't seem to catch my attention until probably about half way through. Based on the synoposis I was expecting a suspenseful book that would leave me afraid if I read it at night by myself. This is NOT the case. It seemed to be more about relationships, but kept light. She has a secret, she sees the dreams of those around her as they sleep. She tries to keep it a secret and is attempting to navigate life and relationships despite her ""disability"". There is some action, but not suspense. McMann didn't generate in me a lot of emotion for her characters. In fact, I felt indifferent, not really interested in reading any more of their story in the sequel, Fade. However, I decided to read it anyway since I didn't have any other books in mind. Surpisingly, I found Fade to be MUCH better and I actually enjoyed it. I only recommend this book because Fade is worth the read, and you need to know what happens in Wake to get to Fade. But as a stand-alone book I would not recommend it."
"Wake (Wake, #1)",1416953574,Lisa McMann,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"Adolescents beware: Lisa McMann knows you. She knows your insecurities. She knows how you might look so together, yet be so screwed up.This is why Wake rang so true for me--because I remember what it was like to be 15, 16, 17. It wasn't a lovely, dreamy existence; it was somewhat akin to living in a shark tank.So I can relate to Janie's fear that she's a freak. It makes sense; she slips into other people's dreams, after all. Nasty, nasty dreams. Makes it kind of hard to look a friend in the eyes, when you've seen him beating his father to a pulp.As an adult, I can also relate to Janie's dismissal of adults. She has yet to learn that we're all just older teenagers. So when McMann skillfully adds a touch of mystery, now and then, to the actions of Janie's miserably inept mother, I love it. Funny stuff. Well written story. Scary stuff. Surprisingly believable fantasy stuff.I highly recomment this one."
"Wake (Wake, #1)",1416953574,Lisa McMann,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Selina_Jonas,"I could NOT put this book down! i actually did not put it donw until i was finished! it was absoulutley amazing! i was not sure i was going to like it at first, but as soon as i finished it i went out and bought 'Fade'. This book absolutley is a definite re-read because i thought it was that great. Many of my friends and even some teachers asked if they could borrow it. It is truelly an amazing read."
The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer,1439107955,Siddhartha Mukherjee,Barnes and Noble,4,Kratz,"I heard the author on Public Radio and purchased the Nookbook. It is an excellent history of cancer and cancer research that strips away much of the mystery of the disease. I found it compelling and not difficult to read. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has cancer or knows someone struggling with the disease. This is not a how-to book on comforting those with cancer. This is a book that gives knowledge on how the disease exists in the body and the challenges that lie ahead in defeating it. ""The Emperor of All Maladies"" not only contains facts but passion in fighting cancer and compassion in treating it. A must read."
The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer,1439107955,Siddhartha Mukherjee,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"As a young physician, it was fascinating to hear about a disease that continues and will continue to haunt the human race.  Towards the end, the pathways bit might be too much for a lay reader, but overall this is a fantastic book and will hopefully inspire some to cure cancer or to be at least cured."
The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer,1439107955,Siddhartha Mukherjee,Barnes and Noble,4,Mystiflyer,"Maybe I loved it because I've been diagnosed with cancer and wanted to know more, but I couldn't put this book down.  To me, it read like a who-done-it.  It answered so many questions for me -- even questions I didn't know I had until I began reading.  It gets very technical at times, but its written so that it is still understandable.  Very well done."
"Glass (Crank, #2)",1416940901,Ellen Hopkins,Barnes and Noble,4.6,JHM_2010,"After reading the first page of Glass, you won't want to put it down. It takes you through the life of Kristina Snow and her meth addiction. To get the full concept of Glass you might want to read Crank first. Crank is the first book about Kristina and her addiction and how it all started. The more you read the more you are wanting to figure out what happens next. Ellen Hopkins describes Kristina's life with such vivid details that you can't help but love it. Glass really shows you how big of an affect drug addiction has on someones life and the troubles that it causes. Many teenagers will be able to relate to some of the other things that occur in the book. Glass really makes you have a new outlook and makes you want to stick to your dreams and not mess them up. Glass is my favorite book by Ellen Hopkins, I highly recommend reading it if you enjoy her books, you won't be dissapointed."
"Glass (Crank, #2)",1416940901,Ellen Hopkins,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"Kristina thinks she has a control over crack. Now with a baby to care for, she's determined to be the one in control. But the monster is too strong, and before she knows it, Kristina is back in its grips. She needs the monster to keep going, to face the pressures of every day life. Once the monster has control over Kristina, she'll do anything for it, including giving up the one person who gives her unconditional love; her baby.GLASS is the sequel to CRANK. This story continues the tale of Kristina and how the drug ends up controlling her life.Gritty and raw, this tale shows the effects crack has on an individual and their love ones. Ellen Hopkins does a great job of taking us on this painful trip that was loosely based on her own daughter's experiences with the monster.This is a haunting tale that will stay with the reader.I'd highly recommend this book to those who know loved ones in the grip of the monster. Even though Kristina loses her way, the reader can't hope that maybe she'll be able to climb out of the abyss--back to her family and to her son, Hunter. Well written. I recommend this one too."
"Glass (Crank, #2)",1416940901,Ellen Hopkins,Barnes and Noble,4.6,MicheleLeesBookLove,"Reviewed for Monster Librarian as part of Banned Books Week

	Glass is the direct follow up to Crank, which starts with Kristina Snow after she's had her baby, kicked meth and nicotine and shortly before her eighteenth birthday. It follows her relapse in her struggle with the meth monster and goes farther than Crank imagined. Sharp and painful Glass is hard to read. For one Kristina seems to not even care that she'd making such horrible mistakes. Almost on autopilot in her quest to fill simple needs, reader with more than once want to reach into the lines and try to shake some sense into her.
	While Crank goes very far to combat drug use as an introductory tale, Glass is Anti-Drug 201, a hardcore look at more of the nasty side effects of addiction, as good as an uncut marathon of Intervention with viewers thrust, uncomfortably, inside Kristina's head. There's no doubt it will be too much for many readers, either too brutal, or too close to home. But Hopkins savagely slices through any illusions of ""normal life"" with beautiful poems and style that make the story she's telling all the more monstrous. Highly recommended for collections, but with the warning that these pages might leave reader's scarred.

	Contains: sex, drug use, language, domestic violence"
"Only Time Will Tell (The Clifton Chronicles, #1)",031253955X,Jeffrey Archer,Barnes and Noble,3.8,DeborahMO,"I am not completely finished with this book, but just had to add my review so that those who may be hesitating because of the Nook price of $14.99 will decide to read it anyway. Absolutely one of my best books of the year so far. I am so very glad that this is a series. Don't you hate it when a book you love ends, knowing there is no continuation ahead? I do."
"Only Time Will Tell (The Clifton Chronicles, #1)",031253955X,Jeffrey Archer,Barnes and Noble,3.8,BookaholicTracy,I enjoyed reading this book. Very entertaining and intelligently written.
"Only Time Will Tell (The Clifton Chronicles, #1)",031253955X,Jeffrey Archer,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Elle_Wilvee,"I really enjoyed this book, the writing was simple and straight forward; it's the plot and characters that draw you in. I finished the book in only a few sittings, the last one keeping me up until 1 in the morning because I had to find out what happened to Harry.

My only criticism would be the strange way the author keeps changing the point of view. I enjoyed having different sections focusing on different characters, but I don't think the first person point of view chapters really added anything to the story and at first they only confused me. They also don't really sound different enough to be believable.

Overall, an enjoyable quick read and I'm excited for the next in the series.

I won this book through Goodreads FirstReads."
The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success: A Practical Guide to the Fulfillment of Your Dreams,1878424114,Deepak Chopra,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success is easy to read and the wisdom that it contains is presented in a format that makes understanding the laws effortless. I enjoy each time I read it.
""Success in life could be defined as the continued expansion of happiness and the progressive realization of worthy goals. Success is the ability to fulfill your desires with effortless ease. And yet success, including the creation of wealth, has always been considered to be a process that requires hard work, and it is often considered to be at the expense of others. We need a more spiritual approach to success and affluence, which is the abundant flow of all good things to you. With the knowledge and practice of spiritual law, we put ourselves in harmony with nature and create with carefreeness, joy, and love."" ~ Deepak Chopra from ""The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success""

The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success: A Practical Guide to the Fulfillment of Your Dreams,1878424114,Deepak Chopra,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,I studied this book in the alcohol & drug treatment facility that I went through and I continue to do so. I read this book more than I read the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous. Thats saying a lot. It's a great book.
The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success: A Practical Guide to the Fulfillment of Your Dreams,1878424114,Deepak Chopra,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"I have to admit. I read this book many years ago and just didn¿t get it¿ it simply didn¿t resonate with me at the time. About 2 weeks ago I was looking for something to read before bedtime and for some reason, this book seemed to jump off of my bookshelf¿ so I figured I¿d give it a second chance.     Now I¿m guessing that you¿ve probably heard the saying that when the student is ready, the teacher will appear¿ holy cow¿ this was my experience with this book! This time around, I got it¿ big time! I found myself studying it like a manual for my life. Consciously focusing on one of the spiritual laws each day of the week¿ as the author suggests at the end of the book.    So without spoiling the book for you by revealing all that I¿ve gotten and continue to get from it, let me just highly suggest that you pick this book up and give it a shot. And if it doesn¿t resonate with you yet, that¿s okay¿ just continue on your path to enlightenment and who knows, maybe somewhere down the road you¿ll pick it up again and it will impact you like it has me."
Magical Thinking: True Stories,0312315953,Augusten Burroughs,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Hud16,"I loved Augusten Burroughs' ""Magical Thinking"". A group of short essays jumping in time from childhood to recent adult activities, it has a similar feel to Rikki Lee Travolta's ""My Fractured Life"" (although with the huge difference that ""My Fractured Life"" is fiction and ""Magical Thinking"" is a memoir). Just like ""My Fractured Life"", in ""Magical Thinking"" the writing was crisp yet naturally meandering - like a conversation. Some of the stories are a bit sexually graphic so it is not for the easily offended, but I thoughly enjoyed the honesty. Five stars!"

"Shadowland (The Immortals, #3)",031259044X,Alyson Noel,Barnes and Noble,4.1,EmSTL,"Alyson Noel has officially lost me as a reader with her release of the latest story in the Immortals series.  Noel has successfully destroyed any likable qualities of her main character, Ever.  Where Ever was once a naive, misguided, guilt-ridden teenage girl who, especially after Blue Moon, you feel sorry for, she has now crossed over to utter idiocy...incapable of learning from her past mistakes, pathetic in her lack of any inkling of intuition or common sense, frustratingly full of herself and displaying such arrogance in her ""powers"" that one cannot help but feel she's gotten exactly what she deserves and all pity rests with those unfortunate enough to be connected to her and thus suffer her consequences.  I really wanted to like this author and her series...first thoroughly enjoying Evermore, then feeling unsure after reading the melodrama of Blue Moon, but still willing the author to redeem herself with Shadowland.  Sadly, it wasn't even close.  It's almost amazing to me that an adult wrote this series...so focused on appealing to the shallow, commercialized, morality lacking, dumbed down current generation of pre-teens and teens.  Bottom line, this series is truly not meant to go beyond the 12-15 year old segment of the Young Adult market."
"Shadowland (The Immortals, #3)",031259044X,Alyson Noel,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"I loved both Evermore and Blue Moon; I couldn't wait for this book to come out. But I was a little disappointed. Everything was happening so fast and all at one time. And Ever was a little selfish in this book and a little snobby. She's the reason all these problems are arising and she takes the blame for them but then she makes remarks about being angry things aren't being resolved as fast as she wants them. And really the ending doesn't solve anything. All the problems are still the same in the end, nothing gets solved. WILL THE GIRL EVER LEARN? Hadn't she already made enough mistakes and she just ignores everything everyone says and does the things she wants anyways, which tends to lead her to much more problems before she's even fixed the last one. It was wonderfully written but I felt it was unfinished, the book is titled Shadowland and yet it only talks about it one or two times. As I said nothing gets solved and some things aren't even explained. Definitely disappointed!"
"Shadowland (The Immortals, #3)",031259044X,Alyson Noel,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"Holy crap. That's all I have to say. Alyson Noel does not know how to make Ever a smart character! I loved the first book, Evermore, Blue Moon wasn't too bad, but Shadowlands was depressing! Ever cannot make a right decision and listen to the people she truly loves...it is frustrating. I just hope Dark Flame, her next book, will be better."

"Lioness Rampant (Song of the Lioness, #4)",0689878575,Tamora Pierce,Barnes and Noble,4.5,SeeMichelleRead,"Upon receiving this last book in Tamora Pierce's fabulous Song of the Lioness quartet, I must admit I was worried. Okay, not truly worried, but nervous that Pierce wouldn't be able to address my many questions and thoughts properly in this last book. Then I noticed the book was over 400 pages and I knew Pierce had given herself plenty of space to discuss each facet of Alanna's story in the detail it deserved. I was not disappointed - shame on me for even doubting.

Alanna of Trebond, the only female Knight of Tortall, has achieved her dream. She has gained her knights shield, she has had numerous adventures, and her fame with sword and magic have spread all over the country. I just loved it when everyone is talking about how the little girls in the streets play ""Alanna and Duke Roger!"" Let's hear it for female role models! But her Gift keeps warning her that all is not right with her friends in beloved Tortall. In order to save Tortall from dissension and sorcery, Alanna must obtain the Jewel of Dominion, the one thing that, if used wisely, can have great power for good. Several of Alanna's old enemies resurface (ones I had thought were gone for good) are they prove to be more deadly and conniving than ever and it will take everything Alanna and her friends have to combat these old foes.

Alanna's faithful friends are never far from the action including the much changed Prince Jonathan, Myles (her adopted father), gruff Coram, her cat Faithful, and of course the lovable George. She is even joined on this adventure by some new faces - a Shang warrior and an outcast princess - who brought additional depth to Alanna's character. I was so pleased with Alanna's choices in this book - she truly proves herself to be a strong woman and a knight and I couldn't have enjoyed reading her story more.

I hated reading up to the sixth grade and that's when i started readin a little, but it wasn't until the seventh, when my friend brought the first book, Alanna, to school and let me borrow it, that i fell in love with reading. I had to finish the series, and then i had to read the other series by Tamora Pierce, which are also very awesome. They are all a mix of romance and adventure and they never get boring.

Way before Harry Potter came out. I loved every single book especially the last one because I loved George! Wouldn't recommend it to younger girls if they havent had the birds and the bees talk yet. (its in no way explicit, dont worry about that!) But I read it in 5th grade I think and its still my favorite book and series and it really shows that girls or young women can empower themselves and achieve whatever they set out to achieve.

Outbreak deals with the issue of deadly viruses and  was filled with action and intrigue.  The characters were well developed.  Well edited.  A real page turner.  

Robin Cook is one of the best medical thriller writers out there.  His books are timeless.  Read one of his books and you'll be hooked.  They always leave you thinking:  what if............."
"Outbreak (Dr. Marissa Blumenthal, #1)",042510687X,Robin Cook,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"I had to read this book for my 8th grade science project and LOVED it! It has plenty of excitement, and a great plot! The end of the story takes quite a twist.  You'll never guess..."

Searching for Dragons3. Calling on Dragons4. Talking with DragonsThe books are fantasy, with good adventure and plenty of humor. I read the series again about every two years. I know it's a good series for young people because I was student teaching in an 8th grade class when I discovered it. Some of the students recommended it. But so far all the adults I have recommended it to have also enjoyed the novels."
"Dealing with Dragons (Enchanted Forest Chronicles, #1)",015204566X,"Patricia C. Wrede, Peter de Sève",Barnes and Noble,4.7,Laurie_Jane_Kaye,"All 4 of these books are amazing! Don't be fooled by the cover and section you find them in, they're not just for kids. These books are jam packed with fantasy, humor, great characters, and non stop good plot lines. Good to read on your own or in the classroom."
"Running Blind (Jack Reacher, #4)",0515130974,Lee Child,Barnes and Noble,4,Niky333,"All the Reacher books are well worth reading. It's truly a travesty that a short, wimpy man like Tom Cruise has been cast to play a 6ft tall military man. This typecast of characters will totally ruin the imagination while reading the Reacher series, so I suggest you read them all now before Tom Cruise's bad acting ruins the books for you."
"Running Blind (Jack Reacher, #4)",0515130974,Lee Child,Barnes and Noble,4,Mason Moore,I am reading the Jack Reacher series in order and this is definately the best of the series so far. It caught me early and held my attention throughout.
"Running Blind (Jack Reacher, #4)",0515130974,Lee Child,Barnes and Noble,4,harstan,"He is a hero, trying to right the injustices in his part of the world.  Though at times he goes outside the law, he always makes life better for the person he is protecting.  At a new Italian restaurant in New York City, former MP Jack Reacher observes two thugs hitting on the owner for protection money.  When they return to collect their fee, Jack provides personal payment, sending both punks to the hospital.      FBI agents greet Jack with the knowledge that they believe he is a serial killer targeting female soldiers complaining about sexual harassment.  Apparently, Jack knew three victims, but he has the perfect alibi since FBI agents had Jack under surveillance at the time the fourth murder occurred.  The agents want Jack to help them uncover the identity of the killer because a department profiler insists that his personality is a match to that of the perpetrator.  Jack refuses until they threaten his girlfriend.  Jack begins his unique gathering of information that leads him to conclude that the FBI is traveling down the wrong paradigm, leaving former women in uniform in jeopardy unless he can persuade the department to change course.      RUNNING BLIND is an exciting thriller starring a sensitive, honorable person struggling with keeping one foot in the civilized world.    Anyone who has ¿profiled¿ F. Paul Wilson¿s ¿Repairman Jack¿ novels will realize the characters share many traits with the biggest difference being that Reacher is grounded in the physical realm while Repairman Jack deals with supernatural elements.  The crux of this mystery lies in the intensity of the killer whose extraordinary energy matches that of Jack, thus freshening up the serial killer tale.  With more novels like this one, Lee Child has the talent to become a superstar.    Harriet Klausner"
"Rules of Prey (Lucas Davenport, #1)",0425205819,John Sandford,Barnes and Noble,4,XMan,"Never kill anyone you know.
Never have a motive.
Never follow a discernable pattern.
Never carry a weapon after it has been used.


Listed above are a few of the many rules made by the serial madman that he has you obligated to follow. He is on the loose, in the meantime, while you're fighting to keep the press out of the loop. What would you do? Would you abide to his compulsive game? Would you stand idle and risk another innocent life being taken? Or would you, instead, come up with rules of your own in a way to cease the violence enforced by the bad guy. These are the questions that are pondering inside the mind of the hero in bestselling author John Sandford's RULES OF PREY.


The first installment of Sandford's well-known crime series introduces detective Lucas Davenport, a man with a life ahead of him. On duty, he is a tough, ruthless Minnesota cop who abides by little or no nonsense from anybody. Behind the badge, nevertheless, is a successful entrepreneur who writes games for a living. And from a personal standpoint, not to mention, he is a raunchy, womanizing swinger who constantly jumps in love from one woman to another.


In the debut of this hit series by Sandford, Davenport is called in to investigate a series of murders committed by Louis ""Maddogg"" Vullion. To every body who closely knows Louis, he is a mediocre tax attorney struggling to make ends meat. But the other face of Louis is that of an obsessive madman who commits his killings by religiously following a meticulous set of rules. In attempt of serving as a challenge to Davenport, he leaves a note of one of his rules at each and every one of his crime scenes, such as the ones mentioned earlier. With one killing happening after another, the media and the Twin Cities are in a paranoid frenzy. Lucas, on the other end, decides to play by rules of his own.


RULES OF PREY is a very entertaining entry by Sandford. His characters are likeable and fresh. The plot of the book is a cut-clean and simple one. Readers will find the story to be very satisfying, something they will not find to be either forced or tiring. A trait that readers will accolade him for is his ability to write. No doubt, SANDFORD IS WONDERFUL WITH THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE!!!! His ability to describe the settings and to be able to deride thoughts and ideas is just beyond out of this world. As far as complaints go, the only one that readers will conjure up is that of how the ending abruptly ended. It may not be of one that ties every event in place, yet it will be of one that readers that will find entertaining and satisfying."
"Rules of Prey (Lucas Davenport, #1)",0425205819,John Sandford,Barnes and Noble,4,tobcont,Interesting lead character and well rounded supporting characters. You¿ll even like the villain. From the first murder you¿re caught up in the story.  After reading the first in the prey series I couldn¿t stop until I read them all.  You won¿t be disappointed with Mr. Sanford¿s writing style.
"Rules of Prey (Lucas Davenport, #1)",0425205819,John Sandford,Barnes and Noble,4,Jessica_Rawlston,"This book was very well written the story and plot had an easy and realistic flow. The characters were very well thought out and developed. It is a murder mystery following along both the lead detective as well as the killer himself. You get an inside view of what the killer is thinking / feeling as well as the detective pursuing him. I thought it was nice to see both views! The characters were believable, likable, and in depth. Some sex in this book and adult content not appropriate for younger readers. At times fun and playful as well as gritty and ruthless at others. Turns twists and surprises! Story flows well and keeps you entertained. This would make a great book club book because it'd be fun to talk about with others. Makes you want to keep reading! Looking forward to reading the next books in the series!"

"Ashes to Ashes (Kovac and Liska, #1)",0553589172,Tami Hoag,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,I bought this book several years ago and read it from cover to cover. It wasn't until the last ten pages that I fully understood who the killer was. Most books I at least have an inkling as to who the killer is. Not this book. It had me guessing till the very end. The plot was intense and gripping with great character development without any of the cliches.
"Ashes to Ashes (Kovac and Liska, #1)",0553589172,Tami Hoag,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,This book rivals the best of Stephen King & Dean Koontz. It was an excellent book that was very suspenseful and sometimes chilling. It will make you look over your shoulder once or twice. It's also nice to have a good female mystery writer for a change.
The Yiddish Policemen's Union,0007149824,Michael Chabon,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Juliep,"I almost abandoned the book several times.  I did not understand the background until after reading the book at then reading someone's review.  I had to re-read several pages trying to make sense of them.  I turned the glossary a lot, which I thought was helpful, but there were still a lot of words that were not listed.  I don't plan on recommended it to friends."
The Yiddish Policemen's Union,0007149824,Michael Chabon,Barnes and Noble,3.7,liltie,"This book is a work of art. Chabon reinvents the detective story while keeping its conventions. Take ""The Big Sleep"" meets ""Blade Runner"", make every character Jewish and set it in near-present Alaska. 

The imagery and description is so compelling and complex, I found myself re-reading paragraphs just for the enjoyment of the words.

I got lost in this book, and that's the reason I read."
The Yiddish Policemen's Union,0007149824,Michael Chabon,Barnes and Noble,3.7,nbNYC,"I read all the reviews and sympathize with the person who said he/she may have been thrown off by all the ""Yiddish stuff."" I love all of Chabon's books--The Adventures of Cavalier and Clay is one of my all-time favorites--and I loved this book too but I can definitely see how someone not familiar with the Yiddish language and Jewish culture would get lost and lose patience. However, if you do know about Hasidic Jewish culture, the tension between secular and religious Jews, and if you know a bit of Yiddish, this book is hilarious and, of course, because it's Chabon, brilliantly written."
The Aviator's Wife,0345528670,Melanie Benjamin,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"I believe all women should read this book and young women need to know women heroes like Anne Morrow Lindbergh. Anne married a hero and that was a tough choice. The Lindbergh's were hounded by the press in a way that only Princess Di could have empathized with them. She virtually became a prisoner in her own home unable to go out to the theater or to shop. The only time they were free of scrutiny was when they were flying. In the earliest of airplanes, Anne became a pilot, a navigator and Charles' trusted one man crew. The soared before there were Tower controls, other planes, or radio communication. They planned airline routes and explored places that were hard to get to. They were a close couple and Charles called all the shots. Anne just obeyed.  It's the story of a woman trying to find her own voice and her own life. She wanted more than to be the &quot;Ambassador's Daughter&quot;, the &quot;Aviator's wife&quot; or the mother of her six children. She accomplished many things on this road and endured tragedy beyond comprehension. In the end, she took charge of her life and responsibility of her actions. She became a mature, grown-up woman.  The novel is entertaining enough if you can bear the pedestrian writing and the endless repetition. It seems to be well researched and doesn't gloss over Lindbergh's Nazi sympathies in the years leading up to WW 2. The description of the kidnapping and murder of the Lindbergh baby is heartbreaking."

A Bad Case of Stripes,0439598389,David Shannon,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,I tried to read this book with my daughter and didn't get a positive reaction. She is 6 and when we go to the bookstore she will cover this book with other books because she is afraid of it. To make matters worst now is in her class and she is very afraid of it that doesn't even want to go her class. I respect that might be a good story for some but others the illustrations are scary for some.
A Bad Case of Stripes,0439598389,David Shannon,Barnes and Noble,4.3,_Miss-Barb,A really fun book about peer pressure and simple remedies for most problems....my grandkids simply adore this book! My (now 20yrs old) oldest granddaughter even dressed up as Camilla one Halloween when she was about 8yrs old. It's fun to read and use all kinds of voices! Highly reccomend this book!
A Bad Case of Stripes,0439598389,David Shannon,Barnes and Noble,4.3,PortraitWords,I bought this book at a school book fair when I was 9 years old and I absolutely loved it. I read it several times and took it with me everywhere. It made me laugh and was definitely the most creative book I have ever read. The illustrations were beautiful and I'd stare at them for a long time before turning to the next page. I borrowed it from the library recently and still enjoy it as a 20 year old. I do know a girl who was terrified of the book though so I would be careful. But the other kids had no problem with it.
"The Affair (Jack Reacher, #16)",0593065700,Lee Child,Barnes and Noble,4,enticed,"As others have said, Lee Child is a superb craftsman of suspense. Can't wait to read more."
"The Affair (Jack Reacher, #16)",0593065700,Lee Child,Barnes and Noble,4,Molinarolo,"As a fan of the Jack Reacher Series, THE AFFAIR was ok; not good, but not bad. Lee Child takes the reader back to 1997 when our intrepid loner was still an Army MP on an undercover assignment to Carter Crossing, Mississippi. His assignment is to make nice with local law enforcement and relay what they know to his superiors. A young beautiful woman has been murdered. Her throat slit. Her bloodless body left in an alley. Her suspected killer, a solder stationed at the nearby base. A soldier who has powerful friends in Washington, D.C. Reacher has no trouble making nice to Elizabeth Devereaux. She is the county Sheriff and a former Marine MP and has linked Janice Mae Chapman's killing to two other dead beauties that the soldier dated. Ever loyal to the Army, Jack Reacher knows that this case will be his last. He will not participate in a cover up to protect one soldier.    
 
While the story is good, the telling gets tedious. Child repeats the 1997 references too often. Normally the reader gets up close to the serial killer and sees his or her psychology. 
We don't get that here with the exception of the destroyed car.  We do see, but not fully understand the puppet-master of the cover-up. The Washington ties to the soldier are strong, but would Pentagon Officers really go the extremes as Child wrote to protect one soldier? I think not. And some of Reacher's actions didn't ring true to his character, but the beginning and ending are very strong as well as the character development: finally a strong female that mirrors Jack. The midnight train and tracks become characters as well as strong suspense devices. But true Jack Reacher fans will ignore the flaws of the novel because of the good story THE AFFAIR is."
"The Affair (Jack Reacher, #16)",0593065700,Lee Child,Barnes and Noble,4,harstan,"In 1997 in Carter Crossing, Mississippi someone slashes the throat of twentyish Janice May Chapman by an isolated railroad track.  The Pentagon is concerned that evidence points to a Ranger training in nearby Fort Kelham committed the homicide as Captain Reed Riley has connections as his father Carleton is chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee.  

Colonel Garber assigns military police officer Major Jack Reacher to go undercover to learn the truth and keep the local sheriff Elizabeth Deveraux under control without her knowing it.  Each distrusts the other but soon need to protect each other's back from a dangerous cover-up as the military are uninterested in the facts; their preference is for a local hillbilly to take the rap.  However, Reacher becomes incompliant when he learns Janice is the third female to have been killed by this slasher.

The latest Reacher thriller (see Worth Dying For) is an exciting throwback tale to when the heroic vigilante was still in the Army.  Ironically though going back to the case that led to his leaving the military, there is not much new added to the Reacher mythos.  Still the story line is fast-paced and filled with action as Reacher learns what happens to officers doing their duty with personal courage vs. those with DC connections.

The Elements of Style is the easiest book to use in a writing class for both teachers and students alike. It is short and concise - so much so that students are not intimidated by what they are learning. Many of my students have actually enjoyed reading the book, as it is both informational and witty. I have heard many students say, ""I wish I had this book earlier in my writing career."" I second that!"
The Elements of Style,0205313426,"William Strunk Jr., E.B. White",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"The Elements of Style is one of the most important books that I own. Although I'm out of college, I refer to it again and again. Even if I'm not correcting grammar or punctuation, I'll still open the book to see what beautiful writing looks like. The writing is so darn clear that I often joke, 'If God wanted someone to teach Jesus how to write, God would have hired Strunk and White.'    The last chapter deals with writing and how to craft one's own voice. This is valuable for everyone, and although Elements isn't a 'how to' book on fiction writing, I've found S&W's advice to be sound while working on novels and short stories.     Keep this book in your coat pocket. Study it at red lights or on the subway. This book is timeless."
The Turn of the Screw,0140620613,Henry James,Barnes and Noble,2.7,dragonflyy419 on LibraryThing,"The Turn of the Screw by Henry James is a classic story of the paranormal. This novella is filled with suspense and vivid imagery and written in a way that draws you into the world woven around the manor at Bly.  The governess and the two children she looks after are central to this story.  James¿ writing style is an easy one to follow and he was adept at conveying the emotions of the governess.  Often, there is a sense of urgency about her.  The governess was the only well developed character in the book, but you feel a true connection to her and follow her emotions and suspicions intently.Stories that involve the paranormal and children always seem to be the most chilling to the blood.  James¿ used children to enhance the fearful and suspenseful aspects of this story.   I don¿t want to say much on the story as in doing so gives away much of the surprises that are within, so I will stop here.The emotions, imagery, and style were all easy to follow when reading this book.  The Turn of the Screw is a classic horror story that I would highly recommend reading."
The Turn of the Screw,0140620613,Henry James,Barnes and Noble,2.7,Ayling on LibraryThing,"I had to read this for English in year nine or ten I cannot rightly remember now. Anyway, I guess I'm not one much for ghost stories which is probably why I was never going to enjoy this book. Secondly we had to read it as a class, aloud one chapter at a time. I hate that. In a small group perhaps that would work but not a whole book. You do not really get to appreciate the language or the story because the change in reader (and quality of reader) was too distracting. I guess that's one way of making sure everyone does read it. Thirdly it was just a boring, pointless story. I can't remember precisely why now but I always liked reading in school, but this book was just absolutely excruciating. Perhaps I should give it a second read and see if my opinion has changed. Or maybe it will just reaffirm why I didn't like it.I remember wondering what the point was? Why is this story being told? Are the characters interesting? No. Is it well written? I can't remember so I cannot comment. Was what happened during the story interesting? No. Did I learn anything from it? No. Would I recommend it to anyone else? No."

Looking for a new horror story to keep you company as you sip your steaming mug of spiced cider by the light of a menacing-looking jack-o-lantern? Have I got the perfect story for you: Henry James¿s ¿Turn of the Screw.¿Coming in at just under 100 pages, ¿Turn of the Screw¿ is a quick read, although it¿s not the easiest. One thing is for sure, it¿s a ghost story. Err¿it might be a ghost story. Or, perhaps it chronicles the ravings of an off-her-rocker governess. But, still, it could be a ghost story ¿ actually, that¿s for you to decide.The story starts with friends telling each other scary stories one Christmas eve (yes, this story has dual holiday appeal). We are then thrust into the viewpoint of a young governess who accepts a job caring for a handsome bachelor¿s orphaned niece and nephew¿the nephew having just been expelled from his school for mysterious, unstated reasons.At the gothic estate, the governess encounters two ghost lovers on several occasions. Convinced that the children also sense and even interact with the ghosts, the governess begins to worry about their safety and puzzles over the ghosts¿ intentions. The children unwaveringly declare that they have not seen any ghosts at all, but the governess does not believe them. She clings to them tightly for their own good.Much, much more transpires, but it¿d be a shame to give away the shocking ending. This is a novella that you must read the full way through in order to fully appreciate.Read it with a friend or loved one. This story lends itself perfectly to discussion. Every reader will come up with a slightly different explanation as to who the ghosts are, what they want with the children, if the ghosts actually exist or are hallucinations of aforementioned governess, and even as to whether a dark sexual subtext explains it all.Try something different this Halloween season, you won¿t regret it!"
Best Friends Forever,0743294297,Jennifer Weiner,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Anonymous,"I enjoyed this book a lot. It was a quick read, enjoyable, and had a certain amount of mystery/suspense. I didn't love the somewhat abrupt ending. I wanted to know more about how things were sorted out with Jordan, Valerie, Addie, and the others. Not sure if the author is leaving the door open for a follow up book...!
Weiner's books are a little formulated, though. There's always a fat girl with 'mousy' hair who manages to slim down, there's always a fabulous friend, and there's a man who 'unexpectedly' becomes a love interest for the fat girl. I do enjoy seeing characters who aren't the typical chick lit read, but I'd like to see it mixed up a little."
Best Friends Forever,0743294297,Jennifer Weiner,Barnes and Noble,3.5,NYBeachgal,"I am a huge fan of Jennifer Weiner. With the exception of _The Guy Not Taken_, I've greatly enjoyed every one of her books (with _Good in Bed_ and _Certain Girls_ as personal all-time favorites), but this one just did not do it for me, at all ... sadly. 

There was a brief moment while the two main characters examined the issues in their ""breakup"" in which I teared up a bit at the thought of the ways my friendship with my first best friend went wrong, but the rest of the book seemed implausible (i.e. ""silly""), one-dimensional, and lacking in the depth I usually find beneath Weiner's humor. Though the main character is well defined, all other characters seem like total caricatures with a few who were downright stereotypes. 

This one is not worth reading, in my opinion."
Best Friends Forever,0743294297,Jennifer Weiner,Barnes and Noble,3.5,AuthorKellyMoran,"Author Jennifer Weiner is the New York Times best-selling author of several books including: Certain Girls, Good in Bed, Little Earthquakes, Goodnight Nobody, The Guy Not Taken, and In Her Shoes (which was made into a major motion picture.) She is a graduate of Princeton University and resides in Philadelphia, PA with her family.
When Valerie Adler moved across the street from Addie Downs when they were both nine years old, Addie just knew they'd be best friends forever. But in the wake of an incident and betrayal in high school, the friendship dissolves, leaving Addie as the scapegoat and Val swept into the popular crowd. Fifteen years later, Addie lives alone and Val has found a small measure of success as a weathergirl on the local T.V. station. Addie, caring for a troubled brother and trying the internet dating scene, opens her door to find her long lost best friend, Val, standing there with blood on her sleeve and a horrified expression. When it comes to friendship, some bonds can never be broken.
This is a work of literary fiction with romantic elements, and Jennifer Weiner fans won't be let down. This book is unique because it is not only told in first-person point-of-view by Addie, but also third-person by Jordan, and jumps from past to present smoothly, telling the back story in fragments. Targeted to be humorous and heart-breaking, it delivers a punch to your solar plexus that will remain with you long after the book is closed. Very few authors understand the human condition, our responses to stress, and the inner workings of our minds like Jennifer Weiner can. The over-eating, neglect, disappointment, and depression suffered by her characters will leave you in tears and wondering if they are real. The secondary characters were phenomenal adds to the storyline. You'll fall in love with Jordan and all his quirks. The romance elements were sweet and realistic. The plot flowed well and there were no dead spots. I would like to see this targeted not only for adults, but for the young adult market too, as they can learn a lot about the consequences of the choices they make and how much of an impact negativity can have on others.
Best Friends Forever, by Jennifer Weiner, is a riveting portrayal of friendship, love, family, loyalty, and betrayal. A guaranteed laugh and cry!

We,0140185852,"Yevgeny Zamyatin, Clarence Brown",Barnes and Noble,4.2,J_D_,"Like a refreshing breath of air, I chanced upon We as I was drowning in all the trashy sci-fi that has been filling shelves as of late. 
To say it simply, We is the best science fiction novel I have ever read (and I have read my fair share). It has, in its 203 pages, a story of a simple man who worships his government with a wild abandon, until the day when he contracts an awful and uniquely human condition. 

     We is a prime, perhaps the greatest, example of a Dystopian novel: it in many ways sets the groundwork for ALL dystopian stories to come. In it we read elements of famous books to come, such as Orwell's 1984 and Huxley's Brave New World. But. but there is something more, different, indescribable about We that Zamyatin could never have planned: a magic that resides in between the words.

     That being said, We is also one of the most exclusionary books I have read as well. While I fully believe that this book has never achieved the popularity and success that it should have, shared by 1984 and Brave New World, I can truly understand why: We is written as the journal of a mathematical genius, and his view of nature as ""some big equation, yet to be solved"" leaks heavily into his journal entries and this, coupled with his conflicting ideas about himself and his surroundings, does not make a welcoming environment for the everyday reader. 

     I highly recommend this book, but only to those hardcore sci-fi buffs and intellectual book-club readers that can wade through it. If it can be tolerated, or better yet appreciated for what it is, then We could be your next favorite-book."
We,0140185852,"Yevgeny Zamyatin, Clarence Brown",Barnes and Noble,4.2,JakeNJ,"Yevgeny Zamyatin has a very interesting history himself. Being a part of Russian Intelligentsia, he was a strong proponent of Russian revolutionary movement and a believer in &quot;change&quot; that was about to follow. While in England, he heard that the change is about to happen and Yevgeny rushed back, so that he could be part the movement to overthrow Czarist regime and create what he thought would have been a workers' paradise. Fast forward a bit and he started to realize that the change that he himself helped create was not at all what it was claiming to be and reality of that change created despot and despair. While the publishing and the media was not yet completely taken over by the new regime, he was able to publish and write several essays, but then further realizing that the regime is changing even more so, he was banned and even arrested for his ideological free voice.




If you liked &quot;Brave New World&quot; and &quot;1984&quot;, you will love this or actually the other way around. &quot;We&quot; was published before the other two and there are so many items here that were borrowed by Huxley and Orwell, it is not even a question of if, but obvious what and which portions were. Zamyatin creates a One State society in his novel &quot;We&quot;, where everyone and everything is for Benefactor's sake and for the &quot;happiness&quot; of the citizens. The wall around the city doesn't just protect those from outside getting in, but also for those inside for being &quot;happy&quot;. Here we see strong resemblances of the same picture perfect anti Utopian &quot;Utopia&quot; as in &quot;Brave New World&quot;. We see rationing and partnership assignments, if you will, just like in Huxley's novel, and many parts, which I am sure Huxley decided to &quot;borrow&quot; from &quot;We&quot;. Also, there are many examples of despot and punishment, social behavior and work related previsions as we see in &quot;1984&quot; later. My guess is as such. Since Soviet Union was not big on world copyright laws, and the fact that some of Zamyatin's works were not officially published until 1980s and even 90s, that both Huxley and Orwell had an opportunity to reviewing those works. Lesser in popularity of all three of those anti Utopian novels, &quot;We&quot; however does present a great example, interesting and clever plot on the society that is &quot;great&quot; in theory, but not so in reality. 




Zamyatin is a great visionary and this book, scary enough, could have been a road map for despots to use. &quot;Freedom or happiness, but if you are free, you can't be happy&quot; - We, Zamyatin. Also, the numerous examples of how &quot;chaotic&quot; the free world is and was, in what &quot;We&quot; refers to as in ancients' way of life. Freedom caused crime and war according to One State and Benefactor. It seems that by associating freedom with all the &quot;evil&quot; in the world, the Benefactor and Guardians are able to create this &quot;perfect&quot; happy world that is not free, but &quot;happy&quot;. 




Overall, I really enjoyed reading this first of the three great anti Utopian novels. It is a wonderful example of both fiction and the author's reality, how utopia only exists in theory, but in reality people do want and do strive for freedom to make their own decision and their own choices. Zamyatin's life, is a perfect example of to be careful of what you wish for and out of the three, he is the only author who actually wrote his work while living in completely despotic society. Highly recommend it to everyone who enjoys this genre."
We,0140185852,"Yevgeny Zamyatin, Clarence Brown",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"I really won't get into it here. ""We"" is a book that you have to read to understand why I feel this way. If you remember reading dystopian novels in high school, I can guarantee that your teacher missed this jewel. A precursor and inspiration to 1984 and Brave New World, this book makes Ayn Rand's Anthem look like a kids book. (not to mention that I believe that her book is a blatant rip of the subject book.) Zamyatin's genius truly shines in this short but well thought out piece of anti-Stalinist writing, that transcends (as all good books do) time and space."
Pigs in Heaven,0571171788,Barbara Kingsolver,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Adrian Sloan,Loved this book as much as I did Bean Trees!
Pigs in Heaven,0571171788,Barbara Kingsolver,Barnes and Noble,4.2,EmiliaBartelheim,"Pigs in Heaven is a book I was really not looking forward to read at all. I chose it for the theme, and going into this I was dreading reading it, as there's nothing worse than having to read a really bad book, but I came out of it with a book that I can definitely call one of my favourites now. 
The real story begins with Taylor Greer on a sort of soul searching trip with her adoptive daughter, Turtle, a six year old girl Taylor was just handed three years earlier. They visit the Hoover Dam, and Turtle witnesses a near death, which lands them in the public eye for saving a man's life. It brings attention to Turtle's heritage, a void adoption, and a sudden battle to sort a girl into one of two cultures under what each think her best interests would be. Along the way, they meet strange characters, both for their gain and detriment, and the story not only follows them but a variety of characters all centered around the same plot. The relationships of every individual character that Kingsolver rotates through each chapter, and the development of their lives in relation to each other, highlights the actuality of personality in comparison to one's perception of themselves and the continuous segregation of culture and races in modern times. 
I can't really think of anything I didn't like about the book. The voice was really well executed, and the story line unlike anything I've read before. Somewhat educational, and research was obviously done to write the novel. One should read this book not for any particular reason than to read. It could aid in perhaps gaining a better understanding of modern segregation, but it's no history lesson.
And although I tend to gravitate towards the 'New Science Fiction' section of the bookstores I frequent, there is a timeless quality that some books seem to have, this included, where you're not focusing on how it shallowly relates to your own life. You just read it."
Pigs in Heaven,0571171788,Barbara Kingsolver,Barnes and Noble,4.2,sawyierlady,"Kingsolver weaves the characters into a story that is unforgetable, building on culture of the localities involved.  Great reading for pleasure and learning about differences."
"The Ghost Brigades (Old Man's War, #2)",0765354063,John Scalzi,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Iowa_SF_Lover,"Excellent sequel to Old Man's War.  Actually superior.  Besides excellent action raises interesting questions about individuality, government control of the individual and duty beyond self."
"The Ghost Brigades (Old Man's War, #2)",0765354063,John Scalzi,Barnes and Noble,4.3,AZ_James,"John Scalzi's super-futuristic novels are a SciFi fan's dream come true. They have great characters, interesting alien species and are full of insane technology and crazier action. If you like Star Wars, Star Trek, or Douglas Adams you will like John Scalzi's work."
"The Ghost Brigades (Old Man's War, #2)",0765354063,John Scalzi,Barnes and Noble,4.3,nealcWA,"I enjoyed the first book, Old Man's War, but this is much better.  More interesting riffs on the plot ideas."
"Cry, the Beloved Country",074326195X,Alan Paton,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Chas_Ackerman,"This strange, lyrical novel is easily the most agonizing painful books I've ever read. Murder is perhaps the most overdone topic in the history of literature, but if all were done like this, we couldn't bear to read many. Published months before white supremacists created the legal system of apartheid (and set two years earlier, in the fall of 1946), the novel follows the fathers of an accidental killer and his unintended victim, starting before the murder and ending only after we get a sense of its ripple effects through the lives of whites and blacks as they try to make sense of the utterly pointless tragedy and the social system that led to it. It's a novel that does little to try to flashily seduce the reader. It starts out with a description of a rural valley in South Africa, a description that is repeated later with some key differences. Then it moves dialogue that almost sounds off-key: there are no quotation marks, only dashes, to indicate speakers and the characters have an odd repetitious quality to their speech that puzzles at first. At the risk of only a little hyperbole, it sounds like this: -- The sky is blue. -- You say the sky is blue. His eyes flickered upward. -- I say the sky is blue. -- I understand. The man nodded. -- You understand. My initial reaction to this was, ""Oh man, did I pay for this?"" But then as the matters grow more serious, I learned to appreciate that such dialogue has a somber rhythm, if not beauty, to it. It is not so much repetition as characters recognizing each other's humanity. And that is what makes this book so painful. Paton at every key moment goes for the perfectly understated emotion. The father of the murder victim does nothing histrionic -- there's simply this powerful scene in which he looks around his son's library, which is filled with passionate political books that mean nothing to him. He's forced to simultaneously confront the gulf that had arisen between himself and his son -- this sense that his own offspring is a mystery -- and also the grievous sense of loss in the quiet room (with the blood stain down the hallway). Scenes like this hurt. Toward the end, there's a stretch of maybe thirty or forty pages in which the characters briefly become symbols and Paton seems to be letting whites off easy in their greater complicity. But Paton himself seems aware of this, as he has a character that I was starting to find unrealistic deny that he is a saint and another character points out how much of the blame rests with the sins against humanity of the whites. What to make of these possible missteps by Paton and his own attempt to ameliorate them become a moot point by the powerful final scene. It's simply a man watching the sunrise. Yet, because of what it means when the sun rises above the horizon, I think that scene will stay with me far longer than the last couple pages of any other novel I've ever read. I am, I'm sure, reading this at a time when I'm particularly susceptible to its sentiments. After months of worrying about whether my infant son, who has just seemed like a bundle of vulnerability, I am watching him grow past the initial troubles that can beset a baby. He is starting to show a personality and I can begin to wonder what the future will hold in store for him. And this novel combines what are probably the two worst fates your child could experience: to murder or to be murdered. To me this is much more of a horror novel than some junk abou"
"Cry, the Beloved Country",074326195X,Alan Paton,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"This book is great, and if you rated the book one star on the complaint that the first chapter is about grass, you are idiotic. The meaning of the first chapter is much greater than just grass, and if you were reading the book and it was at your reading level, you would understand! Everyone should read this book!"
"Cry, the Beloved Country",074326195X,Alan Paton,Barnes and Noble,4.1,The_hibernators,"I had a hard time deciding between three and four stars for this book. It is a classic and deals with a very difficult subject, but the story-line seems scattered at times. Paton was trying to communicate the pain, fear, and anger that punctuated life in South Africa in the 1940s. This sociological topic is difficult for young people to grasp.well, it's difficult for not-so-young people to grasp if they have never experienced it. Thus, I found the book's topic interesting and learned a lot. The main character was complex and well-rounded. The raw emotion was captured. Because of this, I give the book four stars. However, a word of caution: when you read it, be prepared to accept the slow-moving, disconnected story line and just enjoy the characters and the sociological portrayal."
Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister,0060987529,Gregory Maguire,Barnes and Noble,4,TICNC,"I struggled with this book in the first couple of chapters and wanted to stop reading it but knew I had paid the money for it.  I am SO glad I kept reading.  Maguire created a very unique way of retelling an old story with a modern day twist.  If you liked ""Wicked"" I think you will like this one as well."
Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister,0060987529,Gregory Maguire,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"i really enjoyed this book. i did see that other reviewers thought it dragged on, but i disagree. it was difficult to put down for me. i read it a steady pace and finished it in about a weekend. this book was almost enchanting. when i put it down to go to bed... i still thought of it while lying down. its almost like it haunted my thoughts!     this book was beautifully written. it allows you to get to know the characters and decide on your own who you like and dislike. the end almost had sort of a twist which was pleasing to me. i did not feel as though there were any unanswered or untouched topics. i highly reccommend this book to anyone who liked wicked. i actually think i enjoyed it a little more than wicked!"
Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister,0060987529,Gregory Maguire,Barnes and Noble,4,TalieTurner,"This is one of my favorite books of all time!  Maguire's boldness in ""re-telling"" fairy tales is, simply put, exquisite.  Raising two daughters, I have to admit that I get tired of sugar-coated Disney tales, so knowing that I can turn to a darker, grown-up fairy tale world when my gals are in bed makes endless viewings of Cinderella palatable.  Let go your old ideas and allow Maguire's words sweep you into a place where princes are not always charming, stepmothers have more driving them than jealousy and beauty is a curse."
"Lady Midnight (The Dark Artifices, #1)",1442468351,Cassandra Clare,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Anonymous,"More representation; a confirmed bisexual character, a nicely written autistic character, and more people of color. 
Interesting concepts; ableism in Shadowhunter society, falling in love with your Parabatai, and the things people are willing to do for love. 
Lovely characters; many of them are easily liked and relatable. 
But, it's a tad drawn out and the writing is sort of confusing at times. I feel like the Mortal Instruments characters got a bit too much attention. I also am disappointed she didn't include any dialogue from Helen and Aline. 
I'll admit the forbidden love trope is a little tiring, but this isn't too badly written."

Foundation's Edge (Foundation #4),0553293389,Isaac Asimov,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"Isaac Asimov, who had made an intermission of more than 3 decades to write the fourth title of the Foundation series, did not expect ""Foundation's Edge"" to become his first bestseller and above all, to win the Hugo award. I've read this book in English and in Spanish and I could not find a single imperfection; it is just a one of the most wonderful science fiction books written by Isaac Asimov.   This story, which protagonists are Golan Trevize and Janov Pelorat, begins in the middle-age Terminus. There, Trevize is sent to the outer space to find the Second Foundation, for his friend Munn Li Compor had betrayed him by reporting the authorities that Trevize supported the belief that the 2nd Foundation still existed.  In the spaceship, he meets his companion, the historian Janov Pelorat, an old man looking for traces of the legendary Imperial Library. The Second Foundation, dealing with squarrels among themselves, decide to send Stor Gendibal to prove his strength and return as a glorious First Orator. Intrigues about the identity and location of the Earth and the mysterious Gaia foreshadow the great decision Trevize has to make for the fate of the Galaxy: Terminus (1st Foundation), Trantor (2nd Foundation), or the living-conscience planet Gaia?"
Foundation's Edge (Foundation #4),0553293389,Isaac Asimov,Barnes and Noble,4.2,JBreedlove on LibraryThing,The best of the Foundation series that I've read. Except for a bit of multi-universe background ranting toward the end a smooth and easy read. Looking forward to the next in the series.
Foundation's Edge (Foundation #4),0553293389,Isaac Asimov,Barnes and Noble,4.2,TadAD on LibraryThing,"Thirty years after he wrote the original trilogy, Asimov decided to add to it giving the quite refreshing reason of, ""the size of the payment offered by the publisher."" :-)This volume and Foundation and Earth not only extended the original books, they tied in his Robots series and his other novels set in the Galactic Empire.  I don't think they worked as well as the original books and, like many Grand Unification plans of authors, I wish he had just left the stories separate."
Jude the Obscure,0486452433,Thomas Hardy,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Mariamosis,"Between 'Far From the Madding Crowd', 'The Mayor of Casterbridge', and 'Jude the Obscure' I am becoming a true Thomas Hardy fan!(more emphasis put on the latter two)

Jude Fawley and Sue Bridehead really bring the book to life, but lurking in the background are numerous others waiting to uproot the lovers happiness. With the curious nature of Father Time and his sinister mother, Arabella, deceit is always around the corner. However, Richard Phillotson, takes a different approach to contol Sue by using his good nature and an unexpected tragedy against her.

There are too many plot twists to go into too much detail, however, this book is definitely worth reading."
Jude the Obscure,0486452433,Thomas Hardy,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Anonymous,"This is a very good book. Unfortunately, when Google scanned this one, their OCR software did a terrible job of translation. You're better off getting another copy elsewhere -- perhaps Project Guetenburg."
Jude the Obscure,0486452433,Thomas Hardy,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Guest,"I can`t honestly say what attrached me to this book, nor why I continued to read it to the very end. The relationship between Jude and Sue is absolutely frustrating, mostly due to Sue`s capricious nature. There are times in the book during which I had the strong urge to strike her. I suppose Sue and her ideals were revolutionary in a way, but not as much as I was led to believe. Her descent in the end completely negates her earlier virtues, and I feel it was almost out of place. The character stopped being Sue. As a comment to the children being trivialized, I agree entirely. All the children, aside from Father Time, aren`t even named, so while the turning point in the characters` lives is affective, the children`s anonimity detracts from the reader`s sympathy. All in all, even though I wasn`t completely thrilled with this novel, it has some redeeming values, and I would recommend it if you had nothing better to read."
"Queen of Sorcery (The Belgariad, #2)",0345335651,David Eddings,Barnes and Noble,4.5,TheLostEntwife on LibraryThing,"I'm always a little apprehensive when approaching the middle book of a trilogy.  The questions in my mind are usually: How will people I've come to love in the first book be treated?  Will the main character (especially since he's a child in this case) grow annoying and hard to relate to?  Who else will be introduced?  How will the story move toward a conclusion in the third book?David Eddings did a fantastic job with putting me at ease regarding each and every one of those questions.  New villains were introduced, and they are colorful and amazing.  Old enemies were put to rest, moving the story forward in a way that was unexpected and fantastic.  And new friends were brought into the mix - in this case a young, 15 year old girl who had me roaring with laughter.Although Garion whined and wallowed a bit, it was comforting to see David Eddings address that head on, and in the process provide his readers with hope that it will change.  If anything - it reminded me that Garion is still just a boy (as evidenced by a rather hilarious scene regarding learning to shave).  Great story movement, fantastic characters, a huge amount of fantastic world building - this series is living up to every good thing I've been told about it."
"Queen of Sorcery (The Belgariad, #2)",0345335651,David Eddings,Barnes and Noble,4.5,exlibrisbitsy on LibraryThing,"Queen of Sorcery picks up where Pawn of Prophecy left off with the ever-growing group headed by Belgarath, along with his daughter Polgara and her charge Garion, chasing the stolen Orb of Aldur. The adventure continues, and small skirmishes and battles ensue as the group travels on theie quest. Intrigue is uncovered in far off cities. Whole new cultures are shown, very different from the ones we knew before. Plus new characters are introduced that promise to delight and vex us all.The second book in the Belgariad promises to be very different from the one before because Garion is no longer just a young child as he was in the first book. Time has passed and little Garion is growing up. There are a lot more teen angst style growing pains in this book than the last as a result. Especially as he struggles with his Aunt¿s true identity, and his own.Several new cultures are introduced as well and all of them provide their own complex controversies. The Dryads who look like children but are extremely sexually active. The starving and suffering of the serfs in Mimbre is juxtaposed with the ¿honorable¿ knights that rule them. And finally Nyissa ¿ a country that highly values snakes and the concept of immortality, when they aren¿t taking drugs or poisoning one another ¿ features another highly sexualized being in the form of their ¿queen¿ who has ruled Nyissa for generations, or has she?In amongst all of this though there are some gems for feminists to appreciate, just a few though. The largest being Polgara herself. She sews for the enjoyment of it, loves to wear pretty dresses, and be told she is beautiful, but she is also a very powerful and very wise sorceress and when she says jump the kings of the world do so immediately. I like that this shows that you can embrace femininity and still be considered worthy of power and respect. Something not often shown in any fiction let alone an 80¿s high fantasy novel.While the beginning of this novel seems to show a repeat of some of the same events of the last one (a plot is uncovered, Garion is in the middle of things again, new characters join the quest) there are a lot of new twists and turns as well. This is an enjoyable read that builds on the world of Pawn of Prophecy and promises more to come in the next book as the quest continues to reclaim the Orb of Aldur."
"Queen of Sorcery (The Belgariad, #2)",0345335651,David Eddings,Barnes and Noble,4.5,mpritchett on LibraryThing,"This book built on the foundations started by the first.  In fact, I found it a better read than the long character introduction of the first novel in the series.   Nothing really ground breaking happens, except the main character Garion learns more about himself and his abilities.  Of course, not all is told, but enough hints litter the story telling to set up the next three novels in the series."

"Wings (Wings, #1)",0061668036,Aprilynne Pike,Barnes and Noble,4.3,WinterReign,"Aprilynne Pike has made an outstanding debut with her  Novel, 'Wings'. It's a story about fairies, but not in the typical sense that, if a person hated fairies and fairy folk,they would definetly love this story. A complete reinvention of what the world has known about fairies and the like and made it an exciting, modern, and magical tale. Making her own world of fairies seem so entirely real and believable that you can't help but wonder that maybe your theories about your best friend- you know the insanley goregous, talented, graceful,and sweet friend of yours-being a fairy might actually be true. 
 I found myself liking Laurel as a best friend, falling for sweet and caring David, and wanting more of charasmatic and mysterious Tamani.I could not get enough of the mythology of fairies and fairy-folk she created in her world and I am left with wanting more!
 Her writing style is wonderfully vivid and real that it transports your right from your couch, into the pages  and onto the cool, beautiful breezy California coast. Her voice is charming, soft,and it pulls you in deeper into the crisp pages of the story, making it difficult NOT to keep turning the pages until your eyes are bleary and unfocused with sleep. With a bit of humor, wit, and sass thrown - oh!so cleverly- in at the right moments it's a story not to miss!
 I truly loved reading this book. Getting into the mythology of what Aprilynne created for her fairies and seeing such defined, likeable, and well rounded characters, and a unique story kept me turning the pages well into the early morining hours. I cannot wait to read the next installments of this lovely story and see what the future hold for her. She defenitley has a long career ahead of her. Yay for us Idaho girls!!"
"Wings (Wings, #1)",0061668036,Aprilynne Pike,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"Aprillynne Pike is a fun new voice in the realm of modern day faery tales. Maybe that's the ultimate thing to remember - the ""fun"" part. If you're looking for a quick read fluent in escapism, WINGS is a good way to spend a rainy Saturday. I think it will serve particularly well as a clean summer read for middle school girls who want to slip away into a faery fantasy. However, I can't imagine this book will hook older readers. In fact, I'm a bit surprised it was already on a bestseller list. Despite an engaging concept, WINGS never took off. The writing style is a bit grating after awhile: slow start, lots of backstory dumped in awkward places, back to back chapters full of nothing but dialogue, and zero chemistry (so far) between the love interests. The book was free of purple prose, which is nice, but it was also free of most any prose at all which made for a tedious read. I also found the main character, Laurel, a bit too self-posessed. She frequently talks about how beautiful she is (blonde and fair, of course), how beautiful the faery Tamani is, how beautiful, beautiful, beautiful the world is. Even if Stephenie Meyer hadn't offered an endorsement for this book, I would have assumed Pike was a Meyer fan. Unlike Meyer's books, I didn't feel any attachment to Pike's world, or her characters, after the story ended. I see some definite potential though and I'm excited to see how Aprilynne Pike grows as a writer. If you're a younger reader, I would definitely suggest you give WINGS a try. Faery Rebels (or Knife in the UK) by RJ Anderson might be a better alternative. (Also, I've seen discussion about how Pike's WINGS compares to ED Baker's WINGS. I've read both and I don't think they don't have a whole lot in common other than title, similar character names, and the fact that both girls have some form of ""wings"". If you like one book though, you might enjoy the other.)"
"Wings (Wings, #1)",0061668036,Aprilynne Pike,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Dana_W,This book is great!  I started reading it today and can't put it down.  The story sucks you in and doesn't let go! It is beautiful!  A must read for anyone who loves fairytales.  Twilight fans will love it too!
"Gossip Girl (Gossip Girl, #1)",0316910333,Cecily von Ziegesar,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"I had listened to my friends talk about the Gossip Girl series for awhile. They said they were great books and really interesting for teenagers to read. I have never really been much into reading but finally a book seemed appealing to me. Then, the television series came out and I was talking to my friends about it before I saw it. They said I had to read the books first, that the show just wasn¿t the same. I took their advice and picked up the first four books and haven¿t been able to stop reading them since. Although, I don¿t have a whole lot of time for reading, but I really enjoy Gossip Girl when I have the time.   	The book is very relatable to teenagers. Although, it is far from my lifestyle, it still focuses on situations that teenagers get into and how they deal with them. I would especially recommend this book to all of my teenager friends. Sometimes when I am reading it, I get so caught up in it that I really feel that I am with these characters and living their lifestyle. The way it is written is very realistic and entertaining. I really like that the books are easy to read and a fast page-turner. They keep you interested and wanting to know what is going to happen next.   	I have fallen in love with almost all of the characters. Some I wish were my best friends, some I wish I could party with, and some I wish I knew just to know. They all seem to live such fabulous, luxurious lifestyles, but then you keep reading and realize that they are normal people too. They get into some of the same situations and have the same problems as normal teenagers have. This is what I love most. It is an entertaining book that I can also relate to. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone and have started reading the second book, You Know You Love Me. I love it already and can¿t wait to read more!!"

The Odessa File,0553271989,Frederick Forsyth,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,This book is an excellent source for execitement for anyone who enjoys this type of entertainment.  The way that Forsythe mixes fact with fiction to tell the history of post-war Germany is intriguing.  I have read this book several times and it only gets better each time.
The Odessa File,0553271989,Frederick Forsyth,Barnes and Noble,4.2,jontseng on LibraryThing,"Diligently research and gripping. A classic example of a ""page-turning"" thriller."
The Odessa File,0553271989,Frederick Forsyth,Barnes and Noble,4.2,soylentgreen23 on LibraryThing,"Forsyth was a celebrity contestant on ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"" and could have won half a million had he had the courage to risk a charity's money. He is a terribly smart man, with a formidable general knowledge, and comes across as so modest and charming; why, then, is his work so kitsch, so constipated, so horrible? The Odessa File is one of his better pieces - woebetide the man who reads ""The Phantom of Manhattan"". It is a revenge story. It takes place in the decades after the second world war, when memories still linger of the Nazis' war crimes. So too do some of the remaining Nazis linger; they haven't all run off to Argentina or Brazil just yet. On to the case comes Forsyth's brilliant foreign correspondent in Germany, following a tip from a dying Jew as to the identity and location of one of the remaining war criminals. The story is like an extended chase without the chasing, leading to an inevitable confrontation and an inevitable twist.The story is impressive really, with incidental details that add a thickness to the plot that it would otherwise lack. But Forsyth cannot write. He spends an age detailing an intricate incursion into the world of the neo-Nazis, and within minutes of the incursion the whole plan breaks down - all the work is for nothing. And all the references to the powerful car our hero drives - it's as if the poor man has nothing in his trousers worth mentioning.I've read far worse, but there is a general rule in fiction - when the author's name appears in larger text than the title on the front cover, begin to worry."
The Burgess Boys,1400067685,Elizabeth Strout,Barnes and Noble,3.4,Anonymous,"I don't usually leave recommendations, but I decided this book needed to be talked about.  I read Olive Ketteridge previously and knew this would also be a wonderful book.  I love a good story with strong characters and this has both.  There are no wild twists or torns, no sex, and no intrigue - just good story telling with a message.  If you hunger for a good story, this is it."
The Burgess Boys,1400067685,Elizabeth Strout,Barnes and Noble,3.4,Anonymous,"As soon as I saw that Elizabeth Stroud had a new book coming out I pre-ordered The Burgess Boys!  I was hooked on the author after reading Olive Kitteridge which I loved.  This book is ultimately a story of a family's entertwined lives and how each member fits into the family dynamic while dealing with a crisis.  I enjoy reading Ms. Stroud's style of writing, it keeps me turning the pages.  Some may find the interaction between the family members uncomfortable to read at times but it is true to the story."
The Burgess Boys,1400067685,Elizabeth Strout,Barnes and Noble,3.4,Anonymous,"This is a dreary read. ...a dysfunctional family story-and mostly unlikable characters.

The Complete Works,0517053616,William Shakespeare,Barnes and Noble,3.1,Anonymous,"Caution, if you own a nook or are thinking of downloading this ""file"" of Shakespeare's complete works, you're ultimately going to be so disappointed. I am a proud nook owner, I purchased my treasured e-reader early in February and one of the first e-books I wanted to download was The Complete Works of William Shakespeare. Oddly this particular copy and another wouldn't download (it would go from 56% downloaded then drop to 16% in seconds), then when I did finally download them, they were incomplete, and to add insult to injury the copies ""froze"" my nook when opening or trying to view them. This was the one and only time my nook froze when opening any e-book. Anyway, when I did actually get to review my download, only half of one play ""Richard III"" was available, and in both copies the contents were in very grainy detail. So I tried to download again-same outcome. I understand that downloading a free book comes with some disappointment and, the old saying applies here ""you get what you pay for"" but the contents clearly state every one of Shakespeare wonderful plays and poems but that's not what you are getting when you view it on your nook.
I apologize for giving anything involved with the bard anything lower in rating, then what the brilliant works deserves, but this format and this copy of The Complete Works of William Shakespeare needs to be addressed. Please Barnes & Noble convert and have available a ""complete"" comprehensive e-book worthy of Shakespeare."
The Complete Works,0517053616,William Shakespeare,Barnes and Noble,3.1,Anonymous,"I was very disappointed after downloading this to discover that in spite of the fact that the title very clearly states ""Shakespeare's Complete Works,"" the only plays the document contained for me were Richard the III and Henry the IV.

The Dispossessed,0061054887,Ursula K. Le Guin,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"I was lucky to start reading Ursula K. L'Guin with this book. Then I read all the others, but this one has always remained special. I read probably 30 SF books and I think this one was the easiest to read, most understandable, most humanist and the one that thaught and reminded me of what it means to be a scientist and to be socially responsible."
The Dispossessed,0061054887,Ursula K. Le Guin,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"This book shows us more about our world, and the walls we build up that limit and narrow our lives, than any philosophy I have read, without the exception of F. Nietzche.  Our assumptions about human nature are deeply questioned, and an incredibly humanitarian option is presented to us (one which has been swallowed by the defeat of 'communism').  To her credit, Le Guin does not present either side in this 'debate' in a narrow way, and questions all sides deeply.  She gives a view of a utopia that is the most plausible and likely of any I have encountered (largely due to its imperfection).  It is a utopia where what we gain is much more important than what we lose, yet the gains are imperiled as the tendency to institutionalize manifests itself within the society.  The Marxist idea of a need for constant revolution is made real, so that, after reading this book, we will perhaps be able to make real in our world (and in ourselves) the state of constant revolt, which is the only answer to the problems of entropy, ennui and bureaucracy which plague our modern civilization.  Lets not wind up the way we do in The Dispossessed."

"Faceless Killers (Kurt Wallander, #1)",1400031575,"Henning Mankell, Steven T. Murray",Barnes and Noble,3.5,Sensitivemuse,"This book is definitely different from the police novels I've read in the past. The majority of the ones I've read had been rather fast paced filled with lots of intrigue and twists that I'm racing through the novel at an alarming rate. This one was very different. It wasn't fast paced but it was steady and although a little slow at times, it actually got me interested as the criminal investigation went on. It was a gradual procedure, and not one that would take overnight to solve. It had its exciting moments, but moments where you had to sit down and reflect as to what was going on, and it was a much different kind of police procedural novel I have ever seen so far. It was a good balance of careful analysis and examination mixed with intrigue and action. The plot did a good job of drawing you into the crime and having you also reflect and examine on how to solve it. I felt just as frustrated like Kurt was feeling when it felt as if he kept on reaching dead ends and cold trails that would lead nowhere in solving the crime.

The thing I liked the most was the character in Kurt Wallander. He's very real and three dimensional. He had his own issues to solve and it involved a total different story arc on its own aside from the murder case so you're not entirely focused on the mystery. You also got to see the ""human"" side of Kurt as well which I enjoyed and very much liked. It gave the story a much more realistic feeling to it and not something sensation or ""Hollywood"" about the entire plot. Kurt had his own faults too and so did his colleagues. I also liked how the story also focused on the secondary characters as well (especially his partner Rydberg, who also has major problems of his own). It was great to see realistic almost ""fleshy"" characters in the book.

I guess what I didn't really like was I'm not used to this style of writing, so I was really expecting this big flash bang sensational ending where I would be left speechless. This book isn't meant to be that way. The case was closed, and solved and that was that. No big gunfight. No SWAT team. No hostages. No Channel 6 news helicopters flying overhead (har har). It was simple, clean cut, and done. Then again the entire book was like that; clean and to the point. It was like one giant puzzle being put together and having the satisfaction of having it completed on time. Nothing celebratory or excitement just job done, go home and relax. I suppose that's how it's really done and if so, then it's another good job at keeping the story realistic.

Would I read the books following this? sure, why not? it's a short read and I don't regret picking this book up. Although it's not exciting as I hoped it would be, it held my attention enough to keep me going, as I was curious as to who did it and why. Secrets were exposed, and closure was met, and all loose ends were tied. It was well done and complete. 

Overall, don't be looking for grand excitement in this one. Just a good realistic police detective novel. It's realistic, and interesting as it takes you along a journey through Sweden and their way of life. It's definitely worth giving it a try if you're up for something mellow and a more on the serious side of the police force."
"Faceless Killers (Kurt Wallander, #1)",1400031575,"Henning Mankell, Steven T. Murray",Barnes and Noble,3.5,Guest,"If you're tired of all the focus on forensic evidence and are interested in some old-fashioned detective work, this will be the book for you.  The murder is gruesome and the detective, Kurt Wallender, wants badly to solve it.  But, the thing that makes this book so good is the author's ability to take you inside Wallender's life.  He has many of the issues of middle-aged people - financial problems, divorce, concerns for his child and his father.  These all compete for his time and the author does a fabulous job of pacing the book so you really get the idea of what it takes to solve a major crime while living a normal, albeit stressful, life."
"Faceless Killers (Kurt Wallander, #1)",1400031575,"Henning Mankell, Steven T. Murray",Barnes and Noble,3.5,Anonymous,"I gave this one 5 stars, although at the time I read it I may have given it 4.  The entire series is wonderful and deserves a 5.  Yes, this is a police crime mystery and the plot is a good one, but the main reason I enjoy these books is the character, Wallander.  He is so interesting, 3 dimensional, flawed, funny, accessible, etc.  You really end up caring about him, wanting to know more and hoping the book won't end.  I love the setting, which I was not familiar with.  Enjoy!"
The Confession,0385528043,John Grisham,Barnes and Noble,3.8,biff,"I have read all of Grisham's previous books. I love the Firm & Pelican Brief. The Confession is not one of my favorites books. The build up to the coda was just ok, but the preachie, liberal ending is too much, even for a avid reader of all genre. Leave the preaching to my rector & stay with writing like you did in the begining. So many of my favorite authors have stooped to tearful whining, that I may have to find someone new to read. I will give Mr. Grisham one more chance, then I'm done."
The Confession,0385528043,John Grisham,Barnes and Noble,3.8,lawabidingTexan,"An obvious rant against the death penalty and the criminal justice system in Texas, disguised as a fiction thriller.  It is a Grisham quality story but there is too much preachiness.  This was covered in his nonfiction book."
The Confession,0385528043,John Grisham,Barnes and Noble,3.8,OCGIRL,"I anxiously waited John Grisham's latest release.  I just finished it and was very disappointed.  The writing was okay, the characters, predictible and the underlying political anti-detah penalty message, sappy and overdone.  Mr. Grisham has now been added to the same list that James Patterson is on - an author who used to be compelling but who now is adequate, at best.  I'll wait for the paperback the next time."
Lightning,0425192032,Dean Koontz,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Country_Boy9,"My Mom let me read this book (after she read it first) when I was twelve years old. This was back in '89. I've been, like a lot of people who've reviewed this book, a loyal Dean Koontz reader ever since. For sentimental reasons, because this was my first book of his, it still ranks as my favorite. This story has everything. Dean Koontz created characters that have endured over all the years. I can still recite the cast and lines from memory after all this time. Mostly because I've re-read it dozens of times, literally. This period of time, for me, represents Dean Koontz best writing. I'm still loyal after all these years and I still read all of his new books as soon as they come out. However, his novels from the 80's and early 90's are the ones I always go back to when I'm looking to pass the time with a good book. They are as comfortable as being around a good friend. Lightning started it all for me. Thank you Dean Koontz."
Lightning,0425192032,Dean Koontz,Barnes and Noble,4.4,angeleyesAS,"This book is an all-nighter, thoroughly engaging, enchanting, riveting, thought-provoking, heart-wrenching, and heart-racing. This one keeps you guessing throughout with many unexpected surprises and witty humor. 

Koontz is dealing with the here and now, on the border between real and science-fiction. Some of his concepts are not easy to grasp but the powerful, enticing and mind-boggling suspense will keep your eyes glued to the pages. 
 
This is a clever story of time travel and romance, of a German scientist in WWII, who has, along with his comrades, perfected time travel in order to see who will win the war. It starts with a flash of lightning, where a doctor, overly indulging his intake of scotch, receives a phone call from the hospital, informing him that a baby is ready to be delivered. The intoxicated doctor is grabbed by a handsome stranger and is tied up to prevent him from arriving at the hospital. Laura is born successfully but loses her mother. 
Years later, lightning flashes again where the reader meets a young Laura and her father who run a small convenience store, being held at gunpoint by a robber. Suddenly, the same handsome stranger appears and saves the day. Hmmmmm! Sound interesting?
 
The evil of Man, and what Man is capable of is frightening. This story is gripping and action-packed; the characters are believable and engaging; there is love, passion and dedication. Thoroughly entertaining!"
Lightning,0425192032,Dean Koontz,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"This was my first Dean Koontz novel that I ever read.  My brother had read it before me and when I read it, I labeled it as my favorite and still do.  To anyone who had never read Dean Koontz's novels before, this is the first one I reccommend right away.  The feelings it extracts from its readers is phenomenal - my eyes have welled up at parts, a smile presides at others.  An anger with the need for the justice for Laura Shane's hard life is forever present as she takes one hit after another.  The way Stephan helps her through the course of the book is genuinely heartfelt and you can't help but love the man for it.  I've read Lightning many times and I never get tired of it.  It's a great place to start and it will hook you in right away."
"Cat and Mouse (Alex Cross, #4)",1570425779,"James Patterson, Keith David, Anthony Heald",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"I found Cat and Mouse to be very interesting, and it was pretty good considering that it was one of the first books of this genre that I had read.  It is a very suspenseful mystery book that keeps the reader turning the pages.  The style of writing that Patterson used was very understandable and it was easy to keep up with the story.  When I first read this book I thought I already knew what was going to happen, but the story kept me sucked in with turning events and new characters.    	This book is good for readers who do not want the ordinary, predictable story  it is for readers who cannot get enough of a little horror and a lot of suspense.  I would suggest this book to everyone who loves to read.  It contains all the elements of a good story: the imagery, the suspense, and the overall writing.  I think the true mystery behind this book is why people don¿t read Cat and Mouse."
"Cat and Mouse (Alex Cross, #4)",1570425779,"James Patterson, Keith David, Anthony Heald",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"I am reading the Alex Cross series in order and this is my favorite one!  I liked the twists and the love story.  I would like to meet the characters...I think I would like the Cross family, Christine and Sampson.  And I am very glad that villains like Gary Soneji are fictional.  It's a very quick read and difficult to put down.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book!"
"Cat and Mouse (Alex Cross, #4)",1570425779,"James Patterson, Keith David, Anthony Heald",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"James Patterson¿s book, Cat and Mouse, lives up to its title.  This book has many plot twists.  Just when you think you know what is happening, something changes that is unbelievable. This book takes place manly in Washington DC, but journeys off to New York, California, and New Jersey.   A central theme in this book is that nothing is what it seems.  	Cat and Mouse is about a black, DC homicide detective, Dr. Alex Cross, who has a Ph.D. in psychology.  His nickname is the Dragon slayer.  He works in the ghettos of DC; however he takes many large cases from the FBI that they can¿t handle.  In Cat and Mouse, Alex is tracking an old nemesis that escaped from prison, Gary Soneji.  Gary kidnapped a child from his class in a previous book.  However, as he is chasing Gary, he realizes that Gary is actually pursuing him.  He has to keep his guard up because Gary Soneji could be around the corner.    	Alex Cross has many people that are very close to him.  Nana Cross his is grandmother. She is a loving and caring person that looks after Alex.  Alex also has a daughter and a son.  His sons name is Damon; he is very strong for his age.  He has a big mind and takes after his father.  The daughter is Jannie; she is even smarter though younger.  She is also very affectionate.  Another person Alex cares a lot about is John Sampson, his police partner.  John is a very big black man, even bigger than Cross.  He has known Alex since they were children, and have been the best of buds since. Alex also has a woman in his life, Christine. He loves her dearly.  Alex had a wife but she was killed in a drive by shooting.  	This book was one of the best James Patterson books I have read.  The plot is what fascinated me the most, because it had some many turns and twists.  Also the way Patterson writes his books, you just don¿t want to put them down.  Larry King even said ¿I¿ve just started James Patterson¿s Cat and Mouse and I can¿t stop turning pages.¿  However, no book is perfect, during the middle of the book it started to drag on.  I lost my interest, but once I pushed myself to read past it, it became very deep, fascinating, and turned into a great book.  I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys a good police mystery/drama."

"Superfudge (Fudge, #3)",0142408808,Judy Blume,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,I think this is one of the BEST books i have EVER read!!! I recomend it to ayone who wants to read t!!! :)
"Superfudge (Fudge, #3)",0142408808,Judy Blume,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"There are times when life with his brother Farley Drexel 'Fudge' Hatcher makes 12-year-old Peter Hatcher feel like running away. If you ask Peter, 4-year-old Fudge is just a bigger pain in the neck than he ever has been before.   Peter and Fudge are told by their parents Anne and Warren that Anne is pregnant. Peter reacts with anger, because he's afraid that the new baby will turn out to be another Fudge. Whoa! If it turns out that way, How's Peter gonna survive?  As if that thought is not enough, after baby Tamara Roxanne 'Tootsie' Hatcher is born, Anne and Warren announce that the Hatchers will sublet their apartment and move to Princeton, New Jersey for a year to see what it¿s like to live away from New York City, and Warren will be taking a one year leave of absence from the advertising agency to write a book while the Hatchers are in Princeton.   It's bad enough that Peter will be starting sixth grade in an unfamiliar place, but then Anne infuriates Peter by telling Peter that Fudge will be starting Kindergarten in the same school that Peter will be going to, and Peter adamantly refuses to go to the same school as Fudge, but Peter is not given a choice in the matter.  Under these circumstances, Peter thinks he'll absolutely hate spending a year in Princeton. Almost two weeks after the move to Princeton, Peter befriends Alex Santo, who lives across the street and is in Peter's sixth grade class. For Peter, that takes away some of the pain of the situation.  Peter's best friend Jimmy Fargo, whose parents Anita and Frank are now divorced, also regularly visits Peter in Princeton, and at school, Fudge can't get along with his snobby teacher, Mrs. Hildebrandt, so Fudge is transferred to kindly Ms. Ziff's kindergarten classroom, where Fudge befriends a Jewish boy named Daniel Manheim.   Princeton is also the setting for many of Tootsie's firsts. When it comes time to decide whether to go back to their apartment in New York or stay in Princeton, what will the Hatchers decide?     The answer to that question is in this book, and I won't spoil it for you. Unlike Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing, Superfudge has a story line that takes up all 12 chapters, and it's a longer book than Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing was. Superfudge is still a pretty funny book, and it's a good book for all ages. The Fudge series is known for showing the funny side of sibling rivalry."
The Couple Next Door,0735221081,Shari Lapena,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"The overall plot is good, however the writing and the dialogue are seriously lacking.

"Hallowed (Unearthly, #2)",0061996181,Cynthia Hand,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Book_WhispererJO,"Hallowed is a splendid continuation of the Unearthly series. Clara and her family continue on this magical and powerful journey that still leaves the future unclear. Overall Hallowed is an emotionally charged book that will wrap up loose end from Clara's failed purpose, and open the door to what the future holds for this young girl. Tucker and Christian will continue to be a huge obstacle in this second book. As the relationship between Clara and Tucker grows; Clara finds herself facing the most difficult decision yet.  Meanawhile, Christian has been a distraction in the background, but this book steps up his character. Christian is faced with the decision to allow life to pass him by, or reach out and hang on to what fate destined as his. The emotional rollercoaster that entails is eventful and intense to say the least. Although, with a divided fan base of Team Christian's or Team Tucker's mixed emotions will result from this drastic conclusion. This series is rated 8-10 grade, and I concur that this is would be a wonderful read for the younger paranormal lovers; it is clean, innocent, and addictive. With that said I must also point out that I am not of the younger generations, and this is one of my favorite series, so it is one that all ages can love. This is a BookWhisperer Recommendation!!!!!"
"Hallowed (Unearthly, #2)",0061996181,Cynthia Hand,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Sheri_B1975,"It's hard to express and put into words how I feel after reading this book. With Unearthly being an intriguing and captivating start to this series, Hallowed has definitely kicked it up a notch and taken me along on an emotional journey I won't soon forget. That's not always the case when you have such an amazing start to a series like that. Sometimes when you start off that high you can't help but worry that the only place left to go next is down. Well, I hope you're not afraid of heights...

You know how it is in most &quot;love triangle&quot; types of series, how there always seems to be a real cut and dry for everyone. It's either Team BookBoyA or Team BookBoyB and you can usually find some really good solid arguments and evidence to back you up against the opposing guy. I can't do that with Christian and Tucker. They are both agonizingly good guys. I can't say a single negative thing about either of them they are book boyfriend perfection. Both! I mean for once I can actually understand what it's like for someone like Clara to be so torn about her feelings. I get it. I'm not screaming at the book trying to tell her what I think she should do. Or throwing my hands in the air and scoffing in disgust if something even the slightest bit romantic should happen with the guy who's team I'm not backing. Because by the end of the book, our minds are in sync. We both know who she needs to choose. You can't help but love the characters in this book. All of them, even the new ones.  Even through all the twists and turns that this book brings. As you learn more about everyone and secrets are revealed. Things get darker for some and others surprise you. There's still a love there for them.

I probably went through about half a box of tissues with this book. I'm so not joking. I was a total wreck. I love these types of book so much though. I love being so involved and swept away by a story that it can evoke that kind of emotion from me whether it be joy and excitement or even sadness and heartache. These are the kinds of stories that I can read again and again, and I can guarantee you that it will produce the same results from me each time. Hallowed has erased any doubt that these last two books in the series won't be able to hold up to Unearthly. It has me excited to crack open Boundless and see where Cynthia Hand leads me on this journey's end. I'll be sad to see it go, but happier than I was before it began."
"Hallowed (Unearthly, #2)",0061996181,Cynthia Hand,Barnes and Noble,4.4,CaptivatedRding,"I'm glad I chose this book for my first audiobook because if it had been something boring, I may have tuned out a bit. But, as it stands, that was not the case with Hallowed. 

From the very beginning I was enraptured with the story. Clara was a bit different in Hallowed than she was in Unearthly. I see a lot more growth in her in this book, especially at the end. 

Clara goes through SO much in this story and I felt horrible for her. But, there were some redeeming moments, as well. Those made me feel like the was a light at the end of, poor, Clara's maudlin tunnel.

One of the other differences in Hallowed was that there was a lot less Tucker and a lot more Christian. And, while, being--initially--Team Tucker, this bothered me a bit, by the end I felt the &quot;Team&quot; lines blurring. And, sadly, it wasn't really Tucker's fault. We just get to know Christian a little bit better. And, honestly, I love that Ms. Hand did this. I feel like with most love-triangles that both pursuers don't get their fair-share of time. It's usually pretty much stacked in one's favor from the beginning. 

But, because of all this, I now find myself extrememly anxious for the next book in this series. In fact, I may go crazy waiting."
Ancillary Justice (Imperial Radch #1),031624662X,Ann Leckie,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"I'm not certain this will be the Hugo winner in 2014, but I feel confident in predicting that this will be one of the finalists.

Leckie has crafted a gripping space opera story while updating the genre with modern SF sensibilities. She seamlessly integrates her flashback story structure with well-executed immersion into the universe of the Radcha. There's more than a few &quot;We aren't in Kansas anymore&quot; moments scattered throughout the novel which, rather than breaking that immersion, help add to the feeling of being in this place and time.

Her treatment of gender and sexuality is both front and center, but never overbearing. This is partly accomplished by skimping on the physical descriptions of the characters, both primary and secondary, made possible by the unique viewpoint character. She also deftly handles the novel concept of that viewpoint character being, at times simultaneously, a single individual, a gestalt mind bridging 20 individual bodies, and a starship. The story is brought to a satisfying conclusion, but it's clear she has more to tell us about this person and this world; I look forward to seeing the remainder of the tale unfold."
Ancillary Justice (Imperial Radch #1),031624662X,Ann Leckie,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,Peter f. Hamilton's commonwealth books are amazing. Dan Simmons Hyperion books were really good too. Vernor Vinge Deepness in the Sky omg. This.......... I dont get it. I've never disagreed with other reader's reviews before but this is not great writing.
Ancillary Justice (Imperial Radch #1),031624662X,Ann Leckie,Barnes and Noble,4.1,mcummings,"It is no small feat that this is a novel narrated by a selfless AI who is also the most poignant personality. For me, books have flavors, superficial resonances that can usually be expressed verbally as &ldquo;this books reminds me of FOO, but with BAR.&rdquo;

What Ann Leckie has accomplished in her debut novel is to give us a story that has all of the flavor markers and hallmarks of a classic C. J. Cherryh novel from the 1980&rsquo;s, with the poignancy of a contemporary story. The novel is first and foremost a top notched space opera. But what has been fascinating for readers is that the language Leckie has chosen to use bring up questions of gender. This is certainly not the first book to talk to gender &ndash; even LeGuinn&rsquo;s Left Hand of Darkness wasn&rsquo;t the first genre book to go there. Leckie&rsquo;s fresh approach, though, is in giving us a future society where gender is rendered equal not by neutering it, but by neutralizing it. By removing the bisect of male and female and using only the female gender to reference everything, the society of the Radch blurs the line. By submerging Breq, our AI product of Radch society, into other cultures, we begin to see the how arbitrary some attributes of gender are, and how much they can complicate what should otherwise be a simple worldview.

One of the oldest tales is the tale of vengeance. What is justice, then, but vengeance wrought legal? But what if the system, the ruling mind that defines what is right and legal, is itself what has gone awry? Is the vengeance of ancillary component still justice? I am probably reading too much into this play of words between the title and the straightforward goal of Breq, but these are the kinds of thoughts you have when reading Ancillary Justice. Its really refreshing to find a book that satisfies both my simple interests (Space Opera with boom!) while still being thought provoking.

And there was plenty of explosions and gun play. Just in case you were worried.

Ancillary Justice was a wonderful read, and I look forward to more in this series."
"The Pillars of Creation (Sword of Truth, #7)",0765340747,Terry Goodkind,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Sliph,"The problem with this book and why so many people are disappointed with it is because Faith of the Fallen was so amazingly good and truly epic that any other book that comes after is going to be held to that standard and ultimately going to fall short.

This book is a neccessary evil in the series and truly is the balance to the last book. It really makes me wonder if he did it on purpose this way, I honestly wouldn't be surprised. Introducing a whole new set of characters after the last book was a gutsy move and after reading pillars It's easy to see that this story was neccessary to be told in order to build up the rest of the series.

I admit that this one was a slow read for me because lets face it after faith ...yea...this was slow going, BUT im glad that I pushed through and read it because the ending was worth it although it took awhile to get there."
"The Pillars of Creation (Sword of Truth, #7)",0765340747,Terry Goodkind,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Anonymous,"I was pleased the way Mr. Goodkind found new characters and new twists to keep the storyline fresh and interesting. The story within a story is well done and well written; although not very well edited.   I have been very disappointed in the last 3 books with the misspelled words, bad punctuation and grammatical mistakes. It makes it quite difficult sometimes to follow the thought/s of the characters when words are not used to properly convey the the story.  That being said - I would (and have) highly recommend this series!"
"The Pillars of Creation (Sword of Truth, #7)",0765340747,Terry Goodkind,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Anonymous,"I have really enjoyed reading this series.  It has adventure, thrill, excitement, romance, political and moral lessons, drama ... a little of everything.  The characters are developed extremely well and are multi-faceted.  The storyline is original, exciting, and very interesting.  Quotes and lessons from this series are very thought provoking and pertain to all times.  The only con to the series is these books could have used more editing as they get somewhat wordy and repetitive - each book has many sections that explain what happened in previous books - again.  I found myself skimming past those paragraphs and pages.  Overall, they are very well written, and I find myself easily drawn into their world."
Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies,0060566108,"James C. Collins, Jerry I. Porras",Barnes and Noble,4.6,John_Clinton,"Fascinating book and no coincidence that we still talk about it 17 years after it was published.  While some reviewers are criticising that not all companies in the study continue to be successful I think they both miss the point and did not read the author's claims carefully.  They study a group of companies which was exceptionally successful during the observation period. This neither implies that these companies will continue to do well nor does it prevent us to learn from their past experiences. 

What is more of a challenge for the book is the mind frame in which it was written. Authors' are not able to fully escape the main debates of their time (and they probably should not). For 'Built to Last' that means substantial space being devoted to vision and mission (hotly debated in the 1990s). I recommend that you also read 'Enduring Success: what we can learn from the history of outstanding corporations' - a new book that picks up topics we care about today (e.g. innovation versus execution), using the same research approach as 'Built to Last'."

While the books are not one in the same, I did feel as though I may have benefited slightly more by reading this first and Good to Great second.  Either way, these are two must read business books.  A quick summary of Built to Last:

Are you a clock-builder/architect or timekeeper?
Embrace the and, which is the tyranny of the or.
Preserve the core and stimulate progress.
Seek consistent alignment.

Every one of these concepts applies to those look to build their company and succeed in the process.  You will learn a lot about where your company is and what their vision is just by reading this book.  Do they have BHAG's (big, hairy, audacious goals)?  Read and find it.

Collins - a business school professor - decided to do an experiment using the scientific method to identify using stock performance companies that were majorly outperforming peers, then comparing them to sister companies or competitors who were performing on par with the market.

Fireproof,1595547169,Eric Wilson,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,I Love that this story was based around a man trying to save his marriage. In so many books the woman is running around trying win her man. This book made me remember that the little things count more then the big. I would recommend this story to anyone.
Fireproof,1595547169,Eric Wilson,Barnes and Noble,4.1,winmagger,"My wife and I have been together for 9 1/2 years and married for 6 years 7 months.  We started having minor problems that equaled an unfixable relationshiplong due to my ability to change on a simple request.  November 1st it became blatently obvious that she wanted out.  Recieved the book for Christmas from my Mom, we read it simultaneously in two days.  The only reason it took that long was due to work schedules and I didn't want her to read past me.  We both agreed it was an excellent book, only wish they had Children and all 40 days worth of the exercises Caleb used to complete his task.  We still may be headed for divorce, but the book is a great read for anybody in or out of a relationship, as it may fix problems that seem small before they have a chance to destroy a marriage."
Fireproof,1595547169,Eric Wilson,Barnes and Noble,4.1,kdmcalester,Fireproof is about a fireman whose marriage is about to go up in smoke if he does not protect is like he would a building or person from a fire. Fireproof was interesting concept of how to protect your relationship. The concept of fireproofing your relationship is one I don't think most of us thinking about until are relationships starts to smoke. I like how each section of the books was named after things that have to deal with fire. The basis of fireproofing your relationship was based on God so this was more of a Christian fiction book. Although the book had good plot is just lacked in the characters. They were so predictable and whiny that they get on your nervous. Stronger three dimensional characters would really make this a very interesting book. I do not have a lot of desire to read any more books by Eric Wilson especially if they are written after a movie. When a book follows the movie it can't be that great. I guess it was more of how to save your marriage especially if you do not have strong relationship with the Lord Our Savior. The biggest lesson in the book is you must have a relationship with God in order to lover your spouse totally. I would recommend the Love Dare for a person struggling with marriage issues which these novel talks about and is Forty day Journey.
"The Lunatic Cafe (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter #4)",0425201376,Laurell K. Hamilton,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"The Anita Blake series is by far my favorite series out there. The complex personalities and evolution of the characters is amazing. Laurell K. hamilton writes a book that creates a whole new world for us to get sucked into. Once you pick up one of her books, you can't put it down. And once you finish one you just have to immediately start the next one."
"The Lunatic Cafe (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter #4)",0425201376,Laurell K. Hamilton,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Danielle084,"Another great one from Laurell. This series is drawing me in the more and more I read it. With more characters, exciting twist and turns and the adventure and excitment that Anita Blake seems to get herself into really captures the moment. With a twist of a love story this series is a must read from book 1 to 17!"
"The Lunatic Cafe (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter #4)",0425201376,Laurell K. Hamilton,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"Anita Blake is always a great read from cover to cover. I have read every one that has been written. They need to be read in sequence to get the full effect and growth of the chacters. My advice is to buy them all and start from the start, they are worth the expense. I have read and reread my set every time she puts a new book out.A Fabulouse Writer! A must have for all vampire fans!"
"John Dies at the End (John Dies at the End, #1)",0978970764,David Wong,Barnes and Noble,4.5,ratdude,"When I first read the original weekly installments on the internet, I lost a day's productivity at work each week.  Not that it took me a day to read it - I'm a slow reader but not THAT slow.  It's that it stuck with me, it crept around in my head all day making me suddenly laugh out loud one moment and other times causing me to quickly turn my head to catch a glimpse of a shadow that I was sure I had seen out of the corner of my eye but now wasn't there.  It drew me in to it's world.  By the end of the day I had rationalized it enough that I was OK.  Until the next week.  Then when the book came out (not this one, a limited release under a different publisher) I was lucky enough to get it signed by the author.  He even drew a little unsmiley face on it.  I'd describe it to you but I haven't checked it today to see what it currently looks like.  I keep the book on a shelf behind my computer at home where I can always see it.  Not because I pick it up and re-read it often.  Because I want to make sure I always know where it is, in just that specific cockeyed position, so I know that no one else in the house but me has read it.  Because I love my family.

The book (and just to be clear, I use that word with reluctance, since those of us who have read it know that...well I can't explain it, nevermind) is about a couple of friends, John and Dave, who live in a midwestern town.  You may identify with one or the other of them at various points in the story...especially with John if you have a large genital member, a large ego, and little appreciation for the fact that actions have consequences.  Uh, unless you're a chick, in which case scratch that genital member part...wait that didn't quite come out the way I meant it. Um, Anyhow, the plot..So these two friends end up imbibing ""Soy Sauce"" - a drug that opens up the supernatural world to your senses - and they realize that their town is basically the beachhead for a supernatural invasion.  They encounter unbelievable horror, some of the really gross kind and some of the really ""shocks-the-mind-into-numbness-and-disbelief"" kind.  And they also encounter unbelievable comedy, some of the really gross kind and some of the really ""makes-you-laugh-even-though-its-inappropriate-to-do-so-right-now"" kind.  And they often encounter both horror and comedy at the same moment.  The story is good.  It's so good you won't want to put the book down.  And sometimes you'll just be too scared to put it down.  It must truly be read to be understood.  But once you understand, it won't leave you alone.  In fact, it's already too late for you.  You're reading these reviews, so you're in the game.  THEY know you're reading these reviews, and THEY won't leave you alone now.  I'm so sorry."
"John Dies at the End (John Dies at the End, #1)",0978970764,David Wong,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"Like Burroughs, Vonnegut, and Lovecraft had a baby and that baby got whiskey drunk, took a handful of Adderall and stayed up for3 days writing a horror novel."
"John Dies at the End (John Dies at the End, #1)",0978970764,David Wong,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Thomas_Gilroy,"From the moment I read the dedication, I knew that this was the book for me.

When I finished the Prologue, there was no question of whether or not I would enjoy it.

But when I try to explain John Dies at the End, I am forced to end with ""Just... read it, okay?"" The book leaps over genres with feckless abandon and changes pace at a brilliant, though never sickening, speed, like a peregrine falcon wearing a dust jacket. 

I could take a moment to crudely carve out various possible niches for the book. It will fit ""comedy"" and ""horror"", but not perfectly, which is the problem (and beauty) of David Wong's work: any attempt to classify it always feels wrong, like a diploma displayed on a slant or a bike trail added to a narrow road.

In fact, the best piece of advice I could offer a potential reader is this: the book is not a Capital Letter Genre book. It is not a Horror book, but it contains horror. It is not a Comedy novel, although the book will reduce you to quaking with silent mirth, as you are too busy laughing to even make noise. It is not a Romantic novel, but characters fall in love. I could go on.

To put it simply, the book is more than the total of its parts. It is too big, too bold, too wonderful, to be contained by descriptors. I could tell you that the book has jokes and scary moments, but it is so much more than a book with jokes and scary moments. It is a book that can only be defined by itself. I will put this next sentence in a new paragraph, where it can be clearly seen:

Do not let any part of this book, or any genre that it is listed as, scare you away from it.

To elaborate: if you do not like horror, buy it. If you are not looking for humor, get it. If you don't feel like thinking, read it. Yes, it will scare you, and yes, it will make you laugh, and yes, it will make you think. But in the end it will not matter, because you will be glad that you have read this book.

What makes Wong's writing so powerful is, again, hard to classify. It is not his comedic timing (which is brilliant), and it is not his characterization (though it is impeccable). If I was pressed for one explanation, it would be his understanding--of human behavior, of human emotion, of reality, of fantasy.

If you don't believe me, just look at this review I am writing, here. I have tried several times to explain why I think you should read this book, and I am not sure I have done the job.

I know I have barely touched on the book's plot, except in vague terms. I have to weigh including details against the space I have for recommending it, and I'm trying (and failing) to hit all the points briefly before running out of room.

But look at how hard I've tried. It's taken me forever to write this review, to re-read it, to re-type it, to slave over each phrasing.

So if you want any evidence of how powerful this book is, look no further than this. Whether or not you are inspired by my praise, it exists, and I have devoted a considerable amount of time to writing it.

It would seem that it is important to me that you think about buying this book. And it is. I really, truly care about whether or not you buy this book, because I like it, and I am convinced that you will like it as well. I've spent my time on this because John Dies at the End is not only a book, but a book that is fantastic, incredible, and entertaining, and that has inspired at least one person to type out the maximum number of charac"
The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark,0345409469,"Carl Sagan, Ann Druyan",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"This is absolutely one of the finest works demonstrating the difference between the process of science and the body of knowledge we have gained through its use.  Sagan uses the phrase 'baloney detection toolkit' several times in this book, and it applies wonderfully across the spectrum of experience in our lives.  When applied to the claims of various types of cultural environment, the practices he points out can easily help individuals see through the fraudulent claims of those who would pretend to use 'science' to 'prove' their pet theory.      As a walk through history, this book also shows how people have been misled terribly by persons whose vested interest lies in such deception.  For this reason alone it is worth reading, as the similarities between many of those past situations and those occurring today do show that history certainly does have a habit of repeating itself.      This book is a wonderful tool for developing the one thing that will help you throughout your entire life:  a skeptical mind.  Not a cynical one, a skeptical one.      I can't give this book higher ratings - or I would.  I try to always keep two extra copies around to give to friends who might appreciate it.  Do yourself a favor, and pick it up."

Something people are very confused about especially when they are constantly being bombarded by unreliable information through the media and when new age and irrational thinking continue to thrive and even be 'trendy'.

The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark,0345409469,"Carl Sagan, Ann Druyan",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,This is one of the most refreshing and interesting books I've read.  Throughout the entire book Sagan eloquently explains away many ideas that run our lives.  The massive amount of rhetorical questions are the icing on the cake.  Sagan's skepticism and ability to 'detect baloney' are qualities that are greatly needed in our society.  Sagan is MY candle in the dark.
Prozac Nation,1573225126,Elizabeth Wurtzel,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,A decent portrayal  of mental illness.
Prozac Nation,1573225126,Elizabeth Wurtzel,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,prozac nation is by far one of the best books i've ever read. this book is not about whining or making you feel sorry for the author like i've read in other reviews. it's about someone who has struggled most of their life through depression and addiction and takes the time to take the reader in depth into of every aspect of her life. i read this book a few years ago and it is still one of my favorite books. once you start reading you can't stop. this book itself is a drug. you will be hooked instantly. you will find yourself ignoring phone calls food and sleep to get to the next page. This book should be read by everyone. but i think someone who has experienced depression or addiction at some point in their life will appreciate this book even more.
Prozac Nation,1573225126,Elizabeth Wurtzel,Barnes and Noble,4.3,peptastic on LibraryThing,I read this a decade ago. I learned a valuable lesson about what makes a gentlemen should I ever need it. A nice guy pays for your abortion but a gentlemen will take you to the clinic as well. I haven't need this wisdom but I've imparted it to others. The saddest thing I found about this book was Wurtzel's belief people only sympathise with drug addicts but can't understand depression. I'm not sure if this is true with everyone but she later became an addict. I wonder if people knew what to do with her then or if she still found that people often don't relate or sympathise with others pain even with a reason to put a name to.It seems to me that drug addictio. only makes peoples lives so much harder to deal with. Relatives I know who added drug addiction to their depression still had the depression to deal with.
The Black Cauldron (The Chronicles of Prydain #2),080508049X,Lloyd Alexander,Barnes and Noble,4.2,The_hibernators,"The Black Cauldron is the second book of the Chronicles of Prydain. In it, the hero Taran once again needs to leave home and have adventures-this time to regain the powerful zombifying Black Cauldron from the Death Lord. Very cute."
The Black Cauldron (The Chronicles of Prydain #2),080508049X,Lloyd Alexander,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"I used to watch the Disney movie The Black Cauldron all of the time. It wasn't till recently that I discovered it was an actual book series. The series is five books, and so far this is my favorite one. Lloyd Alexander vividly gives the reader an up close and personal view of all of the characters personality. By giving such a clear description of everything and everyone's personality you can easily vision everyone's expressions, and the tone of the environment. I believe the plot was excellent. I am not necessarily a fan of books where there is travel or a journey, they somewhat bore me. The black cauldron did have a journey however Lloyd Alexander kept it short and sweet and very exciting. The battle sequences were intense and you just imagined the force and desire for victory. One thing that frustrated me about the book was all of the betrayal. It got me mad and I almost wanted to shred the book sometimes. However all of the betrayal did bring forth a lot of lessons, such as when people have too much power they tend to abuse it. I can really relate that to some of today's issues all across the world. I immediately thought about how easy it is too loose a good person if they fall off the curb. The witches in the story were undoubtedly my favorite characters. They were funny and did not necessarily take sides. The setting is in a land named Prydain. It obviously has a setting similar to northern Europe. Most all of the characters along with most of the objects in the story are based off of Welsh mythology, such as Arwan, Gwydion, the black Cauldron, and the kingdom of Llyr. I sometimes find it difficult to pronounce the names, but have no fear there is a convenient pronunciation guide in the back. The great thing I think about this book series is the fact that it leaves a lot of unanswered questions, which we may or may not find out. And Alexander clearly loves cliff hangers. At the end of the book he doesn't really end it; he just seems to take a pause. I have also begun to read the Castle of Llyr and it started up right where the Black Cauldron left off. You will constantly find yourself hoping and praying for all of the characters safety. And you just want them to be alright. You really begin to bond with them almost as though you were there.I respect Lloyd Alexander a lot. He brings the world of Prydain to life. He has written a review even for the book Wicked, it is right there on the back if you are curious. I definitely plan to finish this sires and will continue to read Lloyd Alexander's books. All in all, I strongly recommend this book for people who are looking for a good leisurely read about valor and honor. You may just find yourself looking for an adventure of your own."
The Black Cauldron (The Chronicles of Prydain #2),080508049X,Lloyd Alexander,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"Each of us must grow up and transition between childhood and adulthood. Taran, an assistant pig-keeper, wants to grow up, but hardships he never expected come flying into his life. He must make decisions that will determine his future, if he survives.  	I really enjoyed reading this book that is filled with a tangled web of character opinions of what is right and wrong.  It is a fast paced book that addresses some of the hardships teenagers face in today¿s world while keeping a magical setting.  Throughout the course of the story, Taran must make decisions that affect not only his life, but the lives of his friends as well.  He must choose between right and wrong, good and evil, and must face the consequences of his actions, sometimes at a very great price to him and his friends.  	 It is a very well written book that addresses some of life¿s most serious issues, such as right and wrong, good and evil, and accepting responsibility and consequences for ones actions.  It shows the consequences of evil and what can happen if it is allowed to thrive in a community.  Another reason I really enjoyed this book is there is no offensive language or extremely graphic scenes.  I would recommend this book to everyone who enjoys suspenseful fiction."
The First Phone Call from Heaven,0062294377,Mitch Albom,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Heart2Heart,"The Week It Happened...

On the day the world received its first phone call from heaven, Tess Rafferty was unwrapping a box of tea bags. 

Drrrnnn!

She ignored the ring and dug her nails into the plastic. 

Drrrnnn!

She clawed her forefinger through the bumpy part on the side. 

Drrrnnn!

Finally, she made a rip, then peeled off the wrapping and scrunched it in her palm. She knew the phone would go the answering machine if she didn't grab it before one more -

Drrrnnn -

&quot;Hello?&quot;

Too late. 

&quot;Ach, this thing,&quot; she mumbled. She heard the machine click on her kitchen counter as it played her outgoing message. 

&quot;Hi, it's Tess. Leave your name and number. I'll get back to you as soon as I can, thanks.&quot;

A small beep sounded. Tess heard static. And then. 

&quot;It's Mom...I need to tell you something.&quot;

Tess stopped breathing. The receiver fell from her fingers. 

Her mother died four years ago. 

In the latest novel from best selling author Mitch Albom, he was more has created a longing in the heart for so many who wish for just one more phone call or a way to talk to those who have died. Only it isn't just Tess who is getting the phone calls, it is others in the small town of Coldwater, Michigan. Those once lost in their grief are finding comfort in the short simple phone calls conveying that everything is perfect and that those loved ones are calling from heaven and they want everyone to know about it. 

Amy Penn was hoping to finally get the one big break all reporters long for and when she gets the assignment to investigate the phone calls from dead people coming to those residents only in the town of Coldwater, Amy wonders if she is being sent on a wild goose chase because if she fails, the station doesn't have to worry about what the ratings will do. No one knows who she is anyway. But will Amy find more than she truly ever bargained for? Is this God's way of leading her down a much different path then she ever dreamed possible?

You'll have to pick up this book to find out. If you've read Mitch Albom's other books, The Five People You Meet in Heaven or Tuesdays With Morrie, then you will definitely WANT this one. It's guaranteed to keep you wondering long after you finish the final page. In my opinion, this one hands down gets a 5 out of 5 stars. I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review and the opinions expressed here are strictly my own. This was a self purchase and being a huge book lover, I had to read this one. What a great Christmas gift!"

She is now one of my favorite authors. It is so easy to see why she is the Queen of Crime. This name of the book sounded interesting, so decided to read it.  I loved it!  The plot was wonderfully unique, the twist completely surprising, and the detective, of course, sheer genius. Only Hercule Poirot could be this clever. I recommend this book to any mystery lover!"

You get into the book and you think that you know who the murderer is but at the end it takes a total twist it is a great book if you are getting bored with the Nancy Drew books.
"The A.B.C. Murders (Hercule Poirot, #13)",1579126243,Agatha Christie,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"This is my first Agatha Christie book and I really enjoyed reading it. It is not like the normal mystery suspense book I normally read. It was extremely easy to tell that she was the queen of mysteries. The ABC murders were quite twisted because of the serial killers mind set. I would rate this book a 9 out of 10 only because a couple of the pages were quite dull, but needed to be in the book so that the reader would have a better understanding. I felt the best part was when the investigators found a common theme of the murders was the victims names started with the letters ABC and E because of mistaken identity. Also he was selling stockings at all the places of victim's houses. Selling stockings back then was a very common job so the killer didn't seem out of the ordinary. Every witness had a different look at the killer and had no distinguishing characteristics about him. He would also leave an ABC railroad guide to distinguish it wasn't a random murder but serial killing's. I wanted to read this book because when I read the description of the ABC killings it was very thrilling. I actually thought that the book had occurred in Rochester New York because the same plot happened in later years. Turns out the crimes in this book happened in Europe. There were some parts in the book where I couldn't understand what was happening do the fact that a sentence or a phrase was in a different language. I would recommend this book to anybody who enjoys reading about murders and investigators who try to solve the crimes. Almost all the investigators since the beginning said that the murders would not turn into killing streak it was a random murder. But one investigator really new what he was doing once he had one suspect and evidence against him he didn't quit he found the real killer.   If you plan on reading this book you may want to read the beginning pages about the characters for a better understanding there is multiple characters and investigators that come into play throughout the book. 

ABC Murders by Agatha Christie"
"Lover Reborn (Black Dagger Brotherhood, #10)",0451235843,J.R. Ward,Barnes and Noble,4.6,MotherMayhem,"I've waited for the story of Tohr to come full circle since Lassiter found him in the woods. He is so important to all the Brothers, and with his spirit being broken, they are all a little incomplete. I know it is hard for fans to move on from Wellsie, but it had to happen and I think it makes for an excellent story and JR Ward did a great job. Tohr is often a jackass to No'One, but she always defends herself, how can that not be respected? They are both hurting and punishing themselves. Everything that happened in this story, needed to happen, and the outcome was worth it. No'One has her own journey to take and it is so important to Tohr's, Lassiter's, and to Xhex's future. I think the sub-plot of John and Xhex is so important and true to their characters. Xhex may have choosen to follow her heart with John by mating him in Lover Mine, but she still had to find her place in the Brotherhood that fits her. Xhex and No'One also had to develope their relationship and find how they fit together- they each offered the other unconditional acceptance and love. It is actually the most beautiful part of the book. I have to say, I love Lassiter and Layla and always have. Lover Reborn gives us a different view of them (for different reasons), and they both grow in depth and direction and offer a lot to the story. There is a lot going on in this book, and it is all important to keep the story going in the future. The writing is tight and organized. I for one am not ready for the series to end, so the changes and introduction of new characters are important to the longevity of the story; and I like them and look forward to seeing how it all plays out. 

Now here's my rant- we are ten books into a series that features several complicated long term plot lines, many players, and a whole city built by JR Wards imagination. I'm tired of the reviews complaining that none of the books have been the same since book five. Duh!! How could they be? The first five served as world building, singular romances-featuring one hero and his HEA, but the series could not continue from that point focusing on only one male and female and ignore the previous characters, and the world of Caldwell that was ever more complicated. Ward always shows a great amount of passion and love for her characters, some get a little more nurturing than others (what writer doesn't do the same?) What the heck people? If you want only the standard contemporary romance formula, look elsewhere, and stop sucking the enjoyment of this series from the rest of us."
"Lover Reborn (Black Dagger Brotherhood, #10)",0451235843,J.R. Ward,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Ozzy12,"Loved it. Great book, great story. I was very entertained."
"Lover Reborn (Black Dagger Brotherhood, #10)",0451235843,J.R. Ward,Barnes and Noble,4.6,PNWLulu,"Lover Reborn opens 15 months after the death of Tohr's bonded mate of 200 years, Wellesandra (Wellsie), with Tohr still suffering greatly.  To kick start his reluctant relationship with No'One (Xhex's mother who committed suicide but was reanimated by the Scribe Virgin about 300 years earlier and who has spent these years wallowing in self-hatred), Ward puts Tohr on a timetable by trapping Wellsie &quot;In Between&quot; and has the angel Lassiter tell Tohr that he needs to fall in love to free her and his unborn child. The book is really all about Tohr's pain and he spends a lot of it being cruel to No'One. There is not much in the way of actual romance and No'One herself seems quite intentionally the blandest female of the series, the polar opposite of Wellsie, and one who readily acknowledges that what Tohr had with Wellsie was a once in a lifetime love.  As the story progresses, Tohr isn't in love with No'One and then suddenly . . . he is! In a rushed ending, he gives away Wellsie's things, sells their house, apologizes to No'One, and invites her to Wellsie's Fade Ceremony. Tohr's feelings of profound grief and No'One's self-hatred which were pretty well done to this point, are both put aside from almost one page to the next as if it were as simple as deciding not to feel that way any more and ultimately made the rushed &quot;I love you's&quot; at the end unconvincing. Turns out it was Tohr who was actually holding Wellsie back by refusing to let go, so she and his unborn son are now able to move on to the Fade.

Ward's world building has always had issues with clarity and now crumble in a rushed conclusion falling back on deus ex machina plot devices, as No'One herself has apparently also been trapped In Between but is saved just moments after Wellsie has moved on to the Fade with a sacrifice by Lassiter that is not revealed. If there was ever a story that truly needed the world building to be clearly explained, this was it. There should have been a good reason for No'One to receive her life back, not just that she forgave herself and was available for Lassiter to save. But no explanations are forthcoming and even though Ward must have surely known for years how some readers would react to a solution that lacked some sense of fairness, the bottom line appears to be that No'One (a resurrected suicide) gets to live while Wellsie (a murder victim) has to stay dead because that was their destiny. Though most readers are certainly aware that life isn't fair, they should be forgiven if they would prefer a bit more fun and escapism in their fictional vampire romance novels.

In Lover Reborn, Ward moves further into urban fantasy with multiple storylines, more emotional pain and much less romance. Since it isn't possible for Tohr to bond again, there is no bonding scent, no &quot;mine&quot; moment, and the ending is more along the lines of happy-for-now, with Wellsie awaiting Tohr in the Fade. Though nobody expects rainbows and unicorns from Ward, it doesn't seem too much to hope for more joy and escapism, especially since so many other characters have been allowed to cheat death including No'One (renamed &quot;Autumn&quot;). The message that you can recover from tragedy and find a measure of happiness is fine, but didn't resonate given the ultimately unconvincing Tohr/No'One relationship, along with the distraction of the contrived plot and truly poor world building. Most definitely not a romance with a couple that should both be heading to therapy instead of mating.  1 star."
"The Duke and I (Bridgertons, #1)",0380800829,Julia Quinn,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"I have been sampling historical romances (about fifty authors in all) and this easily changed my views that the genre contains content not worthy of commentary. With multi-dimensional main characters, a simple yet thoroughly engaging plot, and excellent writing, this first 'Bridgerton' has captivated me enough to get a Nook, simply to be able to access the entire series. Julia Quinn is easily one of my favorite authors."
"The Duke and I (Bridgertons, #1)",0380800829,Julia Quinn,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"The way Dafne shows her emotions didn't sound disgusting nor exaggerated.  She still have innocence but with a spark if naive naughtiness... Her actions are believable, understandable &amp; practical considering the situation Simon is in, well.. the situation, they're both in.  I also liked the idea that Simon &amp; Dafne started as friends then developed into something deeper.  They shared thoughts &amp; dreams as well as fears &amp; insecurities. They understood each other before words are passed, they formed a special bond before marriage - this is somewhat unusual in historical romances novels that I have read so far.  I would like to mention my teeny bitty complaint about this story though, I wondered what happened to Nurse Hopkins. She who supposedly loved and took care of Simon ever since he was a baby. I would have loved to read about her. It would be nice to read her proud reaction to see what Simon had accomplished. Since she was the encouragement &amp; Simon's maternal support, it would have been nice to see her involved in Simon's life all throughout the book. Oh well, this is just a small flaw which I thought I'd mention.
Oh it won't be fair not to mention the famous Lady Whistledown's gossip column.  My!  Not only is she mysteriously accurate, she is so funny.  Her column is one of my favorites in this book. This was my first (certainly not my last) Julia Quinn book and I was highly impressed with her ability to create characters who don't always speak and behave the way you expect them too. Daphne and Simon's relationship is believable, they seem like &quot;real&quot; people and their problems were fairly ordinary and not overly dramatic or contrived. The secondary characters each deserve (and will probably get) a book of their own. Quinn also had a knack for making me laugh -- the humor was not forced or too cutesy, just well written. Although this book is set in the Regency period, it is not your &quot;traditional&quot; Regency as it does contain some frank sex scenes and the characters often act with a more modern sensibility than one might expect. In any case, this was a great read and I am eagerly looking forward to reading Quinn's other novels."
"The Duke and I (Bridgertons, #1)",0380800829,Julia Quinn,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Angel_Caido,"Julia Quinn's The Duke and I was one of those books that swept me off my feet, and made me fall in love with Regency Romance novels. I find her books to be pure romance, along with a comedic twist, that makes you longing for more. Once I was done with this, I had to read the rest of the Bridgerton family novels. To the reader, I guarantee that once you begin to read this book, you will not be disappointed!"
"Maisie Dobbs (Maisie Dobbs, #1)",0142004332,Jacqueline Winspear,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"I recommend this book to everyone. Classified as a mystery, it transends any one genre with its psychological and spiritual overtones, class struggle, and battlefield scenes woven nicely into the dire circumstances of WWI Europe. And, oh yes, there is a mystery to be solved.    Jackie Winspear has created a believable,admirable character in Maisie Dobbs. The reader pulls for her while racing through the well-crafted story.    Maisie Dobbs should move right to the bestseller list along with The Secret Life of Bees and The No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency.    Winspear was nominated for an Edgar, and won an Agatha for Maisie Dobbs. I'm looking forward to her next book, Birds of A Feather."
"Maisie Dobbs (Maisie Dobbs, #1)",0142004332,Jacqueline Winspear,Barnes and Noble,4.1,genej101,"I first noticed Ms. Winspear when the last book in this series, so far, was atop the best sellers list.  I bought the first in the series, read it, loved it and immediately purchased the entire remaining set.  I couldn't recommend it more highly.  I knew a lot about the conditions in Germany between the World Wars but very little, as it turns out, about the conditions in England.  Ms. Winspear's meticulous research and historically accurate depiction of life in England during that period makes the books worth reading for that reason alone.  That they are also outstanding mysteries with that compelling can't-put-down quality is an amazing bonus.  There are few authors who I buy in hardcover, preferring to wait for the paperback but Ms. Winspear is now among that elite list for me, when she publishes, I want the book NOW.  The vernacular takes some getting used to but it in no way detracts from the story or the history.  Wonderful reading."
"Maisie Dobbs (Maisie Dobbs, #1)",0142004332,Jacqueline Winspear,Barnes and Noble,4.1,pjpick,"I'm not one for mysteries and not one for serials. I purchased this one to send to my mom, but as I was looking for an easy read and this one was in reach I cracked it open to take a gander. Well, it was a pleasant surprise! It didn't take long before I found myself engrossed in the life of Maisie Dobbs.

As this is the first in the Maisie Dobbs series, it was light on the mystery and heavy on the ""set up"" and history for the series (which could be why I liked it so much). It also felt like I was reading an episode of Masterpiece Theatre--which I absolutely love. Maisie seems like somone I would have as a friend and Winspear's writing gave me strong images of WWI post-WWI England. Finally, the last two pages had me sobbing like a baby. Kudos Winspear for such a lovely story! I look forward to book #2."
"Forever in Blue: The Fourth Summer of the Sisterhood (Sisterhood, #4)",0385729367,Ann Brashares,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Twiteen,"I have to say this book was amazing. The character's really seem to find themselves in this book. It is true the ending leaves something to be desired but overall it was a great read. My favorite story would have to be Bridget's. After losing her mother, and as a teenager reconnecting with her grandmother to find herself again in the previous books, in this book she learns it's okay to miss someone. Something that she's had to lock up for quite some time. She steps back and look at her family a relizes she has to do something about her brother who spends to much time in his room and her distracted father.
 Lena's tragic love story with her Greek ex-boyfriend, Kustos, alway's leaves me wondering what's going to happen next. The things the author comes up with are always surprising. It's a true  romantic drama, full of twists, lies, promises, and the hard truth of love that is so strong but just not meant to be.
 Tibby has to find the love she feels for her once a nerd now a hunk boyfriend again. I was frustrated with  her for breaking his heart and breaking up with him, but still dosn't feel happy. I got angry at her for telling Effie she was okay with her and Brian going out and then taking  him back just because he wasn't available any more, but angry at her as I was I couldn't help but relate to her. Sometimes you have to lose something to realize how much you actually love it.
 And Carmen. Missing her friends she starts to lose the very essence of who she is. I think it's something a lot of people can relate to. Being in an unfamiliar place with unfamiliar faces, having your so called friend turn out to be a witch who's only happy when you fail. Well okay maybe that last part is to specific :)
 But the ending in my opinion is a little vague, but maybe that was the authors point. To leave it open for the reader to decide what next. If that were the case the possibilities are endless. It still amazes me that the base of the story is just four freinds with a pair of pants."
"Forever in Blue: The Fourth Summer of the Sisterhood (Sisterhood, #4)",0385729367,Ann Brashares,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"Loved it!!!

In this fourth book these sisters go through all the normal young adult ways. With the help of the Pants though of course.

"The Millennium Trilogy (Millennium Trilogy, #1-3)",0307594777,"Stieg Larsson, Reg Keeland",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,I absolutely love the trilogy.  I love the characters and was hooked the first few chapters.  It is a little slow but the wait is worth it.
"The Millennium Trilogy (Millennium Trilogy, #1-3)",0307594777,"Stieg Larsson, Reg Keeland",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Ladema,"This is an excellent trilogy that is definitely worth the time to read.  The characters are unique, the plot is original, and some very good thought was put into the progression.  The entire series keeps you hooked and guessing.  It's fun and entertaining while still remaining thought provoking.  It has a fantastically liberal view on women that is refreshing to read, and deals with sexual persecution without sounding preachy.

The few downsides to the series, I think, are in the writing style.  Perhaps lost in translation, but the style is rather bland at times, using no symbolism or metaphor or alliteration or any tiny details you might expect in a published novel.  It in general straightforwardly tells you the story in third person limited while switching between the characters.  The true insight into the characters are minimal, and in general they act in a predictable manner once their characteristics are established.  That's not to say that the individual characters are uninteresting, just slightly one-sided.  It probably would be a poor choice to read in an English class, but it makes a fantastic read for the general population."

A nice collection of short essays reflecting back on his travels 20 years earlier, as well as describing his return visit more recently.

Boy Meets Boy,0375832998,David Levithan,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"I've never felt compelled to post a review until now.  I discovered this wonderful story while reading two articles in the 2/09 issue of School Library Journal - David Levithan was quoted in ""A Dirty Little Secret"", an article about self-censorship (where books are being quietly kept from their target audience because of issues that others - parents, teachers, librarians, even booksellers - deem inappropriate for whatever reason ...  although as a parent and a middle school library volunteer, I feel that Boy Meets Boy is totally appropriate for middle school+ libraries, and I will be purchasing an extra copy for our library.)   It was also mentioned in another article featuring an author's ten favorite romantic YA novel moments as the book with the ""Headiest Falling In (and out of) Love Scenes"".  Okay, so it's mentioned twice in the same magazine, so I had to read it!  Love it, love it, love it!   Boy Meets Boy is a coming of age love story first and foremost (and let me emphasize love - it is remarkably chaste, in my official parental opinion).   More importantly, it is brilliantly written and filled with some important messages about self discovery, tolerance, what love should be and what it should not be.  It made me think, and that's one of the top reasons why I read.  Will it offend some?  Of course - it already has, just read some of the one star reviews here, but their main complaint is that it features gay characters.  This is a book for any open minded person, male or female, gay or straight, teen or adult.  Thank you, David Levithan - you are a truly gifted storyteller!"

We Are Water,0061941026,Wally Lamb,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"I have read all of this author's works, this one fell far to short of my expectations. In fact, i have read them all at least twice. Each of this author's prior works have left me with en epiphany unique to each story, with the exception of ""A Wishing and a Hoping""' which was just fun all the way around.
Wally Lamb has previously written books that address a wide array of evocative, important issues such as mental illness, abuse, racism, and other issues that, if you had lived during his time references, one could relate and place within one's own life experiences, and he wrote it tight, and he wrote it well; well enough for me to not pick up another book right away but for me to think on and ponder over for  time.
He took care with his words.
I miss this in his new book, and i feel that he sold short in this book. Basically, his characters are difficult to follow in this book. Almost all of them have the same voice. I had read that this author took great pride in writing from a woman's perspective in ""She's Come Undone"". He missed the mark here.
Characters that would have fleshed out well was the KKK man's wife. That chapter was excellent. I could picture that woman spying in a movie theatre, she was authentic. He should have followed that wpman's daughter's story more. She knew the murdered Joe J. It is never followed thru except when she reappears at the end of the story. What a missed opportunity for a story line.
Instead, the book becomes weighted down with excessive and pointless conversations. 
How he handles the sexual abuse of a child, how he directs her life thru her sexual experimenting and eventual marriage to  a psychologist, has three children, abuses her own child while creating angry art. Then she becomes attracted to the owner of the gallery and marries her.
It is difficult tp like this woman who destroys the life of her  family. I empathize with children who are abused and sexually molested. However, she is the first person to abuse her own son. She is redeemed by being at her exhusband's side during something the reader sees coming a mile away but as at other times in this book, the author withholds so much of the parts in the story it feels as though his timing is off.
As noted earlier, it feels as though his heart wasn't in this one.
As if he was so busy being politically correct that he truly sacrifices the story line.
I truly hope his next book is better. 
It was interesting, but not enough to make me want to pick it up again..........Caren1977"
We Are Water,0061941026,Wally Lamb,Barnes and Noble,3.9,RebeccaScaglione,"I received this book in exchange for a fair and honest review from TLC Book Tours, which was fabulous because, I mean, I was able to get a WALLY LAMB book!!!  Score! 

We Are Water by Wally Lamb is an emotional book about what it means to be a family.  It is also a book of secrets.

Annie Oh is a famous artist who left her husband, Orion Oh, after over 20 years of marriage in order to marry her lover Vivica.  Annie has some anger that fuels her art, coming from deep seeded secrets that no one knows.

Orion also has some anger.  He&rsquo;s angry that Annie left him, angry that she is going to remarry in their hometown. . . Then there&rsquo;s Ariane, the goody goody daughter, and her twin brother Andrew who is born again, and their younger sister Marissa who is the struggling actress.  All three siblings have their own secrets and life struggles to work out.

Annie&rsquo;s approaching wedding brings the family together, and forces them to be honest with their secrets.

We Are Water by Wally Lamb is a more subtle read.  I enjoyed it, and would recommend it to fans of his novels.  However, I do have to say that She&rsquo;s Come Undone and I Know This Much Is True were less subtle and really grabbed me.

I had a few issues with pieces of Lamb&rsquo;s writing.  Sometimes it was fabulous, but I wasn&rsquo;t a fan of some of the stream of consciousness paragraphs, as well as there being parts of the book with way too much dialogue.

Thanks for reading, 

Rebecca @ Love at First Book"
We Are Water,0061941026,Wally Lamb,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Humbee,"This is a very difficult review for me to write.  I've thought about it for a couple of days now and wondered if I'd get it down right for you.  I've been an avid fan of Wally Lamb's for many, many years and had such excitement when I learned he had a new book out.  I rushed to get a copy.  I'm sad to say this one was a disappointment to me in some major ways, although I did grasp the over all story and could appreciate what Mr. Lamb's intention was in telling it.  (See Summary above)

 

This is first of all a long book that became increasingly a drain to read as I found it less engaging.  It was mostly a stream of consciousness novel, and I'm not fond of that writing style (I've never been a James Joyce fan) so the 570 some pages became a torture that I seemed never to make headway on. I began to dread picking the book up.  Does this tell you something?

 

While I expected it to be a book that was focused more on the story of a lesbian couple, it really wasn't.  It's more a story of a wildly dysfunctional and bleeding family told mostly from the perspective of a wildly dysfunctional psychologist father.  Which would have been fine if it were interesting...  

 

While the book is divided into chapters/segments written from the minds and voices of the different characters, it weighed heavily on the view of the father of the family, it seemed to me.

I found I couldn't feel an affinity with any of these characters.  For the most part they were a very whiny and self-serving bunch...self-absorbed in their different psychosis's.  It became a downer.  It wasn't a pleasant read.  While we are given the most minute details of the characters and their personal issues, this was couched in a stream of consciousness that was boring.  It clogged things up. There seemed no light at the end of the dark tunnel as life's greatest horror stories were revealed. Just too wordy and dense.

 

I was soundly disappointed.  Over the course of his career, I've been an avid reader and follower of Wally Lamb.  I feel this one falls short of his other writings.  It may be a melting pot of his life experiences, and perhaps his informative times with the women prisoners he's encountered.  I have no idea.  Maybe it was a story just too close for him to write about successfully.

 

In wrapping up, again, I found &quot;We Are Water&quot; a struggle to get through.  I finished it because it was a Wally Lamb book and I really wanted to push my way through it hoping it would get better.  Was the story worth it ultimately?  Not in my opinion.  Would it have been better in another format/writing style?  Perhaps.

 

I'm sad to say it was disappointing."
"Max (Maximum Ride, #5)",0316002895,James Patterson,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"I loved the Maximum Ride series through the third one. The writing style had changed a bit as the series went on but it wasn't enough to keep me away. When the fourth Maximum Ride book came out I was beyond disappointed and you may or may not understand why. I heard of the fifth one and simply frowned. My friend, that I got into the series, refused to read it unless I approved it for him (he shared my feelings about the fourth book). I'm four chapters into the fifth book and can already tell this is going to be better. The style is back to more like what Patterson was using in the second and third books. If you've been hesitant about picking this one up, I suggest you do, just to give the series another shot. I have a feeling taking the chance will pay off."

"Max (Maximum Ride, #5)",0316002895,James Patterson,Barnes and Noble,4.5,abby5595,"Maximum Ride the series started the flock being chased by scientists and erasers. Now the flock is helping people to get rid of global warming. MAX has thrill, adventure, and romance.

The flock takes another step to help rid the world of global warming. Max's mom gets kidnapped and is suspected to be in Hawaii. To save Max's mom the flock must go through Navy training. Fang and Max attempt to have some romantic moments but sometimes things don't happen the way the flock wants it. Not much time can be for romance when a new threat is made to the Earth is made in the form of Mr. Chu. 

The book to me was great. It wasn't as good as the first, but not as bad as the fourth. The surprises made me jump. The romance made me ""aww"". The action gave me adrenaline rushes. Patterson makes it so if you've never read the series you could still understand. In Maximum Ride I find it interesting that he is male and is writing in a female perspective. I still recommend you read the other books first. I personally thought the book was awesome it took me an hour and a half to read.

This book is geared to young adults but is great for anyone. Max has to save the world and try to balance a relationship. That's a lot on one bird kid's shoulder. The flock is always there to help her, and give her more problems. With Max's mom being kidnapped she might need some help from more than just the flock. MAX is a book that you start reading and can't stop."
"Halo (Halo, #1)",0312656262,Alexandra Adornetto,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Bonnie_W,"In a teen market overcrowded with dark, brooding supernatural novels, 
""Halo"" stands out as something different. If the bright, liquid-gold light beckoning from the cover doesn't pull your eyes away from the black, angsty covers surrounding it, its premise will surely grab the attention of the reader looking for something ""different."" The novel initially caught my attention due to the fact that even though it was dealing with the supernatural theme of angels currently being made popular by smash hits such as Becca Fitzpatrick's ""Hush, Hush"" and Lauren Kate's ""Fallen,"" the angels in ""Halo"" are still messengers of God.

The book revolves around Bethany, a young angel visiting Earth for the first time, her brother Gabriel, an Arch Angel, and sister Ivy, a seraphim. The three messengers have descended in human form in order to combat the forces of evil infiltrating mankind. It takes a lot of time for them to adjust to life as ""humans,"" especially Bethany, who is experiencing everything anew. She is more ""human"" than the other angels and is able to share their emotions, which leads her into trouble when she falls for a mortal boy at her new school.

""Halo"" is full of rich, vibrant detail that paints an image in the reader's mind. It's easy to envision the kind of world the angels came from and to see our own society through their eyes. The way Bethany viewed Earth felt very natural, like something an angel would think. Alexandra Adornetto masterfully wove words together to create such a cohesive point of view that never felt forced the way some other novels do.

Readers looking for a romantic focus with a lighter form of the supernatural thrown into the mix will find themselves intrigued by the latest novel to enter the teen market. It's different from anything out there and might very well pave the way for other such stories. It's also nice to see books coming out this fall where it is the female main character who is a supernatural being and that the male she winds up falling for is mortal and not necessarily a brooding bad boy, first with Sophie Jordan's ""Firelight"" and now with ""Halo."""
"Halo (Halo, #1)",0312656262,Alexandra Adornetto,Barnes and Noble,4.2,RaiderLadd1,"Alexandra Adornetto has a bright future ahead of her. For being only eighteen she writes with a good amount of maturity. I really enjoyed the first half of the book but thought that the later half was a bit predictable, even said I couldn't put it down. I recommend this book. :)"
"Halo (Halo, #1)",0312656262,Alexandra Adornetto,Barnes and Noble,4.2,mfelts,I ended up buying this as a spur of the moment kind of thing.  The synopsis of it was just so generic that it turned me off of the book but the back cover had a passage of the book that was captivating so I got it and I do not regret it! This book is touching and there is just something about it that shines a light on humanity that people can relate to. I hope there is another one coming out soon.
The Inheritance of Loss,0802142818,Kiran Desai,Barnes and Noble,3.3,Anonymous,"Was it not Orhan Pamuk that said that an author who has not experienced poverty should not attempt to write about it?  Kiran Desai has violated this maxim and her elitist attitude and class status are clearly evident. 

""The Inheritance of Loss"" is virtually an unreadable novel for several reasons. However, before I go into these, and another commenter calls me and other ""negative"" commenters ""rubes,"" I should state that I have been studying and reading literature for thirty years and am a civil rights attorney. 

Ms. Desai's novel fails in several areas: characterization, dialogue, grammar, sentence construction, flow of the prose, and moral obligation to the subjects.

Every character in this novel has the same voice and interior monologue. All the voices are juvenile at best and immature at worst despite the age of the character. (e.g., p. 3, during the judge's interior monologue, he thinks, ""Never ever was the tea . . ."" May I ask, which adult male uses the term ""Never ever"" verbally or in his own mind? Similarly, the cook thinks in his interior monologue on page 10.  ""They had guns now, which they might clean of rust, fill with bullets, and . . . shoot!"" A grown man with average intelligence would not think in such childlike terms.)

Further, you do not ""know"" the characters since each of them appear to be the same in tone, thoughts and personality.  Unlike, perhaps, the deep and vivid characters in  Jhumpa Lahiri's work, Desai's characters are flat, sterotypical and robotic. 

Ms. Desai's use of dialogue is unrealistic and stilted as well.  If you read her dialogue out loud with another person, you will realize that people do not talk in that manner. 

Grammatically, Ms. Desai's book is rife with a plethora of errors that read to a person like fingernails scratching down the literary blackboard of the soul. The novel reads like an exotic Sophie Kinsella novel.  She overuses adverbs and adjectives in a superfluous manner.  She uses the same word redundantly in the sentence.  (e.g., p. 8, the word ""hanging"" is used twice in one sentence.) Perhaps, she could make use of a thesaurus. Virtually on every page, she misuses dependent clauses such that actions occur simultaneously, which could not happen at the same time. There is a more creative way to design similes and metaphors than by always using the word ""as."" This writing distracts from the flow of a novel. 

The most egregious part of Ms. Desai's book is that it humiliates and debases people of poverty, people not of her socio-economic class and caste. She presents all the impoverished characters as though they were weak, powerless, unintelligent and prideless. Apparently, Ms. Desai has had very few negative and/or real life experiences and has lived in a privileged bubble as shown by her insensitivity in the text.  (e.g., page 6 when describing the cook: ""His lines had been honed over centuries, passed down through generations, for poor people needed certain lines; the script was always the same, and they had no option but to beg for mercy. The cook knew instinctively how to cry."" This is insulting and degrading. Also, on page 11, she writes ""He was a powerless man, barely enough learning to read and write, had worked like a donkey all his life....""  

Perhaps, she should listen to her dear friend Orhan Pamuk."
The Inheritance of Loss,0802142818,Kiran Desai,Barnes and Noble,3.3,Spoony,"I really wish I had read the reviews before buying this book.  I can't believed it received such acclaim.  The author clearly has style--her narration is chock-full of little spot-on anecdotes--but her character and plot development are nonexistent.  I have felt more connected to cartoon characters.  Maybe I just didn't get it, missed the point, but by the time I was halfway through, I hated the book so much that I didn't care anymore about the fact that it was over my head.  I will never again purchase a book based solely on its receipt of the National Book Critics Circle Award or the Man Booker Prize."

I am usually eager to read and find out what happens next, but picking up this book was painful each time and I decided to just give up.

"At Grave's End (Night Huntress, #3)",0061583073,Jeaniene Frost,Barnes and Noble,4.6,harstan,"Married at least in terms of vampire laws, half-breed Cat Crawfield and pure bloodsucker Bones are euphoric.  They were manipulated cleverly by her family keeping them apart for years.  Now they live together and Bones has joined the government agency run by her uncle hunting rogue vampires.Already the most successful team due to Cat¿s unique prowess, the addition of Bones makes the unit seemingly invincible.  However, the vampire world recently learned that Cat is the notorious Red Reaper making her a Scarlet letter type target to her enemy and that Bones is a traitor.  While struggling to stay alive from hunter-vamps especially one who loathes Bones for dumping her, they must prevent a war of magic from devastating the world.The latest Night Huntress urban fantasy (see HALFWAY TO THE GRAVE and ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE) series is a powerful entry as the overarching theme moves forward with increasing complexity; while also containing an action-packed story line and intensifying the lead couple¿s romantic relationship.  Now that Cat is outed, she wears a bulls-eye on her forehead as vampiric gunslingers know taking her down would make them into an over night superhero, not that Bones will sit idly allowing that to happen.  Sub-genre fans will fully enjoy Cat¿s saga, as Jeaniene Frost¿s tour of the world of the ¿Grave¿ is deep yet fun to follow.Harriet Klausner"
"At Grave's End (Night Huntress, #3)",0061583073,Jeaniene Frost,Barnes and Noble,4.6,kitkat3ny,"This was a really fun read.  Now that Cat and Bones are married you would think life would start slowing down¿¿.. Actually it seems like things are getting worse!  However bad it gets, Cat and Bones stick it out together.  This book didn¿t have a minute to spare.  It has action, sex, humor, emotional scenes and interesting creatures.  Cat¿s father makes a rather nasty appearance and almost succeeds in getting her killed.  Justine is very surprising in this one.  All in all I think this book was just about perfect.  I like how Cat and Bones (and now I can say the gang) keep evolving instead of rehashing the same old story.  I love the direction the book is taking and can¿t wait for the next installment, An Early Grave due out July 2009.  I highly recommend this book and the rest of the series."

We would get ourselves a cup of coffee and head out to our deck every morning during the summer with this delightful book in hand.  We were so engaged with ""Bobo"" and her entire family that we couldn't wait to get started each day.  When we finished the book, we were actually saddened that we wouldn't have another day in which to share this wonderful read.
We laughed till we cried as Alexandra Fuller told her delightful stories about her mother, her father, sister, and the others who lived with and helped this fascinating family.  We also cried when tragedy struck.  We felt as though we knew these people and shared in their sorrows as they faced them throughout their lives.  We truly loved this book and just wanted it to go on and on. Thank you, Alexandra Fuller, for giving us such a fond memory.  My only regret is that there isn't a sequel.

Alexandra is a fascinating woman whom I would love to meet and talk with. I have not read her other book... but someday it will make it into my very large pile! 

My criteria for what makes a ""good read"" are: hooks me in the first 10 pages, opens my eyes to a new point of view, teaches me something about another culture or part of the world, makes me want to learn more. This book hit them all hands down!"
Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight,0375758992,Alexandra Fuller,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"An amazing story that reveals the harsh realities of life for   the poor in several African countries during the 1970s.    Written as a memoir and dedicated to the author's    mother, this book would be appreciated by those   interested in African life, manic-depression, alcoholism,   poverty, farm life, race relations  or people who   enjoy stories with a wry, dark sense of humor. This book   is not written with the sense of balance or thoroughness   one might find in a textbook, but rather it is a collection   of stories that describe how one family coped with the   extreme poverty and the political upheaval of 1970s   Africa. By turns it is sad, desperate, intimate, bittersweet,   and funny as hell. It will surely evoke some strong   emotions in anyone who reads it."
Beauty: A Retelling of the Story of Beauty and the Beast,0064404773,Robin McKinley,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Withinu101,"My mother actually recommended this book to me when I was sixteen years old and I loved then and love it now.  This is not your typical meet the beautiful protagnist and then she meets ugly beast and in time she learns to love him.  This has a different twist to it!  Beauty is not at all physically beautiful, her two sisters in which shocking are kind, and loving sisters. Beauty is just ""plain jane"" and throughout the book she discovers her talents, wit, sense of humor, her own beauty and the love of her life.  
Great book, for young women who are looking on the inside for something.  Wonderful introduction of how to help others as well as discovering yourself!"

Beauty: A Retelling of the Story of Beauty and the Beast,0064404773,Robin McKinley,Barnes and Noble,4.5,clemmy,"I have never been a big fan of Disney's interpretation of things, and I found this book very refreshing in that Beauty and the Beast actually have a relationship and a reason to love one another. Beauty is very easily respected because she has reasons for all that she does. She loves to read, and she loves her horse Greatheart. This book is very well-written and enjoyable. It's a love story, but instead of ""oh, they fell in love and lived happily ever after,"" we as readers watch their love develop and grow. Beauty must learn about herself and the Beast's history as she gets used to living in an overly large castle infused with magic who wait at her beck and call (sometimes before) and some who help without Beauty wanting it. At the end, you are convinced that they are truly and perfectly in love."
Eating Animals,0316069906,Jonathan Safran Foer,Barnes and Noble,4.2,phishy73,"I already know I won't ever eat a chicken again.  Now, I'm working on getting eggs out of my diet as well.  Even if you think you've read and heard it all about how our factory farms operate, read this book anyway. You will learn something new.  I've been an on again, off again vegetarian, (like the author) and after I'm finished with this book, it will be very hard to be even a casual meat eater.  It may just turn me vegan!  I also love the fact that he takes both sides of the argument by including letters from the people that work at factory farms, but really, I don't believe feeding the world has to destroy it.  Americans eat too much meat, plain and simple.  That's why we have a lot more disease and obesity in this country than anywhere else in the world.  The Western diet is the most unhealthy, disease promoting diet on the planet, and yet people are so unwilling to change.  Find out the facts and do what feels right to you.  I think it's funny to live in a country where if you mention you don't eat meat, people get angry with you and wonder what your problem is.  Now I know those people just feel guilty or feel like I'm quietly criticizing them. 

We have to be conscious eaters or we will be unhealthy.  Mr. Foer has done loads of research and all we have to do is read this book.  Highly recommend this book!"
Eating Animals,0316069906,Jonathan Safran Foer,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Early17,I highly recommend this book for anyone. Even those who already think they are on the writers side will be moved. Hopefully this book will wake up others to the dire problem we are living in.
Eating Animals,0316069906,Jonathan Safran Foer,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Read247X,"I can't tell you how surprised i was that in the beginning Foer dedicates a whole chapter to the story of his childhood and his grandmother. I'm nearly done with the book, and i actually finding myself wishing it would be longer. What i like about it is that he mingles with the gritty facts a witty humor and pairs them against touching stories and truthful insights. He shows the story from all sides. He looks at the subject of eating animals as a verb (the action of our eating them) and as a adj+noun pair (the animals that we eat). And he asks the vital questions in non-confrontational ways. We can eat meat...but does that mean we should? He guides you through his mindset of how he became a vegetarian with facts. Its almost like you're sitting there with him as he tells the story. Uncovering the methods of factory farming is something most of us would rather not do. I have been a vegetarian for a little over 4 months now, and i'm more convinced than ever. Farming used to be an honorable thing. My grandparents did it in their backyards. But just the combination of the words ""factory"" and ""farming"" should be enough to show how the scales have been tipped. We are eating mutants, plain and simple. Turkeys can't even reproduce naturally. This book educates you without making you hate the people responsible. Foer interviews many, including ranchers and slaughterhouse managers. He shows the story from their side. He presents us with the question of, ""Is it possible to be a conscious omnivore?"" (To eat meat that was not factory farmed.) He goes on to say it IS possible, but extremely difficult. All in all, it is a novel much more complex than you would assume. Vegetarian or staunch carnivore, it should be read."

"The Girl of Fire and Thorns (Fire and Thorns, #1)",0062026488,Rae Carson,Barnes and Noble,4.2,jenababy13,"The Girl of Fire and Thorns is a unique book of secrets, courage, and betrayals. Elisa is a sixteen year old girl who needs to embrace her destiny if she wishes to help the people around her and even more survive.

On her sixteenth birthday Princess Elisa is set to be married to the gorgeous King Alejandro. What she doesn't know is that it is for her own safety as well as an aid to Alejandro's kingdom.  See, Elisa is the ""chosen one"". She bears the Godstone, and only one is chosen every century.  She doesn't know love or strength yet, but she must rise above herself in order to protect those close to her and reach her destiny.

I have to admit, unfortunately, I could not get into this one.  At first, I honestly was going to stop and add it to the list of ""could not finish"", but for some reason I kept reading. And, I'm actually glad I did. From part 2 on... the story did pick up for me. Elisa learns who she needs to be and you can see her mature throughout the story. Also from part 2 on, I started to enjoyed the characters we met much more. And I honestly felt extremely bad for Elisa towards the end... it seemed that every time she was ready to love, it was ripped away from her.

Just because I could not get into it, doesn't mean anything though. I am just one opinion in hundreds maybe thousands! There are still good things I saw about the book. I saw a main character grow into herself. I saw a strong girl deal with love and loss. The book is also extremely unique and writing is very well done. I am only one person expressing my opinion, so if you are interested in the book, pick it up and try it out for yourself! Unfortunately, it was just not for me. =/"
"The Girl of Fire and Thorns (Fire and Thorns, #1)",0062026488,Rae Carson,Barnes and Noble,4.2,purdypiedad,"THE GIRL OF FIRE AND THORNS is an outstanding debut novel from Rae Carson. It combines every element that makes a fantasy novel fun to read (humor, page-turning adventure, magic, romance, an epic journey, and tons of suspense) with completely original elements that make the reader fall in love with both the novel and its protagonist, Elisa. Elisa is a very unlikely hero who has been chosen for greatness. The character development is outstanding as Elisa learns to embrace who she is while conquering her personal struggles in order to save a country that isn't even her own. The book is full of unexpected plot twists, political intrigue, religious exploration and critique, fabulous world building, and themes pertinent to every young woman today. This is one of the best written novels I have ever read, and I cannot recommend it highly enough."
"Enclave (Razorland, #1)",0312650086,Ann Aguirre,Barnes and Noble,4.4,RomancingRakes,"All I can say is WOW! I received this book as a gift and thought I would start it in the evening. I took a peak and somehow lost the rest of my day. (In a good way) Thank you Ms. Ann Aguirre.

I haven't read a book set in a post apocalyptic society. Nor have I read YA books in a while.

What I liked about this book: 
1)Deuce. The book is in her POV. She a strong, fierce and loyal Huntress. She has always lived her life underground and trained to be a Huntress since she was a brat. After getting paired with Fade, an older boy and Hunter, she begins to question whether the Elders in the enclave are keeping things from them. She sticks up for her friend and gets exiled along with Fade. She has the will of a Huntress but the heart of a Breeder.
2)Fade. He comes to the enclave partly starved and slightly feral. He is an outsider so he is never accepted by the people of the enclave. He is mysterious,strong and thoughtful. He always has Deuce's back whether she likes it or not.
3)The subtle hints of a love triangle between Deuce, Fade and Stalker. What book is complete without a bit of a love triangle?
4)The Freaks. Can I say that these zombie-like things gave me nightmares? I can still hear the sound of teeth ripping into flesh. I can still see their claw-like hands, razor sharp teeth dripping with blood, and smell death on their breaths.
5)Movie-like description. As I was reading this book, I could almost see it like a movie playing in my head. (Are you listening Hollywood?)
6)The fight scenes with the Freaks and later the gangers. I haven't read a book that has given me this many short bursts of adrenaline or heart palpitations. Ever.

What I didn't like about this book:
1)It left me wanting more. As in, I can't wait for the next book."

Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time,0802714625,"Dava Sobel, Neil Armstrong",Barnes and Noble,3.8,BWasvick,"Longitude by Dava Sobel is the story of English clockmaker John Harrison who competed for a prize from the English government to discover an effective way to track longitude. He had no formal education but learned how to read from his father. His father taught him many trades, and with these trades and a love of reading, Harrison made a clock just by studying a textbook. Without being able to calculate longitude ships never really knew where they were or were going on long voyages, thus causing many wrecks and deaths of sailors. There was thought there might be a celestial solution. The problem with using the stars was that you had to be extremely skilled as an astronomer and have a great knowledge of the stars movement to figure location. With nobody being able to solve the longitude problem the British government set up a prize committee in 1714 called the Board of Longitude to help inventors financially so they could try and find a way to calculate longitude. Harrison finishes four sea clocks, each one better than the last, but the Board of Longitude will not award him the prize. The Board of Longitude favors astronomer Nevil Maskelyne and his lunar distance method theory, which attempts to use the moon to track longitude. He never gets the prize from the Board of Longitude who continued to use any means necessary to not allow him to win. Harrison's clock was finally recognized by King George III and Parliament who, despite the Board of Longitude putting him down, awarded Harrison with the money that was rightfully his. Clock making became a huge business after Harrison's success and the mass production of his sea clock became a priority. I'm not a big reader, to say the least, but honestly, I really enjoyed the read. These days it's just expected that our cruise ship or airplane will get to exactly where it's going. Honestly, I have never thought twice about it. I never realized what a big impact not being able to calculate longitude had on the sailing world. Ships would wreck all the time simply because they couldn't calculate where they were. The book had plot, and a good storyline, and a good climax, and a happy ending. I though I was reading fiction. You are drawn in by the main character's story and you feel for him in his struggle to win the prize, and all the obstacles he faces in creating his longitude clock and all of the people trying to set him up for failure. And finally in the end it all works out and you are happy for him. I really enjoyed Longitude. It's not at all the kind of book I expected. It's an entertaining story and wouldn't you know, I learned something too. Who would have thought learning could be fun, right? Seriously, if you have an interest in sailing, travel, history, or even just clocks then this is a book definitely worth checking out for a light read."

Faust: First Part,0553213482,"Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Peter Salm",Barnes and Noble,3.8,Anonymous,Warning--this is not the complete Faust as advertised. Only part one.
Faust: First Part,0553213482,"Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Peter Salm",Barnes and Noble,3.8,EA-Bucchianeri,"Goethe¿s ¿Faust¿ is arguably the most important milestone in Romantic literature.  Taking the famous medieval legend of Dr. Faustus and his pact with the devil, Goethe adapted the tale of old, and transformed it into a great love story, and a probing poetical tract on the nature of good and evil, salvation and damnation, failing and striving, the innate search for truth and lasting fulfilment.Part One (first published 1808) features Faust¿s disgust with his life and the world at large, and attempting to unite with the Spirit of creation and soar above the petty corporality of earth, the proud old scholar is dashed to the ground, for he must first work his salvation out on earth by the sweat of his brow before he can be admitted into the presence of the Deity.  In desperation, Faust tries to commit suicide, but then makes a wager with the devil: if Mephistopheles can show him that one moment of bliss he is searching for and succeeds in persuading him to cease all his human striving for that one moment, then his soul is forfeit.  The devil agrees to the wager, grants Faust the gift of youth, and the adventures begin.  He meets young Margareta and falls in love, a romance that leads to tragedy for the innocent maiden.David Luke¿s award-winning translation is one of the best I have read.  While the rhythms do jar on occasion, this does not take away from the `flow¿ of this rendition.  There will always be discrepancies when a text is taken out of its original language in any case, so it is more constructive to concentrate on the `readability¿, this translation succeeds in portraying the mood of Goethe¿s text and the personality of his vibrant characters.  In some instances, it may be argued the translation is too modern, for example, lines [2065-2070] when Mephistopheles prepares his magic flying cloak for their journey to a new life of youthful debauchery:Mephistopheles:¿One merely spreads one¿s cloak¿you¿ll findIt give us aerial elevation.Though, please, this bold step for mankind,Imposes luggage-limitation.I¿ll set the burners going, heat some air, and lo!We travel light, the earth lies far below.¿Did Neil Armstrong land on the moon in Goethe¿s time?  Of course not, but Luke¿s witty lines humorously displays Mephistopheles¿ rakish personality and has become one of my personal favourites in this English edition.The book features an informative introduction on Goethe¿s biography and the composition of Part One and includes a graph displaying how he edited and added to the scenes until he arrived at the text we know today.There is also a select bibliography, a general chronology of Goethe¿s life and career, and helpful explanatory endnotes for those who wish to study the details of the text more thoroughly.  For ¿Urfaust¿ scholars, Luke highlights the lines that were part of Goethe¿s early draft.E.A. Bucchianeri, author of ¿Faust: My Soul be Damned for the World¿"

Lies My Teacher Told Me,0684818868,James W. Loewen,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"As most of us know, the winners write the textbooks  and if you know much about the textbook industry, it is blatantly obvious that politics plays a huge role in what gets published.  There can be absolutely no doubt that this country has refused to acknowledge its own sins of the past, particularly where the Native American issue is concerned.    As a career educator and administrator in the public sector, I have witnessed (and unfortunately, been guilty of) teaching sketchy, often misleading, and sometimes completely false historical information to public school students.  We don't have a choice oftentimes, because to teach in opposition to the adopted textbook, or to even expand on it and give a more multi-faceted view, is controversial and could lead to the loss of a teaching job.  Again, politics raises its ugly head, at the expense of the truth.    So, Bravo! to Mr. Loewen for having the nerve to present an opposing viewpoint.  Those who have been completely indoctrinated into the current radical right wing mindset will have much difficulty with this book, because it would require a major paradigm shift for them.  And, as we know, the very term 'conservative' implies sameness, follower, unexcepting of differing views, etc.  A paradigm shift requires kicking over sacred cows, and re-evaluating belief systems  it requires casting a critical eye on why we believe what we believe.    If you are interested in the truth behind the myth of American History, READ THIS BOOK!"
Lies My Teacher Told Me,0684818868,James W. Loewen,Barnes and Noble,4,k8smomma,"Enlightning beyond belief. The belief that if we were told it in school by someone of authority, then it HAD to be true. BUT SO MUCH OF IT WASN'T! This book will set you straight on many aspects of our country's ""history"" as nothing else I've ever read. An important and necessary book for all people no matter what your race, social background or age. If it isn't required reading for high school students, then we can only hope that one day it will be. Not the fast-paced kind of read that fiction can provide but has facts so startling new and true, for many of us, that you will be amazed at what you find out."
Lies My Teacher Told Me,0684818868,James W. Loewen,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"The most brilliant book I've ever read on US history. This is US history as I learned it in Europe. Why do Europeans learn the truth and Americans don't? You have nothing to be ashamed of, not even of the truth. Yes, it is brutally honest, but the history of every country is full of extremely brutal things. We can't make anything better in the future if we aren't aware of our past. In order to be proud of our heritage, it is absolutely necessary to also know the negative things our native country did. No country on this planet only did good things, that's just not human nature. You can be proud of your country anyway. So this is an absolute must read book, not only for Americans."

The story is jam packed with suspense and the characters are instantly relatable and lovable, or terrifying.

"Locke & Key, Vol. 1: Welcome to Lovecraft",1600102379,"Joe Hill, Gabriel Rodríguez",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Raspy,"This graphic novel works on so many levels. The characters are deep enough for just about any teen to relate to. After the tragic events that kick off this story, you begin to feel for these characters. It adds flash backs to flesh out the drama and how much this event relates to these three young adults. Once the element of the supernatural is made clear you will not be able to put down this book. A page turner to the very end, that also leaves open room for a sequel that can stick with the idea of opening new doors. I plan on reading the next graphic novel soon and hope to see many sequels published in the near future."

This first volume sets up the series.
The artwork is packed with telling detail. I found myself re-reading pages to savour the little touches in every panel. 
A lot of successful comic writing comes down to pacing and compression. The writer is a master at leading you through the story. The telling of the tale is clever and inventive.
The partnership of the creative team is something you'll admire. 
Also, the book itself is gorgeosuly bound and printed. This is the whole package.

Scarlett,0446363251,Alexandra Ripley,Barnes and Noble,3.8,historicalfictionsac,"After reading Gone with the Wind, I was curious about Scarlett. I was a little leary about it though,seeing that it was a sequel written by another author. But it picked up right where Gone with the Wind left off and I was immediately swept up into it, I could hardly put it down. I absolutely and highly recommend it!"
Scarlett,0446363251,Alexandra Ripley,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Anonymous,"Gone With the Wind, one of the greatest books ever, leaves us hanging. What happens to Rhett and Scarlett? Although not quite the same as Margaret Mitchell's book, I absolutely loved Scarlett. We are sent on so many new adventures with Scarlett as she first tries to make Rhett love her again, and we are introduced to Scarlett's family in Ireland as she makes a new start for herself and her daughter, Cat. This book had me on the edge of my seat, waiting to see what would happen and wondering ""is there any hope left for Rhett and Scarlett""? A wonderful conclusion to Margaret Mitchell's classic and a must-read for any true GWTW lover!"
Scarlett,0446363251,Alexandra Ripley,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Guest,"I approached this book with a mixture of fascination and caution. A sequel to a beloved novel, written many years later by a different author, can be downright dangerous to one's memory of the original. The proof is always in the reading, though  and in this case, the estate of Margaret Mitchell made a resoundingly fine call in choosing Alexandra Ripley to write the sequel to Gone With the Wind. I hated finishing this one, because I didn't want to leave the characters and their world after reading its final paragraph.    Ripley's Scarlett O'Hara is true to the character Mitchell created, but she does what the original Scarlett didn't have time (even in Gone With the Wind's vast scope) to do. She grows up. The selfish girl who never did learn the meaning of love does that at last, in the course of a multidecade journey that takes her from Atlanta back to Tara - to Charleston, the home of her estranged husband, Rhett Butler - to Savannah, where her mismatched parents married and their families still live - and on to Ireland's County Meath. Author Ripley understands what makes a woman like Scarlett tick, and leads her (sometimes gently, sometimes not!) through a journey of self-discovery that plays out against colorful real-world events.    I'm no fan of bodice-ripping romances, but this isn't one. It's historical fiction with a strong woman at its center. My only criticism is an annoying tendency on Ripley's part to put suspiciously modern-sounding dialog into her characters' mouths. In every other respect, this sequel strikes all the right notes."

Escape from Camp 14: One Man's Remarkable Odyssey from North Korea to Freedom in the West,0670023329,Blaine Harden,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"Amazing, profoundly moving book.  This is the story of a North Korean who somehow escaped the prisons of his country to escape to the United States, but not without having a role in the tragic deaths of many members of his family.  It depicts the brutal atrocities of a tyrannical regime, and leaves the reader profoundly affected by his story.  How would we behave if put into the same situation?  It made me look at Kim Jong Il, his father, and the government of North Korea in a way I've never imagined before.
There have been some great books by Korean authors recently, which I would also highly recommend.
&quot;Please Look After Mom&quot; is a poignant tale of a Korean mother who goes missing, and her family's attempts to locate her.  It's told from four points of view.
&quot;In Stitches&quot; is the memoir of a second generation Korean American who was raised by a tyrannical Korean immigrant father, and how he overcame his childhood to become a doctor.  A fast, funny, and heartwarming read.  I highly recommend on three of these books!"

Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien, Alan Lee",Barnes and Noble,4.1,StefanY on LibraryThing,"The Children of Hurin provides some great historical material to Tolkien's world of Middle-Earth and adds even more richness to the Lord of the Rings. This addition to Tolkien's extensive historical background of Middle-earth fills in the gaps and fleshes out stories that have been mentioned and hinted at in other works by giving us a detailed and colorful look at the tragic story surrounding Túrin and Niënor (Hurin's children) and the ongoing battle against Morgoth, the master of the Lord of the Rings' evil character, Sauron.This is a well-told tale with engaging characters and plenty of action that keeps the reader interested throughout. While not as enthralling as the Lord of the RIngs Trilogy, or as entertaining and wonderful as The Hobbit, The Children of Hurin is a worthy addition to the Middle-Earth cannon and is a more complete novel than most other source material that is out there. It stand on it's own well and one does not need to have read any of the other histories to follow along with what is going on here.Overall, a solid work that I'd recommend to fans of Tolkien's works or epic fantasy in general."

Light in August,0679732268,William Faulkner,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"My first time reading a Faulkner novel but it will not be the last.  This book is just so wonderful.  Lots of symbolism.  I would say this book is not for the impatient reader, but it makes you realize how some author's 
are really light weights.  I would most surely recommend this for book discussions.  I really enjoyed being in the old South!"
Light in August,0679732268,William Faulkner,Barnes and Noble,4.2,kambrogi on LibraryThing,"If you want to explore the growth of the literary arts in the 20th century, then read William Faulkner.  What Shakespeare was to his age, Dostoevsky was to his, Faulkner was to his own.  He reshaped what it meant to create literary fiction, in a way both clear and dense, both mundane and biblical, and all the while startlingly beautiful.  He gave a new set of tools to writers who wanted to explore the human condition.  Others may point to James Joyce or T S Eliot, but it was Faulkner who took their inspirations and gave them humanity, made words live and breathe, made words that could thrill and break your heart.  But make it larger in the process.At the center of Light in August is a man called Joe Christmas who is lost between worlds in the American post-Civil War South.  Although he belongs to no community, he is judged by them all, and invariably found wanting.  Christmas commits a brutal crime that grows out of a curse visited upon him by his ancestors and their history.  But Christmas is not alone in his struggle.  Other lost souls include a young country girl searching for the man who fathered her child, a minister who is trapped in a loop of family history, a laborer who longs for love and music and Christian goodness, several born-again Christians intent on brutalizing those who fail in the eyes of their God, and several other fascinating misfits searching for peace in a world intent on denying it to them.  To a great extent it¿s a book about fathers and sons, with fathers as great as God and as lowly as deadbeat dads playing their parts in a journey toward a tragic but not entirely hopeless end.  The book is complex, twisting, multilayered and brilliant, rich with humor, wisdom, tragedy, death and resurrection.  It isn¿t an easy read, but it is beautiful, powerful and true.  It reminded me of what great literature is, and why I love to read it."
Light in August,0679732268,William Faulkner,Barnes and Noble,4.2,jamguest on LibraryThing,"By far, the best I can remember reading. All the reasons I love the storytelling aspects of Faulkner: his characters, long winding, grammatically unhindered passages, darkness and light. There are numerous theological implications that fill the novel, though I missed them because I was so utterly engrossed in the characters. It is worth another re-read and a lengthier extrapolation of its themes. Though it seemed long (@ 500  pages it almost is) and I mistakenly lost sight of the goodness of the story by the end ¿ rushing through it a little too fast as I was anxious to finish and begin my next novel. But that¿s on me; that¿s my fault and my weakness; this book had none. It is sheer brilliance. Lena Grove is a fascinating character, as is her Light in August. Bunch is annoying and sad. Hightower is admirable if heavily faulted and seemingly arrogant and frustrating because he possess the most opportunity to do good in this novel. Birch is just an imbecile and vagabond with no badness or goodness to mention. Christmas is unfortunate and sad, though I root for his salvation as a character."
The Trumpet of the Swan,0064408671,"E.B. White, Fred Marcellino",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"The Trumpet of the Swan is a children&rsquo;s novel written by E.B White. This book is a folk-tale story about a swan learning how to believe in himself. Sam, a young boy, shows sympathy for a helpless swan that can&rsquo;t get his voice. The swan&rsquo;s name is Louis and his father doesn&rsquo;t like an imperfect family, but he believes that his son may be able to get his voice. Will Louis ever find his voice?




Sam Beaver is an eleven year old boy that has black hair and brown eyes like an Indian. Sam also walks like an Indian too, and really likes to visit wild places. Sam finds a Trumpeter Swan at the pond and he has never seen anything like that in his life. In chapter four, the cygnets hatch from the eggs and say hi to Sam, but one of them pulls Sam's shoe laces. The male cob is excited that he is a father now. On page 42, the mother swan gets the father's attention due to Louis's lack of voice. She says &ldquo;Have you noticed anything different about Louis?&rdquo; The father swan suffers from anxiety because has an imperfect son. 




Louis thinks about his communication problem and thinks of his own answer. He will learn how to read and write. He carries a slate and chalk and is able to talk to anyone who can read. Louis spends the night at the Ritz. When the Boatman takes Louis to the Ritz, the clerk has a hard time accepting the swan as a guest. Louis does not like his job. On page 179, Louis says &ldquo;This job is a waste of my time; I could be playing my trumpet right now.&rdquo; The swans like to go to sleep when the sun goes down, but musicians seem to wake up a sundown and play most of the night. Louis does not enjoy the noise and chaos of the club.




Louis and Serena come home to the Red Rock Lakes. The old cob receives a letter saying that he has to pay four million dollars to pay for the trumpet damage. Meanwhile, Serena and Louis plan out their life together. The Greening Spring is the finale. Louis and Serena are all set for a wonderful life. 




The author uses the literary device onomatopoeia by throwing in the word &ldquo;Ko-hoh, ko-hoh!&rdquo; The author was describing how the trumpets sound high above in the air. On page 167, the author uses the literary device rhythm and rhyme. He uses this literary device by putting in the lyrics of a song Serena was singing. The song says &ldquo;Lul- la- by and good night, with-ros-es-be- dight&rdquo;. This was in her performance before Louis came and surprised her.




The theme of the book took place in chapter five. Louis knows he&rsquo;s nothing like his siblings, who have a voice. He tries to fit in and become like the regular kids, but he can&rsquo;t. On page 46, the father swan says &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s really true that Louis has no voice, then I shall provide him with a device of some sort, to enable him to make a lot of noise.&rdquo; He is showing that he cares about his son and will do anything for him. The theme of this book is family is the most important thing because his mother and father are concerned about their children and want to help Louis all that they can.




I would give this book four stars because it&rsquo;s a great book where lessons can be taught and learned and I would recommend it to anyone.

Tenth of December,0812993802,George Saunders,Barnes and Noble,3.4,Anonymous,"I've never felt more compelled to write a book review.  I was so disappointed with this book...the stories are strange, they don't have a good flow, and I found myself wanting to skip pages, hoping it would get better along the way.  No such luck.  I have always found it easy to immerse myself in a book, but this took some real effort, and I still couldn't manage to stay interested in the weird, twisted stories with unsatisfying endings.  What a waste of time and money."

"Night Pleasures (Dark-Hunter, #1)",0312593554,Sherrilyn Kenyon,Barnes and Noble,4.3,MM1019,"I don't think B&N has their series numbers labeled correctly.  I went to numerous other websites to get the listings for the Dark-Hunter series.  There are atleast 13 books, so I wanted to make sure I had an accurate list so I could read the books in order.  B&N says Night Pleasures is the first in the series.  All the other sites say it is ""Fantasy Lover"".  B&N does has this book, but it is not numbered at all.  I had a hard time reading Night Pleasures, and now I see why.  I should have read the other book first. Very frustrating, seeing as how I'm already on the third book."
"Night Pleasures (Dark-Hunter, #1)",0312593554,Sherrilyn Kenyon,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"Basically I own the whole entire series in paperback and I am looking foward to the rerelease in hardcove, which looks amazing. If you are not familiar with the dark hunters now is a good time to start. Sherrilyn Kenyon is honestly my favorite author of all time and out of the dark hunter series Night Pleasures is probably my favorite because it is the book that started it all. Just keep in mind if you are interested in the dark hunter saga there is a prequel called Fantasy Lover that you might want to read before you read this one. But even if you don't read Fantasy Lover you will still be okay because Night pleasures fills in the gaps. But if you are on the fence about Night Pleasures you will not be disappointed if you get it in fact if you don't get it you will be missing out. Honestly I reccomend Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark Hunter series to anyone and everyone. Sure It is labeled Romance, but it is so much more than that it's like a whole entire world that you can fall in love with. So basically overall buy Night Pleasures for your library you will be glad you did. Especially since this book introduces you to characters you will love, Kyrian and Amanda, and it also introduces you to an amazing concept that is laced with greek mythology which makes it even better."

The word ""wife"" was replaced with ""with"". Many punctuation marks were missing. Odd capital letters and even sometimes numbers showed up in the middle of words. Very distracting when you are trying to decipher what it is supposed to say. I really thought something was wrong with my nook until I read the other reviews. It would really be great if the publisher would send out a corrected version."

While I found it interesting   that the author wrote about my own conclusions after casually observing people  and wondering 'how they did it', I was still disappointed in that I found no 'secrets' and no 'surprises'.  I found it more interesing from the viewpoint of marketing such common sense information."

It shows that everyone can save and work hard to become a millionaire. What we see on TV, the celebrities are just a small fraction and are kind of like the atypical millionaires; they don't represent the majority of the rich in terms of lifestyle and attitude. This book shows how living below your means, with the goal of financial independence in mind, can get you to millionaire status. What's said is a good reality check to reorient yourself to achieving your ultimate goal. Quite humbling."

"Chronicles, Vol. 1",0743244583,Bob Dylan,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"Bob Dylan is known as a spiritual man, but also a loner, often offering opaque answers (or none at all) to direct questions. True to form, in Chronicles I there are many biographical omissions, and we are not given any real insights into his spiritual beliefs. However, what this autobiography does offer is a very engaging look at one man¿s evolution with his own creative voice, both in light of, and in spite of, the public attention it has received. It is on this level that Chronicles I interested and challenged me.   Unlike Bob Dylan¿s previous book, 1966¿s Tarantula, which was a psychedelic roll through his subconscious, Chronicles I features an introspective Dylan writing plainly and openly about his creative process. For a famous recluse Dylan is remarkably exposed  however, many of the elements that defined Dylan¿s musical path are dealt with only in passing¿sometimes in a single sentence. In fact, in some cases the moments that made Bob Dylan into Bob Dylan are ignored completely. Counter to what many music critics and fans may have wanted or expected, we are not offered an autobiography that is a full, wide-screen disclosure. What we are given is an invitation into the creative process of one of popular music¿s most significant icons.   We are given snapshots of the formation of the man at different stages of his career: the young man striving for success  the successful man striving for authenticity  the older man striving for inspiration. The book is an account of process, perseverance and passion, and we see Dylan struggling to form and understand the voice that he feels is uniquely his, recognized now as one of the most significant in pop culture in the last fifty-odd years.   To me, Chronicles I is at its best when it is showing the Dylan of the early 1960s, when he first arrived in New York City. Virtually alone in an unfamiliar city, Dylan began playing shows in folk clubs around Greenwich Village. We are told of how he forged his identity on hard-scrabble folk music and emulated the parts of other artists that he admired, in a slow opening of his creative scope and a honing of an authentic voice of his own. Collectors of rare folk albums provided source material that became Dylan¿s foundation, and with a few specific musicians providing artistic epiphanies, Dylan¿s unusual vision took over.   Dylan¿s writing is a cadence of shortened sentences and clipped asides, and often reflects a wry humour that surprised me. But most impressive about Dylan¿s prose style was how similar it is in tone to his music. Chonicles I displays the same combination of simple words and sentence structures, mixed with vivid and unusual metaphors that are characteristic of Dylan¿s lyrics. Open the book to nearly any page and read for a paragraph or two and a voice you already know is reading to you. These lyrical skills have inspired a whole raft of pale imitators in a variety of genres, but are best used in the practised hands of an old pro.   I was also struck by Dylan¿s admission that he notices details more than narrative, a trait that informs his music and his writing. When I think of any significant Dylan song, it is the frayed snippets of sepia-toned characters that emerge. There are vagabonds, dilettantes and debutantes in his songs, and so too, in his recounting of his life, where he tells stories about the people and the times that were forming around him. As one of the most heralded and most revered musicians in modern times, it is revealing to see the processes of the man behind the myth."
"Chronicles, Vol. 1",0743244583,Bob Dylan,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"I had never been a Dylan fan, knew only what any 40-something American knows of his public life, and the only song I ever listened to carefully enough to enjoy it was *Tangled Up In Blue*. Attracted by nothing but curiosity and the luscious noirish cover, I bought this and read it. Okay, yes, I'll make a fool of myself here---just about every word did indeed glow like burning coals. I was entirely unprepared for the rich rich ride this book provides. The untethered chronology is wonderful precisely because the voice is so present, so immediate in every epoch it offers--we are always living a *now* with this voice. I had to read it with a highlighter because by the 3rd page I found there was no way I'd be able to memorize the passages whose loveliness/ingenuity/wit/feeling burned like, well, you know.  So engrossed was I in this book, that it wasn't till about page 50 that it occurred to me: Oh, wait a minute--is this why people are Bob Dylan fans???  And now, a mere two weeks after reading Chronicles, I find that I want to restrategize my longterm life plans to maximize the number of times I can listen to Bob Dylan's 115th Dream, or Fixing to Die, or Gates of Eden, or Shelter from the Storm, or Lonesome Day Blues..okay you get the picture.  I hope ardently that other people will open the Dylan door through this book--it's an amazing experience."
"Chronicles, Vol. 1",0743244583,Bob Dylan,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"I was very impressed with this book. I have always been a huge fan of Dylan's and was very familiar with his work.It could be a little dry to some depending on your taste in writting and music of coarse. What makes this book so great to me is that he is very percise on small details. He does not leave anyting out about the moves he makes. You get a thourough understanding of all the things he does once he hits New York. From the people he meets, to the books he read, to the shows he plays, you get a little bit of everything. I would recommend this to anyone interested in music or poetry."
The Lost Continent: Travels in Small Town America,0060920084,Bill Bryson,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,"It's amusing to me that so many readers have enjoyed Bryson's humor at the expense of other nations, and yet are quite indignant when he turns his attention to the U.S.  His observations are no more or less true here than they were in other books.      The U.S. has much to recommend it,  but it also has it's share of flaws and foibles which Bryson points out using his trademark wit and tongue-in-cheek criticism."
The Lost Continent: Travels in Small Town America,0060920084,Bill Bryson,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,"Not only was this book mean spirited, as has bee noted already, I have issues as to whether Bryson had even been in most of these places.  I have lived in Iowa, Illinois, Nevada, Mississippi, and Louisiana.  Places such as Mount Pleasant and Keokuk, Iowa, were grossly misrepresented by Bryson.  Carbondale, Illinois, is not just a strip of hotels and fast food as he says.  He doen't seem to grasp the highway concept.  The town does not resat on the highway, those are just facilities for the people who do wish to go into town.  It is a college town for God's sake, you think he woul have found that out.  Worst of all, the road he travels between Columbus and Tupelo, Mississippi, which he describes as being covered with run down shacks with black people sitting on the porch is false.  I have driven that road many times in my life, from the time before he wrote this book to last week, and it just isn't there.  Nobody lives on that road or has in my lifetime.  It is tree lined and nice and enjoyable.  There are many other gross minrepresentations and out and out lies in this book. Bryson is obviously just pandering to what people expect out of these places instead of actually going there and reporting the truth himself."
The Lost Continent: Travels in Small Town America,0060920084,Bill Bryson,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,"Gee whiz. I was really enjoying this book, and couldn't wait to get back to the last two chapters.Then I read the customer reviews here, and I was wondering if I missed something. I thoroughly enjoyed it and did not want it to end.  Granted, Bill is a bit of a Curmudgeon, but, he has a good sense of humor. Take a good look around you next time you travel, and I believe you will agree with his description of most tourists.   This is the third Bryson I have read, and I can't wait to read another."
Dreams of Joy (Shanghai Girls #2),140006712X,Lisa See,Barnes and Noble,4.1,BabsBonMots,"Goodreads, you are spoiling me for anything other than reading! I had no intentions of whiling away the day by reading a book, but I received my recent win, ""Dreams of Joy"" on Thursday, started reading Saturday morning and couldn't stop. I have read Lisa See's other books (""Snowflower and the Secret Fan"", ""Peony in Love"", ""Shanghi Girls"") so was very pleased to score this win. ""Dreams of Joy"" is a continuation of the ""Shanghi Girls"" story--in some ways I wish I had re-read ""Shanghi Girls"" before I started ""Dreams of Joy"", just so that I could refresh the characters in my head.

""Dreams"" is the story of Joy, Pearl's daughter. (This is hard, I don't want to spoil the story by sharing too much.) Basically, Joy finds out some family secrets and leaves her home (America) and goes to China, where she buys into the communist philosophy. Along the way she loses her naivety, falls in love, meets her father, learns that she is a strong person, as well as to appreciate her family. Basically she grows up.

Meanwhile her mom (Pearl) follows her to China and learns some things about her ownself, her relationship with her sister, as well as her daughter.

Really liked this book. As in See's other books, you will learn about Chinese culture and history. In this book, there are several characters with bound feet. With the onset of communism, women were discouraged from this practice. In fact, those who had bound feet were encouraged to unbind them, which turns out to be a painstaking process with less than ideal results. Although the feet will unfurl, they cannot be ""normal"" since the bones were broken in the binding process when they were young. In the afterward the author mentions the photos of Joseph Rupp and his bound feet project. It was interesting to read the stories of these women, who just accepted this rite of passage as necessary to getting a husband, as well as to see their photos. I'd post the website for you to check out, but this site doesn't allow - so, do a search for Rupp Bound Feet Project if you'd like to learn more.

Highly recommend this book!"
Dreams of Joy (Shanghai Girls #2),140006712X,Lisa See,Barnes and Noble,4.1,theReader278,I loved reading this wonderful book! Excellent for a hot summer day!
Dreams of Joy (Shanghai Girls #2),140006712X,Lisa See,Barnes and Noble,4.1,-JACKI-,"DREAMS OF JOY begins where SHANGHAI GIRLS left off, right after Joy, (19 years old), finds out that May gave birth to her. After the fight, Joy, a student at the University of Chicago, decides to leave her university education behind and move to China. Soon after arriving in Shanghai, Joy finds her biological father, a well-known artist, who after the shock that he'd fathered a child with May.

The author does a wonderful job placing this intriguing family saga in the middle of Mao's ""New China"" with a balance of bringing the atrocities to light without over powering the family storyline. There is a great lesson in human nature that love, loyalty and perseverance can triumph and survive world unrest. Stunning realism and completely believable characters make this book a hit!"

The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable,0787960756,Patrick Lencioni,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Lencioni_Fan,"Emotional Intelligence 2.0 is a book I enjoyed which Pat Lencioni wrote the foreword for. I found Lencioni's foreword intriguing (apparently I was the one person who hadn't heard of him). So, I decided to check The Five Dysfunctions out, and am so glad that I did. 

This book explores the fundamental causes of organizational politics and team failure. Lencioni does an outstanding job showing a team that's going through some typical, real-world sticking points, yet is able to maneuver through them successfully. The central premise is that any team can work together effectively once they understand and overcome the five dysfunctions. 

The Five Dysfunctions are: 

* Absence of Trust, 
* Fear of Conflict, 
* Lack of Commitment, 
* Avoidance of Accountability, and 
* Inattention to Results 

I'm now using The Five Dysfunctions with my work group with great success. They were already reading the EI 2.0 book, and didn't skip a beat when I threw this one into the mix. Highly recommended."
The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable,0787960756,Patrick Lencioni,Barnes and Noble,4.1,M_L_Gooch_SPHR,"As a corporate human resources director, I am continually searching for material that will enhance our organizations team skills. Somewhat like another management book that I recommended Our Iceberg Is Melting: Changing and Succeeding Under Any Conditions, the author uses fictional tales to deliver truthful insights into our business practices. I found the book to be a very intertaining and fun read along with a ton of valuable information. The concepts within the book can be easily implemented and will result in continual improvement in your team building endeavors. The value of teamwork within the modern corporate structure is sometimes a hard sell in the real world. Managers need reference material and books that contain much needed advice if they are going to `prove' the value of teamwork to the CEO. Like communication, everyone says it is important but the rubber rarely meets the road. The part of the book that details the ""five dysfunctions"" is a great reference guide and also a topic that sounds eerily familiar as all seasoned managers have been down that road. The `five' are: 1. Absence of trust, 2. Fear of conflict 3. Lack of commitment 4. Avoidance of accountability 5. Inattention to results. I recommend this book because I believe it will be a  valuable addition to your bookshelf and certainly one that will be referenced again and again through the years. Michael L. Gooch, SPHR"
The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable,0787960756,Patrick Lencioni,Barnes and Noble,4.1,DianeTHeel,"My colleagues and I have been struggling with changes in leadership in the workplace.  A dear friend recommended this book as a resource, so I went out and bought it that day (and a second copy for one of my work colleagues).  The majority of the book focuses on the 'fable' of the team who has acquired a new leader.  The remainder of the book is an easily read discussion of the 5 dysfunctions, how they impact the overall team/work of the group, and strategies for changing to a more effective approach.  We're getting ready to use the book in some support sessions from our HR department.  And my husband can't wait to read it next (I already lent it to someone else).  Overall, an easy and entertaining read that has some real 'meat' in it -- reading it has given me the opportunity to identify some behaviors in myself that I'll be working to improve."
Junky,0142003166,"William S. Burroughs, Oliver  Harris, Allen Ginsberg",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"Wonderfully written. One gets the feel that the narrator is truly an addict. I found most intriguing that which was purposefully NOT written in this book. This man's life IS his addiction. Other events, which for most people are major milestones or reasons for celebration, are merely glossed over -  barely mentioned. To the discerning reader, it even greater emphasizes that this man's life, love, dedication, drive, and passions are soley committed to that of heroin. Its ending just seels this masterpiece."
Junky,0142003166,"William S.

Junky,0142003166,"William S. Burroughs, Oliver  Harris, Allen Ginsberg",Barnes and Noble,4.3,stephmo on LibraryThing,"In this slender volume, Burroughs manages what so many others come short of doing in so much more space and with far less success.  He traces the lifecycle of the Junky - from birth to existence and how one manages to slide into the lifestyle without seeming to notice.  The book covers Bill Gains life as he first tries morphine from a friend's batch of stolen goods all the way through as a full-blown addict hiding out in Mexico avoiding more stringent laws in the United States where he's spent time in and out of various rehabs, jails and going over countless other drugs, ways to kick and looking for that next elusive high.  In between are the crimes, the broken friendships, the failed relationships, the self-loathing homosexual hookups and a life of constant paranoia.  But there's also the release that Junk brings.  There's the joy of the score and the feeling in the back of ones knees and the ability to have all of that go away.Junky doesn't glamorize or demonize.  It's more of a front-line account of how one gets from point A to point B.  If one wants a morality tale, it's not coming.  Make no mistake, there's no false advertising from Bill when he says, ""I have learned the junk equation.  Junk is not, like alcohol or weed, a means to increased enjoyment of life.  Junk is not a kick.  It is a way of life."""
Getting to Yes: Negotiating an Agreement Without Giving In,0140157352,"Roger Fisher, William Ury, Bruce Patton",Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,"I was recommended this book by a management consultant. Having read it I understand why, like most consultants it has little new to say, plenty of buzz words but no real execution guidelines. The book is not all bad, I liked the explanation for the win-win attitude. Over all the book does explain the attitude you should have to renegotiate successfully, but unlike some great managerial books, lack the real world examples and guild lines on how to get the job done."

If you read this book and follow the advice, you will never look at an issue the same again. You will consider the interests of all parties prior to responding to any question. As a mediator, the tools are critical to a ""win-win"" outcome. I consider this book and their follow-up book, ""Beyond Reason"", as books to keep within arms reach at all times."
Getting to Yes: Negotiating an Agreement Without Giving In,0140157352,"Roger Fisher, William Ury, Bruce Patton",Barnes and Noble,3.7,Panchito,"Getting to Yes is a book that it is simple to read yet it is full of recommendations on how to negotiate and get to yes - thus getting what you want. Although the concepts outlined on this book should be known by everyone, it is not until you read it that it dings on you on the steps you need to take to prepare for any negotiation. When you get to the middle of the book, you already know all the concepts, and the rest of the book is more of a mantra of what was said initially. This is a book that can be read during the weekend. The challenge is practicing the concepts on real life situations."

The Song of Achilles,1408816032,Madeline Miller,Barnes and Noble,4.2,dearreaderCT,"This was a wonderful book.. It was impossible to put down.
Homer's epic is vividly retold, full of drama, gods and men, triumph and in the
end pity and tragedy.
  For anyone interested in the Classics this is essential reading.
  It is one of the finest novels I have ever read."
The Song of Achilles,1408816032,Madeline Miller,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Sain,"To simply put, it is a great book for a fan of Greek mythology. A nice retelling of the Iliad. 
Rarely do I re-read books or chapters within books, but this novel is an exception."
The Song of Achilles,1408816032,Madeline Miller,Barnes and Noble,4.2,LeahPetersen,"If I could give this an extra star past &quot;I love it!&quot; I would, because it accomplished something that I hardly ever find. It made me cry. Sobbed through the last five pages, could barely see to read the words.

It's even more amazing to me that I cried at the ending of a story that I &quot;knew&quot; the ending of before I started it. But even if you know the Iliad, you don't really know this ending, because this book wasn't about the long war, or the heroes who fought in it, or the trials and adventures they faced. This book was about Achilles and Patroclus. Yes, all of the above served as the supporting cast and framework in which their story took place, but this is a love story.

On top of that, it's told by the character we never really knew, Patroclus. His view of the war and how it plays out is nothing like those who fought in it for glory or honor or to serve the gods' ends. You get to see the human side of the story.

And it's amazingly done. I've seen some say it's slow, and as an action-filled story of a great war and the acts of great heroes, sure, it would be. That's not the kind of book it is, though, and as a love story it is paced beautifully. The author's ability to evoke setting and atmosphere and pure, mercilessly intense emotion is the wonder of this book.

I will admit, the seemingly random flipping back and forth from present tense to past tense for no reason I could ever figure out, was a distraction, but aside from making me pause and adjust from time to time, it was nothing compared to the power of the story.

Yes, you know what's going to happen and how it's going to end.

But you have no idea."

The Bhagavad Gita,0140449183,"Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa, Simon Brodbeck, Juan Mascaró",Barnes and Noble,4.7,MayaKB,"I have half a dozen translations of the Bhagavad Gita, but this is the finest, in my opinion. The language is at once clear and lyrical. What I especially appreciate is that Mascaro did not try to ""dumb down"" such terms as atman and karma by rendering them in English ""equivalents"" (""over-soul"" or ""wheel of life"") that are not equivalent at all.

The organization of the work is also beneficial since I have frequent occasion to quote from the scripture. In short, Mascaro treats the Gita as a work of scripture and spiritual education rather than an abstract piece of poetry that Western minds are not expected to understand.

I only wish it were available in Nook format. I've worn out two paperbacks already."

The New York Trilogy,0143039830,"Paul Auster, Art Spiegelman",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"I read this based on both the blurbs and the reviews.  I should have known better.  I wonder if I read the same book as the others who have raved about this -- the 'twists' and turns were obvious, the characters were completely disposible and mostly irrelevant -- none had any depth.      The stories -- each had potential, but it seemed as though he got tired halfway through and then gave it an obvious escape clause and typed 'the end.'      None of these stories gave me much pause about the nature of identity, the sense of self, etc that others claim -- that may mean that I'm too dense to see the questions, or the questions presented here were the one's that occurred to me when I was 16 and had a bong attached to my face...    The last story was the best of the lot, but it too collapsed at the finish line.  Too bad.      Overall, the stories were well concieved, poorly written, sparsely populated with thin characters about whom we care little, and ultimately trite.    If you want a thriller that posses good questions about identity, reality, and sense of self, try Crime and Punishment, by Doestoyevski.  That is a great story."
The New York Trilogy,0143039830,"Paul Auster, Art Spiegelman",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"I originaly heard about the series from a radiolab series. It sounded interesting so I decide to check it out. I read the first book and thought it was horrible. I kept reading hoping it would get interesting but alas it left me disappointed. Perhaps you will enjoy it if you love looking into the symbolism of a story. I found it boring and poorly written, if I could I would rate it with no stars."
The New York Trilogy,0143039830,"Paul Auster, Art Spiegelman",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"This book has the rare combination of qualities that qualify it as re-readable. There is enough fibre to it to allow digestion to occur over a long period of time, and each reading will reveal new perspectives.   If at first you're confused and think you've stumbled onto some sort of high-art form of detective novels, you've basically got the right idea. Fortunately, Auster goes much deeper, weaving an intricate and complex thread throughout the stories of this trilogy. Though each can stand on the strength of its tale on its own, together they form a triptych which forces you as the reader to continually refer to each portion again and again."
Esperanza Rising,043912042X,Pam Muñoz Ryan,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Kelty Delaney,"I read the book, Esperanza Rising by Pam Munoz Ryan. It takes place in Aguascalientes, Mexico, 1924. This book starts off with six-year-old Esperanza and her Papa lying on the ground, pressing their ears to the earth. Papa said that if you lay still enough, you could feel its heart beating. He was right, Esperanza could her it. 	All was well for Esperanza, she had a big house with servants for her every need, beautiful dresses and a family that loved her. 	Things did not stay this way though. Six years later, two very large and sad tragedies occurred in a short period of time, which sent Esperanza and her mother to the United States in secrecy in search of work, something Esperanza had never done before. Esperanza found that instead of the fancy clothes she and her mother usually wore, she only had a few pieces of dirty clothing that had once belonged to someone else. Instead of a beautiful house, they shared a cabin without hot water with a family of five. They had each other and Esperanza learned that&rsquo;s all she needed.	 In the winter months they put newspapers on the walls to keep the wind and winter cold out. Shortly after a big dust storm, Mama caught Valley Fever and became very sick. She has to be moved into a hospital and Esperanza became worried she will never see her again. She learns to work in the sheds with the older women to help pay for Mama&rsquo;s medical bills. 	Esperanza quickly discovers that Mexicans are discriminated against in the United States. The people they work for would gladly replace the Mexican workers with workers from Oklahoma, and they were willing to work for less money too. If she and the people around her lost their jobs, they wouldn&rsquo;t have a place to live and no way to pay Mama&rsquo;s medical bills. Soon a strike breaks out and the immigration program does not hesitate to remove any who are part of it and send them to Mexico, even if they have never been there before. 	With so many obstacles to overcome Esperanza clings to the old life she had before leaving Mexico and thinks she is better than most of the people around her.		I enjoyed the book, Esperanza Rising very much. It was a very interesting story and I learned a lot about Mexican discrimination. It taught me to be grateful for what I have around me because there are people who have less, but have greater minds like the people who worked in the Mexican labor camp. The mood changed a lot in the story and I enjoyed those ups and downs a lot, and I almost couldn&rsquo;t put the book down. I would rate this book four stars out of five because I felt it was a little young for me, even though I still enjoyed it. I think it is a perfect book for girls ages nine to thirteen because Esperanza is twelve-years-old and has a young personality. I enjoyed reading Esperanza Rising and I hope people get as much out of it as I did."
Esperanza Rising,043912042X,Pam Muñoz Ryan,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Christina-Burns87,"Esperanza is young girl of wealth and privilege in Mexico, but after her father is murdered on their family ranch. Esperanza and her mother flee to California, there they must work on a potato farm during the great depression. Life is hard and Esperanza mother become ill and Esperanza must speak up for the immigrant workers and their work conditions. 

This book also contains a slight mix of Spanish words and/or phases that are also translated and easy to comprehend. History teacher could collaborate with English/Language Arts teachers when reading this book, because the setting is during the American Great Depression and the Dust Bowl Era."

"Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters & Seymour: An Introduction",0316766941,J.D. Salinger,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"To those who may not be aware, J.D. Salinger's Raise High the Roof Beam
Carpenters and Seymour:an Introduction is the last of three books about
the lives of the fictional Glass family living in New York City at the
beginning of the 20th century. The other two books in the series are Nine Stories, and Franny and Zooey. The Nine Stories introduces the mem-bers of this large extended family, Franny and Zooey tells the lives of
the Glass family's two youngest children and the Raise High (the book in question) tells of the older brother Seymour's planned wedding,
his jilting of his bride and later elopement - the story is told in first-person narrative by his younger brother Buddy as is Seymour, an Introduction. 

The book is an absorbing and often touching chronicle of the lives of all the characters as they cope with their lives in ways both sucess- fully and often not, but you will not be bored. Some may be put off by
the frequent salty language but even so it does not compare to what you
hear in the media nowadays - in any case, this was Salinger's style and
you do go with the flow as you continue reading.

As alluded to above, this is the third book of a series, so for the nar-
rative to make perfect chronological sense, you should start with Nine
Stories, then Franny and Zooey and conclude with Raise High, etc. One
can, I suppose read one and not the others, but a lot would be lost if you did so and really, the tale of this lovably eccentric famlly would simply not make sense. Do yourselves a favor - get all three (especially
at these prices) and enjoy.

P.S. I have left out a lot of details so as not to give anything away -
why spoil the fun?"
"Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters & Seymour: An Introduction",0316766941,J.D. Salinger,Barnes and Noble,4.1,xicanti on LibraryThing,"Two novellas that expand upon Salinger's popular Glass family.  ""Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters"" deals with the day of Seymour's wedding, while ""Seymour - An Introduction"" is Buddy's stream-of-consciousness discussion of his dead brother.I adore Salinger's writing for many, many reasons, but my love rests most firmly on two basic elements: voice and style.  His stories brim with both.  They've got this wonderful elegance to them, even as they flirt with colloquial language and common speech patterns.  He does some truly beautiful things with dialogue and internal monologue; however, I did find it difficult, on occasion, to really get inside Buddy's head.  With another author, I would have found this intensely frustrating, but with Salinger it's all part of the game.  Those brief, wonderful moments where Buddy's whole character just opens up are more than worth the moments of reticence and stylistic cover up.Thematically, I find Salinger's work fascinating in that so much of it deals with dead brothers.  I have a particular - and, admittedly, strange -  fascination with the dead little brother in literature.  It's a surprisingly common theme, (don't believe me?  Just think about it for a bit), and one that Salinger works with in The Catcher in the Rye.  Here, however, he is concerned with something similar but entirely different - namely, the dead older brother.  Though they deal with other things as well, all Salinger's Glass Family stories are influenced by Seymour's suicide.  Anyone who's read Nine Stories or Franny and Zooey already knows what's happened and has seen some of the effects on the family.  ""Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters"" instantly informs the uninitiated that Seymour has killed himself... then changes the game by rewinding and discussing an event in the past, when Seymour was very much alive.  Though he himself makes no appearance in the story, we hear a great deal about him and cannot help but consider what we hear in light of his eventual death.  The story is funny, emotional, and a true slice of human experience, but it becomes something potentially dark through our knowledge of Seymour's fate.""Seymour - An Introduction"" is much more raw.  Salinger has pulled out all the stops this time around.  We already know that Seymour has killed himself.  Now we are invited to consider the effect his death has had on Buddy in a much more visceral way than was previously possible.  Buddy tells us a great deal about Seymour without giving many concrete details.  In fact, when he tries to give the reader anything substantial, he finds himself wandering off into tangents that illuminate his own character as much as Seymour's.  It's a beautiful, engaging, and often frustrating look at literature, family, brotherhood and the self.  There were moments when one of Salinger's images struck me so hard that I burst out laughing.  There were moments when I thought I'd start sobbing wretchedly if I read another word.  Like a previous reviewer, I feel that it adds a great deal to the wider Glass Family story... but I'm not sure I could return to it any time soon.  I found it an emotionally draining read, but I wouldn't take it back for the world.I highly recommend Salinger, but I'm not sure that these stories are really the best place to start.  If you're new to his work, having somehow managed to avoid The Catcher in the Rye in high school and afterwards, I'd say Nine Stories is probably the best place to start.  Save this one for last.  It's beautiful, but it is probably the least accessible of Salinger's works."
"Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters & Seymour: An Introduction",0316766941,J.D. Salinger,Barnes and Noble,4.1,labrick on LibraryThing,"I enjoyed ""raise hit the roof beam, carpenters"" because, to me, it felt like the classic Salinger narrative that's present in ""Catcher in the Rye"" and ""Franny and Zooey"".  It seemed nostalgic, and I found the characters interesting.  ""Seymour: an introduction"" had an entirely different feel to it.  It was more 'stream of consciousness' and the reader felt like a participant (often directly referred to as the subject of a rant).  I would have rated this book higher if it were't for the rambling ""Seymour: an introduction"".  I found it uninteresting and tangential.  The narrative meanders for the entirety of the story and ends with an unsatisfying halt punctuated by the exit of the storyteller; in this case Buddy, Seymour's younger brother. I'm not sure I can point out anything specific that would make this story better.  I just didn't like it."
"The Killing Dance (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, #6)",0425209067,Laurell K. Hamilton,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"The series up until The Killing Dance focuses mainly on Anita Blake and her rapidly growing relationship with the 'monsters' of St. Louis Missouri. However, the series takes a slight turn in subject and begins to circle around the romantic entanglements between Anita and not only Jean-Claude, the Master Vampire of the City, but also the soon to be Ulfric of the local ware-wolf pack, Richard. While the previous books do hold some amount of romantic intrigue, The Killing Dance truly begins this part of Anita Blake¿s life. Don¿t get me wrong, there is some Richard/Anita/Jean-Claude plot line throughout the first of the series, but the romance is nowhere near this intense. This is partly because the character¿s become more of the spotlight rather than the detective and Executioner plot-lines. If you¿re going for the other-worldly urban fantasy/romance read this will be up your ally as would Cerulean Sins, but if you¿re going more for the mystery with an edge read I would suggest something like Obsidian Butterfly or Lunatic Cafe, also by Hamilton.   	The Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter series is one of the few series that can and is sometimes more enjoyable if not read in order. At least that is my opinion. Hamilton has a great talent for reminding readers of the previous plot lines and bringing them up speed, and like wise, if you go back-wards (which I have seemed to do) the short story-line reminders do not bore or interfere with the content and quality of the read."
"The Killing Dance (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, #6)",0425209067,Laurell K. Hamilton,Barnes and Noble,4.4,BK36,"Laurell K. Hamilton's 6th edition to the Anita Blake Vampire Hunter Series,  The Killing Dance, was absolutely phenomenal. It's a must read and will keep you anxious to turn the page.   

Anita Blake,  Vampire Executioner and Animator, vows to protect those she cares about,  including members of the local wolf pack.  When the tables are turned, Richard tries bringing Anita into the pack as one of their new leaders to help protect her. As more challenges for Anita's safety develop, more from inside the pack than outside,  Richard struggles between morality and being a werewolf.

Meanwhile, back at the Circus,  as Jean Claude and Richard compete for Anita's affections,  a visitor from another territory arrives.  While they all struggle to prove a strong power base, and decipher if this new visitor is a threat to Anita and the cause for some of the mishaps that have been going on, the three of them must put their feelings aside to provide a united front. 

The Killing Dance is just what Hamilton's readers love.  This book holds everything we look forward to the most -  Lust, passion, thrill, and suspense. Not to mention the erotic sex and a great plot.  She leaves nothing out in this 6th edition and is sure to leave you wanting more."
"The Killing Dance (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, #6)",0425209067,Laurell K. Hamilton,Barnes and Noble,4.4,bobbles2034,"Read from September 05 to 12, 2012 &mdash; I own a copy, read count: 1

** spoiler alert ** Its funny how when I finished book 5, Bloody Bones, my one concern was that Richard wasn't in the story enough. He had started out as a great character and I really wanted to see how their relationship was going to develop. Don't get me wrong though, I enjoyed Bloody Bones a lot! I sure got what I wanted in book 6, The Killing Dance!! Practically all of book 6 reveled around Anita, Richard, and Jean-Claude.

At this point in the story, I've been waiting for Jean-Claude and Anita to make something happen between them. Now that she was dating both Richard and Jean-Claude I had a feeling i was going to be waiting even longer because of the high morals she holds and the fact she didn't want to give in to Richard and then be forced to give into Jean-Claude.

Book 6 involves very intense scenes between Anita/Richard and Anita/Jean-Claude. It got to the point where you didn't care who she chose you just wanted her to sleep with someone already! And wow my choice surprised me!

The end of the book really took for a surprise as well, not only did Anita choose someone (and sleep with them) there was a pretty big twist at the end. I totally didn't see it coming!

I do have to say I'm not sure how I feel about the end of the story. I feel a little bitter sweet just because of how the story ended. Still a great read though!"
Beyond Good and Evil,014044923X,"Friedrich Nietzsche, R.J. Hollingdale, Michael Tanner",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"This is a must read. It provides valuable insight into the herd and how the herd manipulates the individual. Nietzsche's analysis of society is courageous and bold.    For those that have never read Nietzsche, it may take a while to truly understand this book.    He takes controversial stands, not all of which I am in agreement with. But that is why I am reviewing his book and not mine."
Beyond Good and Evil,014044923X,"Friedrich Nietzsche, R.J. Hollingdale, Michael Tanner",Barnes and Noble,4.5,pingdjip on LibraryThing,"Some of my colleagues are infatuated with Nietzsche, and judging by this book it¿s easy to understand why. In places it sounds considerably poststructural (I work in a literature department). It¿s about complexity (¿our body is, after all, only a society constructed out of many souls¿, section 19), determinism and power-relations. Nietzsche considers language a constituating force (20), tightly linked to experience (268). He undertakes a typology of value systems (186), meaning to expose and to undermine them. He subordinates truth to interest and he questions the reality of oppositions: ¿we can doubt whether opposites even exist¿ (2). This was funny and familiar. But gradually I grew irritated, because of what seemed a continuous promotion of arrogance and rudenes. Please stop bullying supposedly ¿ill¿ and ¿degenerated¿ people, i thought. To make matters worse, he debunked Madame de Stael (233). I¿m a fan of hers. But then my opinion swung again. He deals with the downsides of intellectual distance (chapter 6) in an intriguing way. In chapter 8 he makes broad sweeping statements about european culture, that are, if not really convincing, still interesting. Then, in the concluding chapter, he zooms in on his favorite subject, the ¿noble¿ person. Surprisingly this figure now loses its arrogant looks and adopts an almost tragic countenance, prone to self-destruction and loneliness (269-284). The writing here is very serious and passionate, and results in an embrace of Dionysos, ¿that great ambiguity and tempter god¿ (295)."

It touches on things that we merely brush off, such as the bombing of the church that resulted in the death of those 4 little girls. Very good book!"
The Watsons Go to Birmingham - 1963,044022800X,Christopher Paul Curtis,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"The Watsons Go to Birmingham 1963 was an enlightening and quick-paced story. Very inspirational, it shows the love of an African American family during a segregated period of time. It's a very nice book, although it wasn't amazing. The story in general wasn't very special. Really, I liked it but didn't love it. It just didn't captivate me the way some other books do. The story is based in Flint, Michigan in 1963. The main characters are Kenny, Byron, Joetta, and their parents. The main part of the story tells of adventures in their everyday lives from 10 year old Kenny's point of view. Byron is a bully at school, while Kenny is more of a goody-goody. When the Watsons decide to go to Birmingham, Alabama to visit Grandma, they're in for a wild ride. At this point in the story it really begins to heat up. However, when a tragedy occurs and threatens the well-being of their family, they must leave Alabama. The Watsons must pull together to get past what happened. Overall, this book was ok. It was a bit slow in the beginning, just because it took so long to get into the main plot of the story. It had some high points, very comedic incidents that happened before their trip-like Byron's lips getting stuck on the frosty mirror. In the same sense, it also had low points. Most of these, however, occurred in Birmingham with two horrific events that confused me a bit. In conclusion, I am neutral about this book. I didn't particularly like it, but I didn't dislike it. I wouldn't recommend it, but I wouldn't not recommend it, either. Christopher Paul Curtis did a good job with the character development, but he wasn't as strong with the story line. It was purely just a simple story. It is a quick read which I thoroughly enjoyed. The Watsons go to Birmingham 1963, for the most part, is a really good book."
"The Immortal Rules (Blood of Eden, #1)",0373210515,Julie Kagawa,Barnes and Noble,4.5,The_Busy_Bibliophile,"This book was way more than I was expecting.

Allie and the other &lsquo;Fringers&rsquo; (those unregistered humans that lived in the Fringe) scrounged for supplies in abandoned buildings and homes and hunted rats so they wouldn&rsquo;t have to eat spiders or cockroaches. They barely survived and lived by 1 rule &ndash; every man for himself. But Allie still managed to help her friend Stick when he was too weak to do things for himself. She didn&rsquo;t take crap from anyone and wasn&rsquo;t afraid to punch someone in the face for being a dick. She was a complex character who really went through the ringer. She fought hard just to survive and even agreed to become a soulless bloodsuckers to avoid dying. Once she became a vampire, she fought the urge to become a monster and struggled to maintain her humanity.

This book reminded me of The Host and The Passage because they also were separated into different sections and the protagonist in all of them went on a long journey. This one was separated into 3 parts: Allie&rsquo;s time in the Fringe, her time with Kanin when he taught her to be a vampire and her time with the traveling band of humans. Some of it was a little slow (how many vampire lessons did we really need?) but the action soon picked up. There was some gore, but I wouldn&rsquo;t call it excessive. There were a lot of scares and tense moments and every once in a while I found myself skipping paragraphs just to get past the extra suspenseful parts!

There were also some sweet moments, mostly featuring Zeke. His adopted father was the leader of the group of humans Allie found herself in the middle of for the last quarter of the book. Jebediah clearly had secrets he was keeping from the group and Allie discovered he had some parenting issues I wasn&rsquo;t expecting.

This is my first novel by Julie Kagawa so I don&rsquo;t know if this is exemplary of her writing style, but I just couldn&rsquo;t put this down. It sucked me right in from the beginning and did not let go.

I really dislike the cover. It totally fits the story but it seems so in your face to me. It&rsquo;s saying &ldquo;Hey, look at me with my red eye and gross bloody tears! This is a VAMPIRE novel!&rdquo; I wish it were more subtle."
"The Immortal Rules (Blood of Eden, #1)",0373210515,Julie Kagawa,Barnes and Noble,4.5,RaeLynn_Fry,"It&rsquo;s been a while, I&rsquo;m sad to say, since I&rsquo;ve read a book that&rsquo;s kept me up nights and made me want to skip meals and forsake sleep (two VERY important things in my life) just so I can turn one more virtual page. The Immortal Rules by Julie Kagawa (NYT bestselling author of the Iron Fey series) did that for me.

Thank you, very much, Julie. For not only giving us another fantastically written YA book, but also for supplying the market with a rockin&rsquo; vampire-dystopian that laughs in the faces of sparkly vampire everywhere, and for giving the YA community a kickass heroine (Allie) with a hard attitude and who knows how wield a katana.

This book is a freaking awesome cross between Daybreakers, Last Man Standing, 28 Weeks Later, Resident Evil, and The Road. Don&rsquo;t think it can be done? Wrong. It has been. And it rocks.
What makes this different from every other vampire book out there? Well, for one, there&rsquo;s no obsessively beautiful vampire boy who just wants to fall in love. Secondly, this one&rsquo;s AWESOME. Told from a girl&rsquo;s point of view, it&rsquo;s a book about survival and realizing that there might be something out there worth saving other than your own sorry skin. It portrays vampires as they should be&mdash;vicious killing machines with an animalistic instinct to destroy and survive.
Only two things make this book better than it already is: 1) it&rsquo;s a series, and 2) the film rights have been acquired by Palomar Pictures.

Heck. Yes.

Columbine,0446546933,Dave Cullen,Barnes and Noble,4.4,acoftenreads,"I thought this book would be an interesting read, but I had no expectation that I would be unable to put it down. In a horrifyingly detailed retelling of the events leading up to, during, and following this tragedy, Mr. Cullen exposes the true human weaknesses and darknesses that should terrify anyone who thinks they know the true nature of another person. The boys who committed these acts, and the people around them who could have prevented them from occurring, demonstrate the fragility of the mind and the depths to which a soul can descend. Truly frightening for anyone who has ever been in a position of being, knowing, or observing an adolescent with a secret."

No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden,0525953728,"Mark Owen, Kevin Maurer",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"I've read a lot of the reviews for this book and most of them are not actually reviews but just opinions on the author's motives.  Just about every poor review that is on this site does not actually mention having read the book, but just bashes the author.  

I've read the book.  He claims that no classified information was used.  He claims only unclassified and already made public information was used.  So all those reviews that criticize him for divulging information are clearly wrong and written by people who are reacting without all the facts.  If he put classified information in that book, I'm sure he'll experience the full wrath of the Obama and Holder Department of Justice. 

 I see no dishonor in this account.  There are a lot of people who have retired from the military after having fought in battles overseas and have written their memoirs.  There is nothing wrong with that.  I'm tired of the military top brass and the president's administration using these events to propagandize;  we do not get the truth from the government, no matter whose administration it is.  Remember Jessica Lynch?  We did not get the truth about her capture or rescue from the government.  The best account is from guys like this one.

This is a great book, well written and with lots of personal details that make this guy seem real and human.  We tend to view Navy SEALS as superhuman superheroes and don't really give them credit for the real difficulty and physical sacrifice they make.  Great job!"

When their remains are finally found, the media, linking it without substance, to eight other dead in pairs of two near Williamsburg, Virginia, dub the culprit the Couples Killer.  ---  State Medical Examiner Kay Scarpetta joins the investigation into the latest killings.  Not much data can be gleaned from the skeletons though the killer leaves a glaring jack of hearts at each crime site.  The Feds, state, and local law enforcement trip over each other like the Keystone Cops.  Meanwhile Kay and Richmond homicide detective, Pete Marino, follow the paths, many of which dead end in cul de sacs, left behind by a devious killer made even more complex by a reporter and the Harvey family.  ---  This reprint of an early Scarpetta thriller is a fine entry as a difficult case turns ugly and convoluted by so many participants especially the interference by cops and amateurs.  Kay, her Valkyrie cohorts, and Pete are at their best working through a myriad of potential clues obfuscated by politicians, reporters, cops and family members who devastate crime scenes and more.

I will try to make this as little of a spoiler as possible. It is about a suburban neighborhood in the fictional town of Wentworth, Ohio. A typical afternoon, about a week after Independence Day; the Carver kids are bickering at the corner convenience store; Gary's firing up the backyard grill; the paperboy is making his rounds; a Frisbee is flying over the Reeds' lawn. The only thing that just doesn't seem to fit the almost perfect picture is the red van with the weird radar doohickey thing on the top, idling just up the hill.

Craig Russell, Mike Dringenberg, Malcolm Jones III, Todd Klein, Harlan Ellison",Barnes and Noble,4.3,ltjennysbooks on LibraryThing,"Aw, Season of Mists is great.  I like it so much.  It makes me nostalgic for Past Jenny, who was young and dumb and had yet to discover most of her now-favorite films and music and TV shows (including, of course, the other six volumes of Sandman).  Oh, wow, that¿s really, really true.  I hadn¿t discovered Joss Whedon yet, or The Office, or Doctor Who; I hadn¿t yet seen any of my current five desert island DVDs (fifth series of Buffy, MirrorMask, Empire Records, Angels in America, and Before Sunrise); I didn¿t know the Decembrists, the Shins, Neko Case ¿ I¿m amazed at Past Jenny.  What did Past Jenny do to pass the time?  Sheesh.Anyway ¿ wow, I¿m just amazed at how many awesome things I have discovered since I left high school ¿ anyway, this is the fourth Sandman book, and it starts out with Dream¿s family getting together and sniping at each other until Dream finally decides that it was unfair of him to condemn his ex-lover to hell forever, just because she didn¿t want to be his queen.  So off he goes, to fight the hordes of hell and get her back ¿ it¿s so Dream ¿ and when he gets there, Lucifer has decided to shut down hell.  He gives the key to Dream, and takes himself off; and suddenly Dream is the center of attention from every deity and supernatural power ever, because they all want Hell.I really don¿t like the story where all the dead people come back to the public school.  I seem to recall someone telling me that Neil Gaiman went to Whitgift, in Croydon ¿ it has peacocks and wallabies and flamingos (hee hee hee), but I am beginning to wonder whether it was possibly COMPLETELY SCARRING.  British public schools sound awful.  And not-public schools don¿t seem to be any better.Neil Gaiman¿s obsession with gods, which will come to a head in, no surprises, American Gods, is all too evident here.  You have the Egyptian pantheon, a delegation from the faerie, the Norse lot of Odin, Thor, and Loki, angels from heaven in a supervisory capacity, and demons from hell; they all have things to offer Dream.  Neil Gaiman¿s obviously having fun with all of them, and it is fun ¿ Thor¿s hitting on Bast, and two of the hell demons are having an affair, and a sinisterly lettered little girl from the hordes of chaos giggles when someone gets made into sausages.  It¿s fun, and it wraps up tidily at the end.  Except for the bit about Loki.  That¿s going to turn out worse than you think."

Conventional wisdom says that the protagonist of a story must change, but one of the things I liked most about the Sandman was his immutability, which we first see in the silence that he maintains during his decades of imprisonment in Preludes and Nocturnes. Anyway, Morpheus's spinelessness made the interaction with Hell that forms the connecting story arc of this book much less enjoyable for me than the previous one.

"Origin (Lux, #4)",1622660757,Jennifer L. Armentrout,Barnes and Noble,4.8,AaminahNisa1,"This was an amazing book, just incredible. I have to say the ending did me in just like the last one, but I would expect nothing less from one truly amazing author. This had me in near tears, laughing hard and just plain smiling at the sheer cuteness (if that's even a word) at both Daemon and Katy. I promise you will love it. All hail Jennifer L. Armentrout!"
"Origin (Lux, #4)",1622660757,Jennifer L. Armentrout,Barnes and Noble,4.8,LoverOfBooks0,"One hell of a cliffhanger...

Rarely do I finish reading a book and have nothing negative to say about it. Simply put, Origin was amazing from beginning to end. A lot of gaps were filled in and questions answered. 

Daemon... good lord, do I love his character more and more with each passing installment. He just can't get any better. The dual POV was masterfully done in a  way that didn't create repetition but rather filled in the blanks during the time that Katy was captive. Being inside his head is equal parts amusing and swoon-worthy. His priorities become startlingly clear in this book and does nothing but make you love Daemon Black all the more. 

Katy of one of the most tolerable female main characters ever. Her character is constantly maturing and learning from past mistakes. Readers get to see just how strong Katy is. Her frustrations, terror, and heartbreak made her that much more relatable. And can we just mention DB. How cute was it that she named her lovely little alien after Daemon (even cuter was that he bought the thing for her in the first place). 

In this installment we learn about the various motives behind Daedalus. While some of the motives behind kidnapping hybrids are the furthest from nefarious, other motives are just downright terrible--for example the means to creating origin. Origins, especially those little children of the corn, are freaky. Aside from a select few, I'm not sure what to make of them. Readers also discover that the Luxen are not truly the good guys in this scenario. They are just as bad, if not worse than the Arum. Those who read Obsession already knew that though. Hunter and Daemon... yeah that scene had me laughing and swooning all at the same time.

While the book isn't wholly predictable, certain events were just screaming at me. I'm not surprised by the development between Dawson and Beth. In fact I was calling that one halfway through the book. Matthew, however took me by surprise. I did not expect him to do what he did. Ash and Andrew... can't say I was too surprised by that. Finally there's Archer. I was hoping he would turn out like he did. He's a likable character. Luc's greater involvement in this installment was most welcome. I love Luc's wit and attitude. 

Finally, that ending... what the hell? It's truly the type of cliffhanger that leaves you anxiously awaiting the final installment in the series. I have my predictions and don't think the ending was all that foreboding. Then Jennifer L. Armentrout is not afraid to take it there (as shown in her Covenant series). Here's to hoping things are not as horrible as we're left to believe. I'm putting my faith in Daemon!

Let's discuss the next book... and the fact that it's not due to come out until some unforeseeable summer date. The time has come to sit back and wait (none too patiently). 

Origin is sure not to disappoint. So, if you're wondering whether this book will be as good as the rest of the series then you have nothing to fear. It exceeds expectations."
"Origin (Lux, #4)",1622660757,Jennifer L. Armentrout,Barnes and Noble,4.8,Anonymous,Great book!!  I was laughing and crying throughout the whole thing.  The way Jennifer tells Daemon and Katy's story is so well written that you really feel their ups and downs.  The ending has me wishing that book 5 was already here!!  Great read!!
The Botany of Desire: A Plant's-Eye View of the World,0375760393,Michael Pollan,Barnes and Noble,4.1,songcatchers,"The Botany of Desire is a fantastic book about the co-evolution between us and the plant world. The book is written in four chapters, each chapter being an example of a plant and it's relationship with us. Pollan writes about the apple, the tulip, marijuana and the potato. He starts with the apple and writes about John Chapman (better known as Johnny Appleseed) and his love of ""wildness"". He planted apples not in the rows we see now at apple orchards. He appreciated the more disorderly nature of wilderness. Pollan talks about the tulip and the desire for beauty in chapter two. Chapter three is marijuana and the almost universal desire for intoxication....not only of humans but animals as well. By the end of the book Pollan writes about the potato. We see the opposite end of the spectrum from Chapman's ""wildness"". We see men in lab coats genetically modifying the potato, taking control of it's genes and having their way with them. Pollan's writing is very passionate. His anecdotes along the way (especially his attempt at growing marijuana) are laughable. His love of gardening is saturated in these pages and by the end I was thinking seriously about starting my own garden!"
The Botany of Desire: A Plant's-Eye View of the World,0375760393,Michael Pollan,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"'The Botany of Desire' is a tour de force.  I understand this book as a carefully crafted  warning about the dangers of setting genetically engineered plants loose in the world ecosystem.  The author uses the first three chapters to discuss the co-evolution with humans of the apple, the tulip and cannibis.  These fascinating stories serve to educate the reader to botany and ecology  and bring him or her up to speed for the final chapter that discusses the genetically engineered potato and the adverse or even disasterous effects it may have on the ecosystem.  He summarizes the many unanswered scientific questions that have been raised about this technology and demonstrates that many important questions aren't even being asked.  Throughout, the author beautifully describes the mating of plant culture with human culture, the never-ending dance of Dionysus with Apollo.  This is great literature."
The Botany of Desire: A Plant's-Eye View of the World,0375760393,Michael Pollan,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"When I was given this book as a gift I thought Pollan's entire concept sounded bizarre.  However, once I began reading, I couldn't put it down.  His writing style is superb and his ideas are fascinating and haunting.  I highly recommend this book to everyone.  You'll never think about nature the same way again."

A proposel at Greenbrier would have been nice, or a look into a couple years later when they're married and have a baby girl named Lila or Izabel who was born with one green eye and one gold one!

The Distant Hours,1439152780,Kate Morton,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Mirella,"An ancient castle, dark family secrets, obsession, and madness are at the heart of Kate Morton's newest novel, The Distant Hours.

For most of their lives, a distance has always existed between Edie Burchill and her mother. Then one day, a letter, lost for decades, mysteriously appears. Edie cannot help but burn with curiosity at her mother's reaction and the secrets of her past. 

During World War II, Edie's mother, Meredith, was one of thousands of children evacuated from war torn London into the safety of the English countryside and into Millderhurst Castle owned by the Blythe family. There, Juniper Blythe and her twin sisters, Pen and Saffy, and their father Raymond, the author of a classic children's novel, make a home for the displaced girl. Enchanted by the magnificence of the castle and its family, Meredith is enthralled by her new, but temporary circumstances, and falls in love with her surroundings.   

Decades later, gripped with curiosity of her mother's past, Edie travels to Millderhurst castle and meets the elderly and eccentric Blythe spinsters. Little by little, she discovers the dark secrets that lurk behind the castle walls and the real truth about the distant hours - the not too distant past.

The Distant Hours by Kate Morton is a masterful tale that unfolds slowly, one secret at a time, teasing the reader with every turn of the page. The setting itself is compelling - an ancient castle ravaged by time with plenty of secret rooms and passageways. I found all the characters enigmatic, each with their own fascinating story.  There's a little of everything in this story - love, betrayal, murder, and tragedy and it all lends a powerful ambience from the start of this fabulous story to the powerful end.  Kate Morton writes with detail and deep introspection, making the characters convincing and larger than life.  One cannot help but like this story and admire the clever way it unfolds. I could not put this book down and it kept me awake at night as I was eager to read on to discover the next secret.  It truly is a beautifully written story. If you like a cozy mystery that involves ancient castles with loads of mystery, this is a must to have on your reading list. 

The Distant Hours is scheduled for release in early November.  A very worthy novel that will be a bestseller! I have no doubt."
The Distant Hours,1439152780,Kate Morton,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Gram948,"Somewhere there is a great story lurking in the 560 pages of this book Ms Norton has the flair for a first rate pseudo-gothic novel, however it is buried very deeply under pages and pages of description which adds nothing to the overall atmosphere except to make the book rather dreary.  Would not recommend this to most of my reader friends."
The Distant Hours,1439152780,Kate Morton,Barnes and Noble,3.8,mapp,"Like a previous reviewer I think that this book could have used some better editing and lots less words on the part of the author. Having read and loved the first two books by this author, I pre-ordered and couldn't wait to get this one. There was an interesting plot and some unexpected twists but the book could have been 150 pages shorter and been much more enjoyable."
Beautiful Boy: A Father's Journey Through His Son's Addiction,0618683356,David Sheff,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Sunflower6_Cris,"Beautiful Boy is an amazing (and sad) journey that David Sheff describes about his son Nic and his addiction with Methamphetamines.  This book provides a personal parent's point of view of the rollercoaster life that his family and his son endured during his son's drug addiction. 
This book was so easy to read and understand coming from a family who has endured drug additions.  
I didn't want the story to end when I finished the book. I wondered what happened to him and his son. Have they been able to get through these past years?  Is Nic still struggling with addition and recovery? I look forward to reading Nic's book, ""Tweak"" to see the other side of the story."

Beautiful Boy: A Father's Journey Through His Son's Addiction,0618683356,David Sheff,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"I would highly recommend this book to any family going through the anguish & heartbreak of a chemically addicted member. The author is fortunate that he had the means to afford all the intervention programs his son attended. The son is fortunate that he has a family that still cares after they have been let down and betrayed time & time again. Although I gained a lot of insight on a very destructive problem, I would not wish this nightmare on any family."

Metamorphoses,014044789X,"Ovid, David Raeburn, Denis Feeney",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,I have trouble with the 'endless poem' format used in so many classic translations.  This is much much better. Miller's prose is FANTASTIC.  I found myself going back over the text numerous times from being so impressed.  Not to mention the timeless beauty of Ovid's mythology.
Metamorphoses,014044789X,"Ovid, David Raeburn, Denis Feeney",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"One of the most beautiful pieces of literature ever written, in my opinion. This translation was perfect, fluid, and what I believe to be easy for all to fall in love with."
Metamorphoses,014044789X,"Ovid, David Raeburn, Denis Feeney",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Dierckx,"Publius Ovidius Naso was born in 43 B.C and died in 18 A.D. 
He was banished for unknown reasons to Tomi, a barren place near the coast of the Black Sea. A few scholars believe that this was a literary hoax created by Ovid himself. It would enable him to write the 'Tristia' and 'Letters From The Black Sea'. 
'Metamorphoses' is his main achievement. It contains 250 stories from the Greek Mythology and they all have in common that the principal character changes into another form. Most of the time they turn into an animal or a tree but also in a river, a constellation of stars, a rock or a flower and other pleasant surprises. 

If you read this book you won't find many happy endings. The ancient Greeks didn't know the meaning of that expression. 
It's not an easy read but if you persist it will be a rewarding literary experience."

It is a wonderful novel through the interpretation of Julia Alavarez. She made it so that it sounded very believable  it felt like an actual account.She brings their spirits and this time back to life in a charming story.  The book was kind of confusing at first in the beginning through the eyes of Dede's nostalgia,because you needed to know the whole story. After I read through it, though, it explained itself'the story is mainly told in flashbacks'. In the time of Trujillo's dictatorship in the Dominican Republic, these sisters had the courage to risk their lives for their beloved country. They made a big impact. In my opinion, it's more of a feminine book. I recommend it, though, so go ahead and enjoy! =]"

Gap Creek,0743203631,Robert Morgan,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Guest,"After the final disgusting scene in the first chapter I knew I shouldn't waste my time on this all too self-possessed effort to depress and wear on the reader. I've always been leary of 'Oprah Picks' but this one takes the prize. Do the editors at Oprah's show pick such bad novels on purpose? From the death of her little brother from worms (which is unneccesarily graphically portrayed) to her struggles against her strange husband (whose character annoyingly is never really explained or developed thoroughly by the author), the protangonist, a young woman in her late teens named Julie, is slapped hard incessantly by her circumstances. I just wanted a break from it. Although it was an easy read (day and a half, thankfully no longer) I found myself wishing that the protangonist would just go home to her mama and forget about Gap Creek. She and her bizarre husband eventually do, but it's too late to save the effort. Try a different novel. Don't waste your time on this one."

I get tired enough thinking about my own housework; I certainly don't care to read about someone else's boring chores, no matter how hard the chores may be! And what's with the weenie men?

I love Alex. Despite all the horrible things she's been through, she can still laugh and be snarky. She's strong and courageous. She doesn't back down from a fight (even when she should). She doesn't understand the decisions of those around her or what they're keeping from her.  Alex has been away from the Covenant for 3 years. When she returns, Aiden (swoon!) is in charge of her training. Aiden is different from the other pures. He's kind, patient, and he doesn't look down on her like the others. Only problem is, he's forbidden. And who doesn't want what they can't have?!  This world of pures, halfs, and daimons will suck you in and hold you."
"Half-Blood (Covenant, #1)",0983157200,Jennifer L. Armentrout,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"This book is very similar to that of Rachelle Mead's Vampire Academy... Its similar concept-wise right from th begining (the whole pures/halfs/diamons versus Mead's moroi/dhampirs/strigoi, not to mention the elemental connections and super cool boarding schools where they are trained to kill). It gets just plain insulting though once you get to the part in the office... god you could almost literally substitue the words mentioned from the book with strigoi, rose and dimitri and you would have Vampire Academy. Its otherwise well written and interesting but it looses a ton of points in my book for being a stolen idea. I mean, come on. Thats just pathetic. If this book interests you, trust me, go buy Meads series, its much better written as well in my opinion.

If youre looking for a cheaper version and a stolen idea this is the book for you. Im wishing I wouldn't have bought this now if only out of loyalty."

I have had to buy Bitter several times because I've either worn it out or loaned it out and it got passed so far that it was lost.  This is her real story of riches-to-rags, love, and a bad-luck purse.  She is bitingly sarcastic, witty, and sometimes just downright mean, but you can't help to love her.  The footnotes take a little getting used to, but the story flows so seemlessly it's hard to put down.  And we all know where we were when her downturn happens.   I recommend this book to people who enjoy biographies, chic lit, sex and the city, sarcasm, designer apparel, girly drinks, and really good books."

"Blindsighted (Grant County, #1)",0380820889,Karin Slaughter,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Schmooby-Doo,"The NOOK version: Worth the price! The characters are complex and flawed, and you are not sure what will happen to one of them, even at the end of the book. It is pretty graphic, with attention to detail, especially in the morgue. She describes her characters well, so you feel you are getting to know them. What I found really interesting is I wasn't sure how much I liked these people, no one was really someone you really rooted for. The author lets you in on details as the book progresses --- which was great! I didn't guess who the villain was until about halfway through and didn't guess why until towards the end. I would recommend this book, just beware --- it's pretty grisly in parts. If it were a movie, I'd probably rate it R or PG-13 at the very least."

"Through the Ever Night (Under the Never Sky, #2)",0062072064,Veronica Rossi,Barnes and Noble,4.6,MarkedByBooks,"Veronica Rossi has done it again. I really, really didn't think it could get any better after Under the Never Sky. It is very rare that an author can manage to pull of a sequel to a highly acclaimed novel that manages to be just as good as the first. In the first book of a series, everything is new and exciting. You've never met any of these characters before, and sometimes you get a whole new world to discover. You can't possibly beat that.

Well, Veronica Rossi managed to do just that in Through the Ever Night. I loved this book so much that I can't even possibly describe it in my own words without putting it to shame. It was so incredible that I'm just speechless. And I've had a few months to process it already.

The thing about this book that allowed it to be just as good as its predecessor is that it was still willing to keep things fresh without destroying everything we learned in the first novel. There is nothing that I can't stand more than an author who runs out of ideas for their books but keeps making up things to keep the story going anyways. This DOES NOT happen here.

I was able to learn more things about this world and the characters within it because they grew and offered new possibilities. But they were still the same characters that I fell absolutely, head-over-heels in love with in Under the Never Sky.

Aria is still an extremely strong heroine but has her own faults so that she appears human. Perry is responsible and loyal to a fault, especially to those who don't deserve him. Cinder is a troubled child with a history that nobody has heard until now. He's lost everything he's ever cared about, and now that he's found a new home, he will do anything to protect it.

And Roar. There are no beautifully lyrical thoughts that I can give to describe him because he'd probably twist them into something either extremely suggestive or hilarious (probably both) and I'd die of laughter. He's just too awesome to contain himself, and he knows it. He will do anything to bring a smile to the faces of those he cares about, and he's just a huge teddy bear. I've become more attached to Roar than any other character.

Though the Ever Night pulled me around on an intense emotional roller coaster. I know that sounds cheesy, but there's really not a better way to describe what happened. One moment I would be flying with joy because my favorite characters are all together and happy, and the very next I'm nearly in tears because I don't know if they'll ever be that way again.

For me, emotional books can be very scary. I'll experience a whole range of feelings that I probably didn't even know I was capable of, but the one thing that is not acceptable is anger. I am absolutely not allowed to get mad at the book I'm reading because then I'm automatically thrown out of that world to silently seethe in my own. I don't want to do that. I may be allowed to get mad at the characters for doing stupid things, but if I get mad at the actual book, it looses all of its magic. The task of navigating the line between the two is no small feat, but this book managed to do just that. I want to thank Veronica Rossi from the very bottom of my heart for creating such an incredible novel for me to get lost in, and filling it with so much perfection that I just don't know what to do with other than embrace with everything inside of me. Thank you.

Taylor"
"Through the Ever Night (Under the Never Sky, #2)",0062072064,Veronica Rossi,Barnes and Noble,4.6,IspeakINbookQUOTES,"Veronica Rossi is such a beautiful writer. I can't even begin to explain how much I loved this book and Under The Never Sky. The love story between Aria and Perry was perfect, it never over shadowed the plot and it wasn't cheesy and sappy either. I loved the character development of Roar (he's one of my all time favorites) and I love how his and Aria's relationship deepened...the closest you can get without being romantically linked to eachother. I cannot wait to see what happens with them all in the next book!  Thank you Veronica!"
"Through the Ever Night (Under the Never Sky, #2)",0062072064,Veronica Rossi,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,Excellent!  I love her writing style - she pulls you in right from the start. I loved the first book and this was a fantastic follow-up.
Barefoot,0316018589,Elin Hilderbrand,Barnes and Noble,3.8,TheChicCherryBlossom,"This was my first novel by Elin Hilderbrand.  It was a bit hard to get into at the beginning, but I read on nonetheless. Soon the pace picked up and I became attached to the story and characters.  Each of them comes from a different background and stage of life, yet they all share the common thread of being in the midst of a journey to grow and find themselves despite the challenges they're facing.  

It was easy to get emotionally invested in each of their stories, and I found myself not wanting to put the book down because I wanted to know how it would all turn out.  Wrought with real emotion, genuine love, and heartbreaking circumstance, I think you would be hard pressed to find yourself disappointed in this one.  A light summer beach read it is not; instead, it quickly establishes itself as a more serious story that leaves a warm feeling behind at its conclusion."
Barefoot,0316018589,Elin Hilderbrand,Barnes and Noble,3.8,BLUEEYEBE,"I became immersed in this story of these very interesting, complex women and the major man, not to mention the two little children. Reading about Vicki's cancer had me physically going through it with her. I found the characters so multi-dimensional that I felt as if I knew them."
Barefoot,0316018589,Elin Hilderbrand,Barnes and Noble,3.8,LAJR,I glanced at the detail of this book because the price was low. At first I didn't want to read it but I decided to give it a go on my NOOK. All I can say is GREAT! This book is a definite keeper and re-read. There are some serious topics that make you think outside of the box. I also learned a lot on various subjects. The characters pull you in and you are able to identify with some part of each one. Even the philosophical parts held my interest and made me want to know more. I was very pleasantly surprised!
Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,0811216012,Tennessee Williams,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"I think that this book was good for a researh book to read, but I would only reccommend it if one understands the ending.. IF anyone has criticism on this novel please e-mail me!!!!!!"
Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,0811216012,Tennessee Williams,Barnes and Noble,3.9,HotWolfie on LibraryThing,"This is my favorite Tennessee WIlliams play.  All of the characters are distinctive and unique, and there is a lot of substance to the story.  Maggie ""The Cat"" is a character that really sinks her claws into the audience.  The dialog is raw and compelling, and it's interesting to read about characters who strike out so cruelly at each other, but still harbor love for one another.  This is a play about infidelity, homosexuality, greed, unrequited love, and family drama."
Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,0811216012,Tennessee Williams,Barnes and Noble,3.9,StephenBarkley on LibraryThing,"I know I'm supposed to adore this book. It's one of America's premiere plays. ""Winner of the Pulitzer Prize"" is proudly stamped on the cover. Unfortunately, it just doesn't seem to resonate with me. Perhaps it's because I'm a minister, and this is a story of horrible relationships that would take any pastoral counselor ages to sort out.The dialogue is quick and brilliant¿I'd love to see it performed live. Williams did a fantastic job of displaying broken relationships; he just forgot to provide any hope for his characters' future. In both versions of the third act, the resolution can hardly be considered even a minor step forward between husband and wife.If you're the sort of person who draws hope from relationships that are more damaged than your own, this might interest you. If you're looking for an example of the human condition¿family dynamics gone awry¿this is an excellent case-study. I suppose I was looking for something more."
"The Final Warning (Maximum Ride, #4)",0316002860,James Patterson,Barnes and Noble,4.2,A_girl_with_a_story,"I LOVED the first three books of this series, and when I heard there was a fourth book coming out I was super excited! I got it the day it came out, read it, and haven't touched it since. The first three books were very well written, and very funny. Max is a hilarious character! The action was pretty good and it was a good story line. The third one was a little weird, there were so many plot twists, but I still liked it. However, this fourth one was just disappointing. I mean, global warming is a great cause and all, but is this just going to become yet ANOTHER ""don't pollute!"" and ""save the environment!"" things? I mean, is this why the flock was created is to stop global warming?...I wasn't really too impressed by this book. I've seen how this author can write, and if he's out of ideas then just STOP writing and don't ruin a great series. I think you should leave global warming and (in this case) maximum ride apart. If James Patterson thinks we should be more aware of global warming, then he can write a book about global warming that people can read if they want to. But for us Maximum Ride fans, we just want the witty, action packed stories we fell in love with in the first three books."
"The Final Warning (Maximum Ride, #4)",0316002860,James Patterson,Barnes and Noble,4.2,BookwormKD,"this series is my *pause for dramatic effect* NEW FAVORITE. its even better then twilight - I'm not even kidding. saying it's my favorite is a big step for me - LOL - because before i read twilight i had many MANY favorites but twilight quickly jumped to the #1 spot in the ""books i've read"" reading list i keep up in my head. i had no doubt that it was going to stay there in the #1 spot for a long long long long long time - if not forever. but then came the maximum ride series and as i read it i mentally made it climb the list of books until it bumped twilight right down to numero dos. this book is very interesting, exciting, and unpredictable. i think the part i loved the most is the writing style. even if the situation they were in was the worst they had faced yet, james patterson managed to make me laugh (out loud) at the funny things that the members of the flock said. i was so into the story as i was reading it was unbelievable. i loved how it was written in max point of veiw and how the reader wasn't part of the story but wasn't out of it either. it grabbed my attention from the very first page and didn't let go. it was about adventure and misunderstanding and confusion and mystery and near death fights and high speed chases and flying. and its about them realizing that family is the most important - even when your family consits of 5 mutant bird kids. i recommend the rest of this series ( i havn't read MAX yet but im sure it will be great) and also the host if you like science fiction. if you can't find anything to read then check out my b&n page for more books that i recommend :)"
"The Final Warning (Maximum Ride, #4)",0316002860,James Patterson,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"I will try to say this without ruining the rest of the series...

          I have read the entire Maximum Ride series at least 879,463,684 times. I have always felt this book didn't belong. It doesn't fully connect with the rest of the series. Sure there are comments and remarks and memories about what happened in here but thats it. 
          I feel given my expertise in this series is that you could read the entire Maximum Ride series except this book and still fully understand everything. James Patterson, i love u man and i m a HUGE fan, but i feel this is one of your lesser works. Sure this still feels like a Maxium Ride adventure. Twists and turns, plot twists, and excitment at mostly every turn. And the occasional emotional scene. But still... Why write this how u did or at all? I just don't quite understand.
          I m not saying ""don't read this book, it's not worth my time."" This book is still a great read. It will still keep you guessing what will happen next. Butkeep this review in mind.

"Golden Fool (Tawny Man, #2)",0553582453,Robin Hobb,Barnes and Noble,4.6,BluHawk,"Hobb is my ultimate fall-back author. If ever I find myself in need of a guaranteed good read, I pick up a FitzChivalry novel. I love that the story evolves and that I every time I read it, I am immediately immersed right back into the world. I think these should be on the must-read list for any sci-fi / fantasy lover. Great characters, great story, and overall: extremely memorable! If you liked this book, I bet you will also like the ""Magician"" series by Raymond E. Feist (Particularly from book 3 on...) as well as his ""Conclave of Shadows"" series. I also think you would like ""Dragon Weather"" by Lawrence Watt-Evans, ""A Shadow in Summer"" by Daniel Abraham, and ""Thief's Gamble"" by Juliet E. McKenna."
"Golden Fool (Tawny Man, #2)",0553582453,Robin Hobb,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Grandpa,"As in many trilogies, book two is just filler between the beginning and the end. So is the case here. I was hoping to at least resolve the issue as to wheather the Fool is a woman, (dissapointing), or a man. As much as I like Robin Hobb's work, I found myself saying, ""just what the heck was that chapter about?"". The character plots meander all over the place, the story line seems to bog down with too many loose ends, awaiting book three. I managed to finish it, because of my devotion to Hobb, and anticipate satisfying endings to all the issues in book three. Having said that, If you like Hobb, you will find enough to make this a satisfying, if skimpy meal."
"Golden Fool (Tawny Man, #2)",0553582453,Robin Hobb,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Guest,"Robin Hobb is by far one of the greatest writers I have ever read.  This installment of the Farseer saga is definitely the best so far; it was almost physical agony to put it down!  From the beginning, in Assassin's Apprentice, I was drawn in by Hobb's portrayal of her characters; they are so real, so human...I genuinely feel affection for and a deep connection with Fitz and the rest of the cast (I didn't feel as strongly about the Liveship characters, perhaps because they were experienced through the third person perspective).  It was heart-wrenching watching Fitz as he became distanced from those whom he loves most; the fight with the Fool nearly brought tears to my eyes!  But that is part of what makes these novels so enchanting...Hobb's characters are far from perfect and make mistakes just like you and me.  And if deeply detailed, complex characters aren't enough for you, the plot has enough twists and turns to keep your attention riveted for hours on end.  I definitely recommend reading the Farseer and Liveship Trader trilogies before starting the Tawny Man series, as Golden Fool loses a lot of its impact otherwise.  I was clearly too enraptured with the plot and inter-person relationships of the book to catch the slip made with Malta; she is Althea's niece, not her sister.  However, considering that everything else about this book is perfect, I do not think that the mistake warrants a two-star deduction.  I have already started reading the next book, Fool's Fate.  Normally, I wait for the paperback edition, but there was no way I wouldn't have been able to wait a few hours to follow my friends on their adventure, much less the many months before the paperback was released.  But, I digress...the point I want to convey is that this book, this author, is as magnificent as they come.  You absolutely MUST read these novels; you will not be disappointed!"
"Split Second (Sean King & Michelle Maxwell, #1)",0446614459,David Baldacci,Barnes and Noble,3.9,DewdLM,As a retired cop I was a little hesitant to start this series about federal cops but I found this very believable and a great read.
"Split Second (Sean King & Michelle Maxwell, #1)",0446614459,David Baldacci,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,It reads incredibly fast.  The ending is what just killed me.  Everything was tied together in about two pages it seemed like.  Plus the ending itself was surprisingly horrible.  Still worth reading though I couldn't put it down till I was finished.

"The Fifth Witness (Mickey Haller, #5; Harry Bosch Universe, #20)",0316069353,Michael Connelly,Barnes and Noble,3.8,The_Reading_Reviewer,"Mickey Haller has always played it a little to the left of respectability and liked it there.  He learned how to play the game well from his late father reputed to be the greatest lawyer ever to hit the legal system.  Mickey is a great guy, wonderful father and not to bad ex-husband, but with the legal system it is all about the check mark in the win column and how you get there is not the issue but the answer.  But when you are faced with doing something that even crosses your line what are you going to do?

Now that times are a little rough economically Mickey is dealing with the lucrative foreclosure market.  This new avenue to obtain clients is paying well and still lets him keep his office in the back of his Lincoln, traveling around from one court house to another kicking legal butt.  But when one of his foreclosure clients is accused of killing the banker who is about to kick her out of her house Mickey get back in full lawyer mode and takes this one head on.  Mickey never asks if his client did the deed he just asks ""can you cover my retainer and do you have a credit card that can handle the monthly charge""?

But this client is setting off even Mickey's sense of something is not right when the pieces of the crime too perfectly don't fit the client or her ability to have murdered the banker.  When she makes bail and shows up with her movie producer the situation goes from bad to ridiculous with Mickey indignant and threatening breach of contract.  But this time perhaps Mickey took on something he can't handle and finds out quickly someone does not like his courtroom tactics and he winds up in the hospital after a brutal attack.  This may be a murder case, but it is definitely one that appears be a guilty client committing the perfect crime he just can't figure out how.

Michael Connelly consistently knows how to write a great mystery with characters that show up and get the job done with every book.  The stories are always current with a twist of what is going on in the world around us and they never stop surprising me with their depth and ability to follow the leads through regardless of where they take them.  I thought The Lincoln Lawyer was going to be Mickey Haller's best story written but this one showed me how wrong I am.  Pay attention as you read this book because the nuisances will shock you in the end if you miss them and you will find yourself going back to figure out ""where did I miss that clue at""?"
"The Fifth Witness (Mickey Haller, #5; Harry Bosch Universe, #20)",0316069353,Michael Connelly,Barnes and Noble,3.8,KenCady,"I had hit a spell of books that did not stir my interest, so I was pleased to spend a few hours in the court room with Micky Haller, who, of course, now looks just like Mathew McConaughey from the film version of The Lincoln Lawyer. Michael Connelly is an author who can write a courtroom drama without messing up the reality of how a court really works. He maintains the suspension throughout- I finished it all in one day. There are plenty of surprise twists, and I ended up rooting for Mickey to have a bright future."
"The Fifth Witness (Mickey Haller, #5; Harry Bosch Universe, #20)",0316069353,Michael Connelly,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Kataman1,"This engaging courtroom thriller is by far Mr. Connelly's best Lincoln Lawyer tale to date!  This time Mickey Haller has jumped on the foreclosure bandwagon and is servicing clients who are about to lose their house.  One of those clients is Lisa Trammel who has started a protest group that against her bank that garners national attention.

When the Bank Officer servicing Lisa's loan is murdered, Lisa is the prime suspect and it is up to Mickey to defend her.  Through the handling of Lisa's mortgage case against the bank, Mickey knows that there were a lot of ""fishy"" practices going on and that Lisa may have been set up.   The courtroom drama is intense and Mr. Connelly has the reader hooked on every sentence of the narrative.

Mr. Connelly also paints a picture of LAPD law enforcement (with the exception of Harry Bosch) working with ""tunnel vision,"" meaning that once they have a possible suspect, they ignore all leads not related to the suspect and only pursue what will make a case against that suspect.  This may in part be due to the economics of doing an investigation.  The prosecution in this case seems to only be interested in seeing the accused go down and to discount any other ""theories"" of what may have occurred, especially if those paths may point to a different individual as the perpetrator of the crime.

Mr. Connelly also gives us more insight into Mickey's supporting team, especially his investigator Cisco.  Mickey seems to have evolved from the ""sleezy"" lawyer we had seen in the first Lincoln Lawyer novel and is now a relentless pursuer of getting to the truth.  There are also some surprises with Mickey's evolving ""post-married"" relationship with Maggie, his ex.

I thoroughly enjoyed this book from start to finish and look forward to more Mickey stories!"

"The Dragonbone Chair (Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn, #1)",0756402697,Tad Williams,Barnes and Noble,4.4,DevoursFantasy,"Out of the older tradition of fantasy writing, this one takes its time and builds slowly, carefully, meticulously, until we have a world and conflict that feels real and surprising in the present with the depth that a long history provides. Really good stuff if you're patient enough to let it simmer. What I would consider to be the introduction takes about 200 pages. Even then, it's not really until the end of this first book in the series that it really reaches the pace and depth that spurs you on to pick up the rest - immediately. No, it's not your quick fantasy fix, but it's infinitely more satisfying than the easy in-easy out fantasies that abound these days."

I am now reading the second book and can't wait to get started on the 3rd. I love Father Tim, watching the human side of the clergy is something we seem to forget they are, Human."
"At Home in Mitford (Mitford Years, #1)",1589190629,Jan Karon,Barnes and Noble,4.2,EGHunter01,"Review title: Marvelous Mitford.
Our protagonist, Father Tim, is rather charming, delight-filled, and down-to-earth. You'll probably &quot;fall in love&quot; with Barnabas, what a true friend. This small town parish story is sure to amuse and entertain you if you enjoy novels about the Christian faith and how the love of God is revealed in the lives of God's people. You will feel &quot;at home in Mitford&quot; as you read about this congregation and this wonderfully &quot;spun&quot; tale."

"Scorpia (Alex Rider, #5)",0142405787,Anthony Horowitz,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"In Anthony Horowitxz's thriller, ""Scorpia"" Alex Rider, a teen spy, will stop at nothing to find his destiny. Scorpia is the name for a top secret criminal organization led by a woman named Julia Rothman. The latest project that the group has been working on is called, 'Invisible Sword."" This is a plan that will break the alliance between The United States Of America and Great Briton. Alex knows that Scorpia, holds the secrets behind the mysterious death of his father, John Rider. As the plot unfolds, fourteen year old Alex Rider finds himself joining this criminal organization, in pursuit of revenge for the death of his dad. He is sent to an island off the coast of Italy, where he will receive elite training in the arts of sabotage, intelligence, and assassination. Alex's first mission with Scorpia, is to secretly kill Mrs. Jones who is in charge of another intelligence organization called ""MI6"" who is responsible for his fathers death. However, unexpected obstacles prevent Alex from carrying out the mission, and he is arrested by MI6. Alex soon realizes that, Scorpia has been lying to him all along, and in reality they had been the ones who had killed both of his parents. He also finds out that Scorpia's latest project, ""Invisible Sword"" is an evil  plot that will kill thousands of twelve to thirteen year olds across England. they will achieve this by creating a new flue vaccination that contains tiny particles called nanoshells that are full of cyanide. Satellite dishes will activate the nanoshells and release the cyanide into the children's blood stream. Now that Alex knows the truth about his father, and what is about to happen to thousands of children, he is more motivated than ever to do something about it. When time is about ready to run out, Alex shows up with a device that will disable the satellites. However, Julia Rothman realizes what he is attempting to do, and breaks the device before he can stop this great atrocity from happening. Alex doesn't give up here though, he climbs to the top of a hot air balloon, killing all the guards in his way, and disables the satellite dishes himself. I thoroughly enjoyed this thrilling novel, because of how exciting and extravagant it was to read and I would recommend it to anyone. the intricate plot and elaborate characters would keep any reader entertained from cover to cover."
"The Queen of the Tearling (The Queen of the Tearling, #1)",0062290363,Erika Johansen,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"This was an entertaining book for a first time author.  However, she really eviscerated anyone over 40 in this book, leading me to believe she is a young author.  She had a scene that was particularly mean, describing an ""ancient woman"" in her forties.

A few plot holes.  Not a lot of insight into how this post-apocalyptic country came to be.  Very graphic descriptions of sex, so don't let young girls read this.

The heroine is supposed to be similar to Queen Elizabeth.  I will buy the second book for entertainment, but all the hype of promotion of this book seemed a bit excessive."
"The Queen of the Tearling (The Queen of the Tearling, #1)",0062290363,Erika Johansen,Barnes and Noble,4.4,irishclaireKG,"Well, This is Really Closer to Two and a Half Stars                                                                  ...but I'll round it up to three for the beautiful, old-fashioned cover complete with a lovely silken bookmark.  As for the rest?  It's a mishmash of 'stuff' which utterly contradicts itself and falls into illogic a great deal of the time.  If that does not bother you, then it is an enjoyable but slight book.  Expect to find plot devices from 'Hunger Games' (even the term 'tribute' is used), 'Game of Thrones,' Harry Potter (there's a direct acknowledgement of the 'Rowling collection' as part of preserved books), 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' (watch out for Ark of the Covenant zapping accessories), 'Mean Girls' ('Fetch', really??) and many others.  What really irked, me, however, is the chaotic  backstory.  The convoluted history of The Tearling (and this whole world) is never clearly explained--we are never sure where this all takes place (defunct America? Europe?),  what really happened with the Crossing and why (it actually sounds like the Pilgrims coming to the New World)...all the action takes place in a decidedly medieval setting complete with armor, castles, serfdom, 12th century weapons...fear of witches and magic...there is no real medicine yet there are references to antibiotics, transplants, and contraception...there are no longer books but knowledge of print readers...it's a total jumble.  Kelsea is schooled as a queen but most of personal and political history has been kept  from her: what's the point of a largely clueless queen?!  But she trudges on displaying gross shallowness one minute (wondering why ugly people have the audacity to wish being pretty) then in the next paragraph displaying wisdom beyond all others.  There is the predictable crush on the Bad Boy (shades of Robin Hood there)...my impression was that this had no clue what it was supposed to be.  It's a trilogy so are we going to get ALL these answers in other books?  We needed a whole lot of them for this book.  Emma Watson is evidently going to do the movie--hope it's more cohesive than this.  It's not a terrible book--it's just sort of all over the place."
"The Queen of the Tearling (The Queen of the Tearling, #1)",0062290363,Erika Johansen,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"What an over-hyped mess of a book.  I wanted to like The Queen of the Tearling, but I would have had to suspend a desire for decent world building, basic character development and a plot that made sense.  Here are just a few of the overwhelming problems with this story.
In many ways The Queen of Tearling is poorly derivative of the Girl of Fire and Thorns series by Rea Carson.
QotT is written in the most simple and (very) Young Adult style, except for rape references, pedophilia, and gratuitous torture&mdash;all of which seem to be thrown in for no apparent reason and are jarring juxtaposed against the juvenile style. 
The heroine, Kelsea, is obsessed with everyone&rsquo;s looks, especially her own.  (As an aside, I found it peculiar and inexplicable that if a female was depicted as attractive she was a victim of abuse, a whore, or evil&mdash;no other options).
It&rsquo;s stressed over and over how plain and overweight she is, which could have been interesting in the hands of an author who understands human nature.  Kelsea has very cringe-inducing notions about how to behave&mdash;for instance, after an assassination attempt; her group of guards (men she&rsquo;s only known for a week or so) glimpses her nude body before she grabs a towel.  But Kelsea is annoyed with herself for this perceived &ldquo;vanity&rdquo; and later tends to have a pathetic need to get naked in front of these hapless men to prove she&rsquo;s not vain.  Seriously, in Kelsea&rsquo;s mind it&rsquo;s &ldquo;vain&rdquo; to keep your clothes on in front of a bunch of strangers old enough to be her father.   
The dialogue is awful.  Kelsea either repeats whatever someone just said, or if her silly ideas of what to do are challenged, she says something like, &ldquo;I think you can figure it out.&rdquo;  Really. Most of the time when Kelsea spoke, I was hoping someone would finally tell her to shut up and learn something about life first.
Kelsea also falls instantly in puppy-love with a serious creep who humiliated and threatened to kill her&mdash;and the only reason given is because he&rsquo;s hot.  Really.
These Queen&rsquo;s Guards, who are supposed to be the best of the best badasses are lame.  While escorting Kelsea through dangerous lands, they get drunk and loud at night when there is the constant threat of ambush.  When they are presented with clear proof that there is a traitor in their midst, the leader, Mace, only throws a fit.  In fact Mace, who for some reason everyone fears, is constantly bragging about how he knows things and is never wrong&mdash;yet he&rsquo;s constantly wrong, and constantly fails.
There&rsquo;s an evil queen, who is beautiful of course, which seems to be the only reason she is evil. 
And the magic? It is only a plot device&mdash;Dues ex machina at its worst. 
	But the worst thing by far is the preachy and condescending style of the writing.  This author writes as if the idea of helping the poor is her own original idea.  I&rsquo;ve gone on enough, but there&rsquo;s so much more that fails the logic test in this over-hyped and unoriginal book.
If you're looking for good examples of Fantasy, these authors deliver&mdash;Robin Hobb, Sarah J. Maas, Andrew Ryan, and Patrick Rothfuss."
"One False Note (The 39 Clues, #2)",0545060427,Gordon Korman,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Amajorbibliophile,"""The 39 Clues: One False Note,"" by Gordon Korman is the second book in Scholastic's popular book series, ""The 39 Clues.""  Although readers may think that the first one would be better, considering it is by Rick Riordan, author of the acclaimed ""Percy Jackson and the Olympians"" series, this book is definitely not a disappointment!  Gordon Korman did an extremely good job making the characters' personalities the same as they were in the first one and making sure the clues are just as hard to figure out!"
"One False Note (The 39 Clues, #2)",0545060427,Gordon Korman,Barnes and Noble,4.4,redmomdawn,"My son and I have been reading the 39 clues series and thoroughly enjoyed volume 2.  We have already pre-ordered #3 and have completed the online challenges as well.  I highly recommend these books for anyone with kids in the ""tweener"" stage.  Because the main characters are a brother-sister team ranging in age from 11-14, I think it would be appealing for both boys and girls and catch the attention of a sometimes difficult age group."
"One False Note (The 39 Clues, #2)",0545060427,Gordon Korman,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"The False Note is the second 39 clues book; by Gordon Kormon, it is a fictional novel.  I loved this book because it always had you on your toes.  You think one thing will happen, but the total opposite will happen.  The story started in Germany, then went to Venice in the modern time setting. 
Dan, main character, his sister Amy, and their au pair, Natalie have to get the second clue to win the contest before the rest of the family finds it and figures it out.  Dan almost dies because Dan and Amy got two pages from Mozart's sister's diary, from the Janus part of the family.  Dan has to think fast because everything is happening and it goes very quickly.  Dan also had to be careful so none of his family would find him and try to kill him.  They would like to kill him because the family thinks that Grace (grandmother who started this whole thing) gave them a clue to help them win the contest.
The author uses humor in his writing and he also uses writing that kids would say now.  The age period that should read The False Note is 9-13 and older if they want.  If enjoy being surprised almost every chapter and never know what is going to happen next.  You will love the The False Note."
"Tithe (Modern Faerie Tales, #1)",0689867042,Holly Black,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Fantasy_Queen,"I love this book. This book is the best Faerie book I have ever read. It has great characters, plots, etc. Very edgy and dark. Excellently written. If you are not a person to enjoy a book with drug use, sex, graphic description, and or plain dark novels/series, then dont read it.Other than that, its an awsome read. No doubt about it."
"Tithe (Modern Faerie Tales, #1)",0689867042,Holly Black,Barnes and Noble,4.3,SavyLeArtist,"I love Holly Black for her ""Spiderwick Chronicals.""  So when I picked up Tithe, I thought, ""Cool!  Holly Black, faries, teenager's level, it can't get any better!""  But I had to put the book down and give it away within the first ten pages.  I can understand that for some adult writters to write for teenagers today, but it feels like Holly Black is trying way to hard.  It also felt like Black was trying to use every curse word in her memory banks within the first chapter.  Does she think all teens are over sexed, bad mouthed hoolagins?

If your looking for 'edge', maybe you'll like this book.  But if you want a good story, with substance, read ""Graceling""."
"Tithe (Modern Faerie Tales, #1)",0689867042,Holly Black,Barnes and Noble,4.3,3monstersmom,"It's amazing what you can find in the young adult section of your favorite book store. Normally I try to avoid this section. I find the books unsatisfying and the characters dripping with morals and ethics that are usually to adult based. For many young adult fiction writers, their characters seem to be wallowing in the 50's ideology and naivety. I know it's been a while since I was in high school, but I seriously doubt the Cleavers or the Brady's took over while I was gone. Hell yes teenagers smoke, drink, party, steal, skip or dropout of school, some are gay, some do drugs, and many even have sex. Why try to portray it differently, no matter what fantasy is playing out in a novel. Thus what I enjoyed most about Tithe was it's characters believable personalities.

Tithe is a beautifully crafted tale of 16 year old Kaye who has had a difficult life with nomad rocker mom Ellen. Kaye has always been a bit different, from the strange things that happen around her, to her ability to see and converse with faeries. Forced to move back into her hometown, Kaye reunites with her old friends both human and faerie, stumbles across Roiben, the handsome and mysterious Unseelie Knight, and discovers a secret that reveals her true nature. Now Kaye will need all the strength and clever wit she posses if she wishes to save her friends and herself.

I must say that Tithe is a beautifully dark, wondrous story that will captivate readers of any age. My only complaint being that the book is to short! I didn't want to leave the world of the faeries, and I am looking forward to reading Holly Black's next two books in the series. Tithe is a story to be put in the must read pile."
"Echo Burning (Jack Reacher, #5)",0515133310,Lee Child,Barnes and Noble,4,CassieNY,"I haven't read these books in any given order and I don't think it matters since the plots don't carry over or leave one hanging.  That's a gripe I have with other of series.  I've read about five of the Reacher novels and each time I have a hard time putting the guy away.  I want to read another and another just to be around him ... so to speak.  He's a unique character - a drifter I can admire.  Echo Burning is about a young, possibly battered married woman in trouble in a small town where the law may as well not exist until she finds Jack Reacher hitch-hiking as usual away to ""anywhere"".  One is quickly led all over Texas from one interesting character to another until the mystery is solved.  I can usually figure out who-done-it before the end of a novel but not these.  It's always a surprise.  Reacher never does what the reader has come to expect from these types of novels.  He doesn't sleep with her just to get some.  His language is clean - he's obviously educated, even refined in his own way.  An ex-military cop, Reacher has the moves that take out the bad guys fast.  He describes what he looks for and what to avoid.  It's interesting to see how he ""reads"" people and it's all so true-to-life. Warning: don't start reading just before bed-time!"
"Echo Burning (Jack Reacher, #5)",0515133310,Lee Child,Barnes and Noble,4,christytilleryfrench,"Jack Reacher travels the country with the clothes on his back and a folding toothbrush in his pocket. Hitchhiking through Texas, he's picked up by Carmen Greer, a beautiful Hispanic woman. Although Carmen's husband Sloop Greer is from a rich family, she only has $1.00 in her purse. Her husband's in prison and Carmen hopes he stays there but  Sloop's worked out a deal with the federal authorities and is expected home. Carmen's been cruising the streets, looking for someone she can talk into murdering her husband because he physically abused her before he went to prison and she's afraid he'll kill her once free. Reacher agrees to go with Carmen to Sloop's ranch to protect her but tells her he will not commit murder. Just hours after Sloop's home, he's found in his bedroom, shot to death by Carmen's gun. Carmen's arrested and Reacher teams up with a lawyer from the legal mission to find out who really shot Sloop Greer.

Reacher is one of the best characters written today; a strong man who is comfortable with himself and his own personal scruples. He's a cultured man with intelligence who lives a nomadic, asocial lifestyle and can be brutal without remorse if he feels it's deserved. In Echo Burning, there are plots and subplots which Child ties together nicely, providing a boatload of suspense along the way."
"Echo Burning (Jack Reacher, #5)",0515133310,Lee Child,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,Not my most favorite Jack Reacher Book. Thought it lacked the usual excitement and plot was so much like others.
"The Fury / Dark Reunion (The Vampire Diaries, #3-4)",0061140988,L.J. Smith,Barnes and Noble,4.3,twilightfan201,It was pretty awesome if I have to say.  There was lots of twist and turns that is what I liked the most about this book and the series things just fly in your face and you didn't know what was happening it was a pretty good read.  Its a good reread too.  If you like vampire books you should get this one.  And it is so romatic too. lol

He does not want to be by bella but he draws her closer all the time.  Bella had absolutly no reaction to Edward.  Stefan and Elena are ment to be together forever EVEN WHEN DEATH SEPERATES THEM!!!  The hatered between Stefan and Damon is incredably AWSOME!!!  The vampire diaries is 20 TIMES BETTER THEN THE TWILIGHT SERIES!!!  THERE IS MORE ACTION LESS LOVEY DOVEY STUFF AND THE EMOTION IN THIS BOOK HAS ME CRYING EVEN AFTER THE 3rd time reading it.  THE TWILIGHT SERIES HAS NOTHING ON THE VAMPIRE DIARIES!!!!
Into the Darkest Corner,0062197266,Elizabeth Haynes,Barnes and Noble,4.4,nfmgirl,"Catherine Bailey, like all of us, has a past. However her past has drastically scarred her, leaving her crippled with obsessions and compulsions and avoidance issues. The doctors call it by simple little acronyms like ""OCD"" and ""PTSD"". I think Catherine would simply call it ""life shattering"". Several years ago, she had a violent and obsessive boyfriend, leaving her paranoid and always looking over her shoulder, never trusting her surroundings.

Stuart is the upstairs neighbor. Being a therapist, he seems to see beyond all of the compulsions to the woman that lies beneath, and he is drawn to the woman she was and he knows she can be again.

I found this gritty and emotional story quite fascinating. When looking at Catherine ""today"", you see a broken woman, weak, out-of-control, totally irrational in her behavior. Yet the way that the book is written, shifting quickly from the past to the present and back again, you get to slowly walk through her past relationship, watching it build little-by-little. As you do, you find that the present-day actions and behaviors that previously seemed irrational begin to make total sense. She isn't crazy at all. Her obsessive behaviors seem almost ""right"" in light of the past.

A note of warning: This book can be quite graphic, violent and vulgar. But it is real, believable, and not exploitative.

My final word: Guttural, this story reaches deep within, leaving you a little uneasy as you think perhaps ""There but by the grace of God go I."" How a person can enter your life so innocuously and damage it so irreparably. How you could be taken from a strong and powerful woman, and left shattered and fearful. And mixed in amidst the twisted fears and terror is a touching romantic story. Frightening but intriguing and, in the end, utterly fascinating."
Into the Darkest Corner,0062197266,Elizabeth Haynes,Barnes and Noble,4.4,BookSakeBlogspot,"If you&rsquo;ve ever wondered what it&rsquo;s like to have an obsessive compulsive disorder, this book will show you a view into that world. The author definitely did her research and had great reasoning&rsquo;s behind why Cathy does the things she does. Her compulsions are so believable that I couldn&rsquo;t imagine a world where she didn&rsquo;t do these things.

At the start of the book I was confused as to what was going on as each chapter moves back and forth in time. With the name change from Catherine (in the past) to Cathy (in the future) I didn&rsquo;t catch that they were the same person for awhile. Maybe if I had read the synopsis of the book more recently I would have known that, but because I read a digital edition I didn&rsquo;t have that handy, and I like to be surprised when I&rsquo;m reading.

When I was getting close to the end I was hoping and hoping that the author wouldn&rsquo;t take the easy way out &ndash; and she didn&rsquo;t, so I was totally pleased. There are a number of hard to read parts to the book &ndash; the abuse Catherine suffers is torturous, but reading it is well worth getting into her mind and feelings.

This book is 611 pages long, but so easy to read, it flew by without me knowing how long it really way. (I honestly just saw the page count as I was typing the review.) Haynes is an author I will keep an eye on!

"Naked Empire (Sword of Truth, #8)",0765344300,Terry Goodkind,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"Very disappointing, 400 pages of the book are just recaps of the previous books in the series. The characters are constantly stopping the action to explain their actions based on recaps of other books in the series. Several characters seem to have no purpose other than to recap the prior books. The heavy hand of an editor who wanted to make the book stand by itself (without the reader having read the prior books in the series) is quite evident. You usually see this when a writer changes publishers. I've already purchased 'Chainfire', but haven't started it yet, but if it takes 300 to 400 pages to get the story moving this may be the end my purchasing Terry Goodkind novels."
"Naked Empire (Sword of Truth, #8)",0765344300,Terry Goodkind,Barnes and Noble,4.1,BolivarJ,"In the Eight installment of The Sword of Truth, Goodkind takes readers to the Bandakaran Empire, a place pass up through the mountains, to the East from The Pillars of Creation.
Goodkind's ""Naked Empire""  is the follow up to "" Pillars of Creation"" a must read for those unanswered questions. While the previous installment dealt with those pristinely ungifted people, descendants of the  house of Rahl, ""Naked Empire"" details the genesis of those "" Banished""  who were victims of fate. While not being strange to readers, the ongoing war between Emperor Jagang and Lord Rahl,  has been explored from both sides. In this installment, However; the author aims at the Imperial Order's vicious ideology, the real force behind the conflict between both worlds.

In ""Naked Empire"" Goodkind  explores the world before Richard and Kahlan, and the pristinely ungifted people of Bandakar, the great attempt to alter the very nature of mankind. For beyond is evil: Those who cannot see.

While Jagang has managed to capture the Wizard's Keep, and along with the Sisters of the Dark being able to construct those human weapons from the ancient war, Richard has been poisoned, meanwhile, his gift has mysteriously started to decay.

""Naked Empire"" is the colossal return of Goodkind to the foundations of a new kind of people, to the Pillars of Creation. Goodkind's creative writing succeeds again. Taken from the ancient book ""The Pillars of Creation"", and an Empire built by Kaja-Rang, a Wizard from the times of the great war. Goodkind's imagination, and spellbinding world prevails again. The story of Kahlan and Richard continues, In the eight installment,  The sword of truth becomes difficult to resist.

The author takes  readers back to  Aydindril, Home of the Confessors, and the Wizard's Keep, The people's palace,and to an unknown world known as the Bandakar Empire. In a spellbinding world surrounded by Wizards, Mord-siths, prophets, the sisters of the Dark, the ungifted descendants of the House of Rahl, Slides, and Betty the Goat."
"Naked Empire (Sword of Truth, #8)",0765344300,Terry Goodkind,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,The last 100 pages of this book are all that's worth reading.  Goodkind bores us with too much babbling.  Not much of this book contributes to moving along the general themes and goals of the series. You're okay to skip much of this book without losing vital information.
"Map of Bones (Sigma Force, #2)",0060765240,James Rollins,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"Excellent book! Rollins comes at you with a dizzying pace and almost overwhelming information. After 20 pages you adjust to his speed and data ... and you enjoy the ride! This is a modern thriller with obvious comparisons to The DaVinci Code. Three American intelligence operatives and two Italians (priest and niece) form an unlikely and tight partnership to thwart an ancient religious order from gaining an ultimate prize. Perhaps this is a perceptive view of our 21st century, a harmonious blend of science and spirituality, history and technology, religion and government agents across borders. A high point is Rollins' use of a loyal team of five very diverse people devoted to one another and their mission. This is a fine read!"
"Map of Bones (Sigma Force, #2)",0060765240,James Rollins,Barnes and Noble,4.2,TaylaurErin,"James Rollins is one of my new favorite thriller authors, among the ranks of Michael Crichton, Dan Brown, Douglas Preston, and Lincoln Child. His plots are thrilling and incredibly unique leaving you in suspense and utterly surprised by the twists and turns. The first of his ""Sigma Force"" series, Map of Bones, is by far one of his best works yet and definitely one of my favorites from this series. Grayson Pierce is an interesting James Bond-esq lead character with whom you instantly fall in love and wish you were more like. His historical references as well as theological and mythological foundation are incredibly intriguing, making outside research on the topics fun and useful. Map of Bones is easily comparable to The Davinci Code, as the setting and religious elements are very similar. However, Rollins' writing style as well as the more thrilling theme makes it, in my opinion, a superior novel. Possibly one of my top ten favorite thrillers, Map of Bones is a must read for any action lover or someone looking for a new interesting author."
"Map of Bones (Sigma Force, #2)",0060765240,James Rollins,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"James Rollins has always been one of my favorite action/thriller writers, but he seems to have drifted in his last two books, gravitating toward the Matt Reilly-type thriller with lots of shootouts and narrow escapes, and less of the creative bent that characterized such efforts as Amazonia and Subterranean. The plot of 'Map of Bones' has  a touch of 'Da-Vinci Code', with Biblical relics pivotal to the plot. Overall, it's a fun, fast-paced read, but wait for the paperback or get it from the library."

As each girl begins to remember their past friendship with Ali, each slowly realizes that Ali just wasn't the sweet, innocent girl everyone loved. Ali kept secrets of her own. . . secrets that could have killed her.I figured out ""A's"" identity after reading book 2: Flawless, however after reading the last chapter in Unbelievable, I just can't help but to wonder is there more to ""A"" and these four former best friends.

"Unbelievable (Pretty Little Liars, #4)",0060887397,Sara Shepard,Barnes and Noble,4.6,XXXOOOBookwormOOOXXX,"The now not so fab four have all new problems on their hands. Emily has been sent out to the country, only to find that her problems will follow her wherever she goes. Hanna's still in a coma, but will she still remember A's identity when she wakes up? Aria's trying to piece not only her life together, but also the pieces to the enigma that is A. Meanwhile Spencer still hasn't learned her lessons about cheating or forbidden fruit- lucky for her, A is an ever patient tutor in those matters. This is an amazing bone chilling suspensefull novel. It was hard to put down and I just loved it. Romance and action all in one amazing series. If u want to read this you better have time on your hands because you just can't put it down. I wish I could say I didn't see it coming, but I can't. I did enjoy the ending of this book, however. Some stuff is still left in the dark so the series could continue, but for the most part, everything is out in the open and explained. A got pretty sloppy in this book. I think there was also a lack of good ideas on the author's part. Is it just me or are these books better when Ali isn't mentioned in every chapter?"
"Unbelievable (Pretty Little Liars, #4)",0060887397,Sara Shepard,Barnes and Noble,4.6,TeensReadToo,"Spencer, Hanna, Aria, and Emily are back, some in a better state than others, and ready to bring down A. When we last left the pristine Rosewood, Hanna had just discovered who A was, but she knew too much and A made sure she couldn't say anything by ""accidentally"" hitting her with a car. Now, as Hanna fights for her life, the other three girls have to clean up the mess that A has made. Spencer finally remembers what happened the night of Ali's death and what she remembers isn't good. Could she really have killed Ali? Not only does she have to deal with the thought that she could have really killed her best friend, but she's got to reason with the guilt of stealing her sister's AP Economics paper, which got Spencer nominated for an award her sister should have won. With the feeling that A is constantly breathing down her back, will Spencer be able to keep her cool composure, or will she finally pop? After A let it leak that Emily likes girls, Emily's been living on the edge of sanity. Her parents don't know what to do with her, so they send her off to her ultra-conservative relatives in Middle of Nowhere, Iowa. When she arrives, Emily knows she won't last long -- then she meets Trista, an interesting girl who seems to understand Emily and doesn't mind talking to her. Will Emily last, or will she flee back to Rosewood and hope that she is accepted by those who love her most? Aria's been kicked out of her mother's house after her mom found out she had been keeping the fact of her father's affair a secret for the past three years. Once again, we have A to thank for unveiling this bit of information. With nowhere else to go, Aria moves in with her father and his horrifyingly peppy girlfriend, Meredith. All Aria wants is for her life to go back to normal. When she starts an art class over at the neighborhood college her partner is none other than Jenna Cavanaugh, the girl who was the terrible victim of a nasty prank that Aria was a part of. Can Aria ever escape her past or will it keep catching up with her? Then there's Hanna, who really is hanging on for dear life. She can't remember anything from the night of the accident, especially the identity of A. The rest of the group doesn't want to pressure her too much, but they really want to know who A is. If this isn't enough, Hanna has to deal with her feelings for Lucas. She remembers hanging out with him a couple of times, but that's it. It seems, though, that a lot more happened. Will Hanna be able to get her memory back and solve the mystery of who A really is? PRETTY LITTLE LIARS has always been a favorite series of mine. I mean, who can resist the scandalous secrets of others, especially of those who live in Rosewood? UNBELIAVALBLE completely blew all three of the previous books out of the water. It could almost be a stand-alone book if all the information we learn in the preceding books wasn't crucial to the plot...Read the full review at www.teensreadtoo.com"
A Passage to India,014144116X,"E.M. Forster, Oliver Stallybrass, Pankaj Mishra",Barnes and Noble,3.2,Guest,"This book is a great example of how the injection of western influences and domination throw the equilbruim of societies into a state of disarray.  The europeans took over rule in many countries trying to force the native cultures into adopting their rules and laws.  The domination of western peoples also created its own class structures with them on top.  This initiated racism and a hierarchy of social classes.  The perceptions of the native peoples even caused them to turn on their own at times.  Due to their discontent from the structural conditions of the subjunation of their culture by the British, the Indians used the incident this book centers around to spark a rebellion against western intervention on their way of life.  The clashing of cultures due to the integration of western ideologies with the basic belief systems of India caused immense stress on the native people of India.  A must for anyone studying the emergence of western ideals in other non-western nations."

A Passage to India,014144116X,"E.M. Forster, Oliver Stallybrass, Pankaj Mishra",Barnes and Noble,3.2,Guest,"This novel, is not one to criticize and detest to the utmost degree...but more a book that has tremendous potential. I had to do a project on this one, and as much as some parts 'did drag on' it was an interesting read. You definitly get a first hand look at the racial tensions that go on between the British and the Indians.  You see different religious perspectives from muslims, christians, and hindus. You get to experience something a bit different.  The language really wasn't that confusing. If you had background knowledge upon British India it might have helped a bit more...but really, it wasn't that bad.  The characters were all very well developed and you begin to sense the conflicting view points among all the characters.  The characters are not flawless, but very believable.      All in all...it has tremedous potential...the symbols, setting, and plot show that human nature no matter how sweet it intends to be...always has its drawbacks due to social pressures and such.    good book...though it seems people usually tend to expect more."

He has really ruined these books for me (as far as listening to them). I recomend that you read the book rather than listen to it in audiobook.  I also have friends at work that would agree with me.  I love audiobooks, not much of an actual reader, so when I say ""read the book, don't listen"" the reader must be really really horrible and Dick Hill is."

"The Mammoth Hunters (Earth's Children, #3)",0553381644,Jean M. Auel,Barnes and Noble,4.3,jansquared,"Great book for 3rd in Series.  Characters rich and well thought out by writer.  References to plant life/usage on the mark.  Animal descriptions as accurate as I've ever seen.  Geographical/topical detail in minutae. Ms Auel is often redundant with prior story background and descriptions of locals and plantlife, but above all the reading is still great.  This series of books would make a great collection for a personal library so it could be read again and/or shared with others."
"The Mammoth Hunters (Earth's Children, #3)",0553381644,Jean M. Auel,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,You definately need to read Clan of the Cave Bear and Valley of the Horses first.

I found myself literally skipping over multitude of pages. It is like the author was looking for ""filler"" to 'make' a book. The descriptions of the environment, the animals, the feelings, the plants, the flint carving, everything went too far. Drama drama drama. I didn't like it much but had already paid for it, so I skimmed it. Don't spend money on it; go to a library and check it out for free."

This book has it all: action, adventure, intruge, the whole nine yards, it keeps you attention so well you will wonder where the time has gone.Like in all of his books, Butcher uses the same underling storyline that has been constant in the series mixed with new struggles confrontations that keep the story line fresh after so many novels. With these new problems there are resolutions that add to the building of the story underneath which gives the reader a sense of completion at the end of the book while making him beg for more.Overall a great story and something that should be included in aany reader's collection.Have a Merry Christmas"

Quite a lot of politicking/ succession pieces seemed occasionally to pad it out so a few of the storyline pieces felt unusually sparse (Iceman storyline felt quickly over with). It looks like the last book will have an almighty fight with the Vord that I'm looking forward to loads. It felt a little like the ""Empire Strikes Back"" with the Vord finishing with very solidly ahead. Quite a lot of major story still to clear up in the next ones though so I hope I can wait out for book 6 to get into paperback."
Chrysanthemum,0688147321,Kevin Henkes,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Elena Anderson,I love this book I must have read it a hundred times! It is a great book and very amusing for children.
Chrysanthemum,0688147321,Kevin Henkes,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Tracy Thomas,Even my six year old son liked this book. It a nice example on how sometimes kids can be mean and how it doesn't take much to change their minds!
Chrysanthemum,0688147321,Kevin Henkes,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"This was my ABSOLUTE favorite book when I was a kid.  I read it over and over.  I HIGHLY recommend getting this for your child, and if you are a child, READ IT!  It's sooo cute & entertaining, but also, I think it teaches a pretty good lesson."
"Sweet Evil (Sweet, #1)",0062085611,Wendy Higgins,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Alaiel_Kreuz,"From the beginning when I found the blurb of the book in Goodreads I thought &quot;Hey, this book looks totally awesome. I'm gonna have to read it!&quot; And then I pre-ordered it right away. Reasons? Well, first we have the cover. Have you seen it?! Her red dress is gorgeous, she is a beauty all by herself but surrounded by that wicked forest and the cool shadow of that totally hot guy while the whole covers exudes this &quot;embrace-me right-now-and-surrender&quot; vibe is just too much.

Second reason: The blurb. Maybe this will sound weird but I've always being told I'm some sort of bad influence. Why? No clue. I mean, I'm the personification of cuteness and sweetness and all that... Yeah, right. I'm not fooling you, am I? Thanks to the first line of the summary I had an overwhelming desire to read this book about teenagers that had to be a bad influence in order to stay alive.

And then I finally got to read the book. True to be told I have mixed feelings. You see, Anna's personality at the beginning is just so... so... good (deep sigh). I know it's not bad to be good but then again, an utterly good person can get on your nerves, right? At least she did get on mine. But don't get me wrong, once you understand the deepness of her struggles the entire book develops a new layer of intrigue.

The way Anna interacts with the other sons and daughters of the Dukes make a huge difference in her life. Where once her only friend had being Jay (a human boy that is like a brother for her) now she had to learn to deal with the Twins, Marna and Ginger, daughters of the Duke of Adultery whose purpose was to break couples that truly loved each other; Blake, son of the Duke of Envy; Kopano, son of the Duke of Wrath, that has his own story and whom I like a lot; and finally Kaidan, son of the Duke of Lust, the target of Anna's affection.
All of them had to work for their fathers' cause. Or face the consequences; and let me tell you, we are talking of horrible consequences here.

Thanks to this new situation we see Anna fight and then embrace, somehow, her destiny. But how can see truly turn to evil when there's good inside of her?

Personal opinion:
Right now, if I could, I would love to read the second book. The way Wendy describes the scenes was superb, and this is a debut novel, people. During the first chapters I thought this book was going to be very suave, you know? But Wendy just blew my mind when some scenes were described with complete honesty making very easy to separate good from evil. Some paragraphs were a little too strong maybe but in the right amount. You will cringe but you won't cry; you will just understand what the characters are going through and that's a huge plus.

So yes, buy it and read it in one sit. You won't be disappointed."
"Sweet Evil (Sweet, #1)",0062085611,Wendy Higgins,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Anonymous,"This book was great! Great story very original. Ive been losing my mind with all the vampire and werewolf books out right now. I mean I love them but you can only put so many new twists to them, and they end up kind of the same in all books. So this book was awesome a whole new original story havent read anything like it yet. The way the characters interact with eacother is great, in most books you dont see the rrlationships between all the characters with eachother. In this book you do, it makes you love each one more. 

SPOILER ALERT!!
Does it piss off anyone else that Kaiden cant just suck it up and admitt his feelings? I mean freakin Kope knows her for like a couple days, barely talks to her, and he clearly makes his feelings known! I hope she gets over Kaiden more in the next book but at the same time I hope they get together! But right now i just want to punch Kaiden! Yeah im crazy i know."

"The Winds of War (The Henry Family, #1)",0316952664,Herman Wouk,Barnes and Noble,4.4,jlv1634,"What a remarkable story. I read both the Winds of War and War and Remembrance. It was just fascinating. I didn't want it to end. You get lost in the story of the Henry family as they traverse all the events of WWII. There is romantic tension, adventure, thrills and more. The vivid descriptions of the concentration camps and what happened there made my hair stand up and saddened me very much. There was also a tremendous amount of factual information of real events that happened in WWII. So in that sense it was very educational. It was reminiscent of Ken Follett's Pillars of the Earth and World without End in the way that it grabbed you and sucked you in to the story. I highly recommend both of these novels."
"The Winds of War (The Henry Family, #1)",0316952664,Herman Wouk,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"Mr. Baker, the ''history fan who was bilked,'' must have been reading a different book. While ''The Winds of War'' certainly has its fair share of romantic plotlines, to claim that's all there is, and to refer to the analytical history sections as ''a few instances'' is to do this modern classic an enormous disservice. Herman Wouk has written the American equivalent of Tolstoy's epic ''War and Peace.'' Using the Henry and Jastrow families as a means to introduce his readers to broad subjects -- like the geopolitical situation on the eve of World War II, the battle tactics of the armies, and the cruelty of Nazi treatment of the Jews, which eventually morphed into the horrors of the Holocaust -- is positively ingenious. The segments of the book 'written' by the fictional German general Armin von Roon are perhaps Wouk's most incredible achievement in the novel, as he seamlessly slips into the voice of the opposing side. A definite must-read."
"The Winds of War (The Henry Family, #1)",0316952664,Herman Wouk,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"I have read both books over 50 times, I have actually worn out two sets of paperbacks and bought a third in addition to having it downloaded onto my e-book reader. Wouk not only provides an excellent account of the history but details which characters were real and which were part of his fiction. My high school aged daughter read this (a few years ago) and learned more facts and truth about WWII the she had in 4 years of 'history'. My Dad (a WW II vet) read it and really enjoyed it. I bought the entire TV miniseries on DVDs for both Winds of War and War and Rememberence."
"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Stories, #1)",0060887184,Bernard Cornwell,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"If you are into the chaotic history after the fall of the Roman Empire, then this book will be hard for you to put down! Cornwell does a superb job of opening this brutal world to us! Before there were chivalric codes, before the modern-day countries even existed, there were people fighting to gain territory formerly held by the Romans. This included the Danes/Vikings who were in their 'golden age' during the Dark Ages. The central characters in this book are tough in a harsh world, and you get to know them as they struggle. It makes you want more! About halfway through this book, I hopped online to buy the rest of the series. I didn't want to have to wait before reading the other books. Cornwell is definitely on my short list of great authors."
"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Stories, #1)",0060887184,Bernard Cornwell,Barnes and Noble,4.2,SuperBookish,Wonderful Book I enjoyed reading. kept me entertained all the way through.
"The Last Kingdom (The Saxon Stories, #1)",0060887184,Bernard Cornwell,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"After reading all of Sharon Kay Penman's historical fiction (which are all excellent reads as well), I realized I didn't know very much about early England and found Bernard Cornwell's ""The Last Kingdom"" in a google search for this specific time period.  Cornwell's description of the shield wall, battle strategies, the cunning of the Danes and King Alfred, training of warriers - all brought to life - and one can't help but thoroughly enjoy Uhtred's character.  One forgets that Christianity was growing and still had not been accepted in so may parts of Europe, that the history of the Danes' gods and their belief background at the time was very interesting.  History merely touches on these things so if you want to delve deeper, Cornwell brings all of this to life in this wonderful novel.  I'm anxious to finish the trilogy....I simply could not put this book down.  Most certainly recommended reading."

"Ascend (Trylle, #3)",1250006333,Amanda Hocking,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"I'm pretty much speechless regarding this book. After reading the 1st two books my skin was itching because I had to wait for the ending of the storyline. Finally it was here and I was so disappointed with the story and the plot that I couldn't even finish. I basically just skimmed thru my nook to try and find some key points ***SPOILER*** and stopped right after reading that Wendy finally slept with someone, only to see it was Loki!!! Seriously?!?! She went from not being able to have just one night w/ her 'true love' or cheating on her fiance/husband to sleeping w/ a guy she really doesn't know except besides a flirtatious relationship. Occasionally they have those deep one on one convo's about how their families but he always just seemed to be so devious. IDK, the story just took a turn so quick and out of the blue with no explanation. If Wendy wasn't the main character the lack of explanation and detail wouldn't matter, but since she is I would like to know and I would like to know why not Finn?!?! Her and Finn had something special which was built upon non stop throughout every single book. And maybe if she didn't become so into the politics of being Queen I could understand who resentment towards him for choosing duty and the people, but she ended up doing the same thing.. Just makes no sense and I really hated Loki. He was just so cocky and condescending and it felt like he was always putting on a show of some sort. IDK, this book just seemed completely out of place from the first two. Maybe either a lot of the story needed to be cut out for publishing purposes or the author was just bored with the story itself... Maybe Finn reminded her of an ex and she was infuriated at his memory so she decided to cancel Finn from the equation lol... IDK but whatever it was it just butchered the entire story and made me unable to read the whole thing. I stopped once Wendy made the trade w/ the king and they were driving home.... I can't believe how disappointed I was... Finn was such a huge part in the series and then nothing, he was just looked upon. UGH, I hate how stories can make you react so strongly, as if the story somehow affected you personally... Hahaha... Oh well, at least there was 2 out of 3."
"Ascend (Trylle, #3)",1250006333,Amanda Hocking,Barnes and Noble,4.3,tigresslilly,"I really liked this closer to the Wendy/Troll trilogy.  I think Wendy remains likable, real, and in character with her previous incarnations.  The plot continues to be fast paced and high drama.  If you liked Twilight, and fantasy romance novels then this is really up your ally.  

**Spoilers to come**  In response to a few people who seem confused by Wendy's choice in men, I'm genuinely curious to know if you missed the whole part where she gave up on Finn and where Finn willingly walked away from her time and time again.  She offered to fight for the relationship on many occasions and Finn rebuffed her.  He never wanted anything more than a few stolen kisses and he always wanted to feel bad about those kisses and to have Wendy feel bad about them too.  What is attractive or desirable about a man who wants you to feel bad for wanting him?  Meanwhile Loki presses forward in courting Wendy without shame.  He considers her feelings and needs but still expresses his own view and desire.  He abandons his place in the world and the world order he knows specifically to be with Wendy.  It might not be enough to base a marriage on (as Wendy and Loki choose to), but it's way more flattering/romantic than Finn's stance.  Also I like that Wendy doesn't just cling senselessly to the first man she meets, the whole notion seems so last generation to me.

I don't judge Wendy for her infidelity in her marriage.  The choice of who to marry wasn't really entirely free on her part and I don't think she should be shackled to sleeping with a man she doesn't love or really know because he was a good business deal.  I do think she should have had an open and frank discussion with him about what kind of fidelity if any she owed him, but her first time with Loki was in the middle of an emotional whirlwind with her people being slaughtered, her lands in ruins, and the man who promised to back and support her forever having just assaulted her--it's a lot for a person to deal with is all I'm saying."
"The Keeper of Lost Causes (Department Q, #1)",0525952489,"Jussi Adler-Olsen, Lisa Hartford",Barnes and Noble,4.2,ethel55,"Detective Carl Morck reports back to work after being injured on the job. One partner died, the other hospitalized indefinitely.  Carl is a flawed character, seemingly difficult to work with, so he is assigned to a new unit, Department Q.  Relegated to the basement, assigned as an assistant an old Syrian, Assad, who won't leave the department alone, Carl passes time making piles of cold case folders.  Eventually required to report something upstairs, Carl touches on the Merete Lynngaard disappearance and with Assad strangely helpful, Carl delves into the five year old mystery.  I look forward to more books about Department Q and Carl Morck.  I can only hope Adler-Olsen has already written them, the quicker to be translated and released on the American market."
"The Keeper of Lost Causes (Department Q, #1)",0525952489,"Jussi Adler-Olsen, Lisa Hartford",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"Received ARC from Net Galley.  A bit slow getting started (about 60 pgs) but definitely picked up and well worth the time.  Inspector Carl Morck gets assigned to the newly formed Q Department (reminded me of Peter Benchley's Q Clearance).  He's been assigned the old, unsolved cases and an assistant, Assad.  The first case they re-open involves the suicide (was it??) of a goverment official (jumped from a ferry boat...or did she).  Narratives switches back and forth from 2002 (when the 'suicide' took place) to 2007 when Carl re-opens the case.  The villian's character is well developed and the tension steadily builds.  Evolved into a real page turner.  Great book by another (of many) accomplished and highly entertaining Scandanavian authors."
"The Keeper of Lost Causes (Department Q, #1)",0525952489,"Jussi Adler-Olsen, Lisa Hartford",Barnes and Noble,4.2,TWTaz,"I really enjoyed this book and the characters of detective Carl Mork and his assistant Assad in Department Q. The story drew me in from the beginning. There were a few spots in the book that were a little too slow paced for my liking, but it didn't detract from the overall tension for me of whether Carl would solve the mystery before it was too late for the victim. I also found myself laughing quite a bit throughout at Carl's opinion of some of his co-workers and at some of Assad's antics. I so wish everyone would stop comparing every book to The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo trilogy. Yes, I really liked all three books in that series. But in my opinion, this story was in no way, shape or form anything like Stieg Larsson's books, which I'm grateful for. If I want to read the same storyline over and over I'll just go back to those books and re-read them. The Keeper of Lost Causes was a great story with great characters that kept my interest throughout. I really hope the translation of the next book in the Department Q series hits the USA soon. I will definitely spend my money on that one as well."
Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain,0676979785,Oliver Sacks,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Ryan_Shewcraft,"Sacks relays some very interesting stories of the strange neurological cases that he has come across in his practice.  The disorders sound like they were pulled straight from a science fiction book.  It was a delight to read about the many tricks that the mind can play on our perceptions.However, I was hoping for a bit more technical explanation as to why these disorder occur.  I am unsure if much of this was left out because the book was meant for a general audience or if the reason is that it is not yet understood.  Lacking this technical aspect, I have to admit that I eventually dulled to the novelty of the stories and found myself getting slightly bored in the second half of the book.  Nonetheless, the stories are told with genuine interest and passion, making for a both interesting and enlightening read."
Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain,0676979785,Oliver Sacks,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Anonymous,Musicophilia is a great book that really helps me because I am a singer with autism. I read some stories in the book that captivates for the musically active person in anyone. This is really helpful
Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain,0676979785,Oliver Sacks,Barnes and Noble,3.8,MoriartyM,"Musicophilia is not a single story, but a collection of different short stories about music and the brain. The tales range from experiences we commonly have, such as songs stuck in our heads, to other less known conditions such as musical hallucinations. Oliver Sacks is not only an author, but a professor of neurology at the New York University School of Medicine as well. His expertise allows for professional input that ties the book together. The overarching message that music is a uniquely human trait is apparent throughout the book. 




The organization of the book is excellent. Each chapter has a several stories that all revolve around a common theme such as absolute pitch or synesthesia. The stories are dissimilar enough to maintain interest rather than repeat each other, yet they all demonstrate his point. The main thing I like about this book is I can make several connections to it even though I've never been struck by lightning followed by a sudden case of musical genius or had an epileptic fit over music. Instead of only considering rare cases of music and the brain, Sacks also included cases involving songs that get stuck in your head, times when music just becomes a bunch of indiscernible noises, and the emotions that come along with playing or listening to music. Perhaps, I enjoyed this book because music has played such a large part in my life.




While I appreciated that the book was relatively easy to understand, there could have been a deeper analysis. Sacks usually switched topics before the analysis could get too far. That being said, you don't need a background of psychology, neurology, nor music to understand this book. There are few words such as &ldquo;magnetoencephalography&rdquo; that might trip you up. However, taking anatomy did a fine job with preparing me to break down these kind of words. That was probably the longest word in the book anyways.




If you have any interest in music and how it affects you on the level of your brain, then by all means, read this book. It's interesting to say the least and will provide excellent topics of conversation if nothing else. I would recommend other books by Oliver Sacks such as An Anthropologist on Mars, Seeing Voices, or  The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat. These books are also collections of stories of people with different neurological disorders. Some of the stories from these books briefly appeared in Musicophilia."

Fool,0060590319,Christopher Moore,Barnes and Noble,4.2,harstan,"In 1288, King Lear of Britain decides to divide his kingdom into three monarchies run by each of his daughters.  Who inherits what will be determined by Lear based on whom he perceives loves him the most.  His best friend and most loyal subject the Earl of Kent warns him he is acting the fool with this proposition; for his honesty he is exiled from the nation.His eldest daughters Goneril and Regan constantly flatter him and tell him how much each loves him; their ducal spouses also go out of their way to cajole their father-in-law.  His youngest child unmarried with suitors Princess Cordelia refuses to sweet-talk her dad with blatant lies; instead she is honest and sincere with him refusing to exaggerate her love.  Irate with Cordelia, Lear leaves her nothing; instead he splits the kingdom between Goneril and Regan.  However, as King Lear descends into madness, his decision leads to murder and war.Paying homage in a cheeky way to the Bard, Christopher Moore¿s take on the classic King Lear play is a brilliant mix of bawdry bedroom-bathroom comedy with a tragic novel in five acts.  The story is told by the one person who knows everything that is going on because as the FOOL everyone except the apprentice FOOL Drool assumes subconsciously that Pocket is too stupid to understand court intrigue by the royals and the retinue.  Well written and entertaining, Mr. Moore captures the essence of Lear in this fine rendition that is summed up by mentioning the rationale for having a ghost is simply ¿there¿s always a bloody ghost¿.Harriet Klausner"
Fool,0060590319,Christopher Moore,Barnes and Noble,4.2,LydHead,"Lear is not my favorite Shakespeare play, and I've only ever seen a few productions (haven't read it), so I went into this story kind of blindly.  About midway throught the book, I thought to myself that I'd like to read the play.  But then I skipped forward to the author's notes and realized that I really didn't need to.  
   Mr. Moore has taken the story of Lear and shifted the perspective of the reader so that we see the story through the minor player The Fool  (and what a vulgar fool!).  He is the Forrest Gump of the story, but whereas Gump stumbled through history unknowingly tangled in the strings of fate, Moore's fool manipulates those same strings like a master puppeteer.  
   Fool is extremely funny (the kind of book that causes the reader to receive strange looks from people because of the sudden bursts of laughter [yeah, I kind of worry my family sometimes]).  Maybe I will read the original afterall, then reread Fool."
Fool,0060590319,Christopher Moore,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Moore_Love_Than_Most,"For those of you familiar with Christopher Moores brand of humor, you're in for a treat. Gone are the foggy San Franscico street settings  of his previous novels, instead, you're a plunked into the world of King Lear, and just like ""Lamb"", previous departure from familiar characters, Moore adds his own brand of twisted humor to one of Shakespeares most devistating tragedies. While not as engaging as Lamb, or as formidible in scope, it's a satisfying read and one that will leave you laughing. Although the humor is much more scatalogical then his other books."
The Book of Lost Things,0743298853,John Connolly,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Janus,"Take Pan's Labyrinth and remove all the period-piece drama (so, basically the majority of the film), throw in a healthy dose of what The Brothers Grimm (yes, the Matt Damon and Heath Ledger film) COULD have been and you will have a vague concept of this amazing book. The most apt description I have heard for the Book of Lost Things so far is that it is a fairytale for grownups. The synopsis on the back gives you the setting, but please don't mistake that for the actual plot of the book. This story is about growing up and about loss. It is touching and creepy. Great characters, phenomenal prose and some excellent twists make The Book of Lost things as captivating a book as any reader can hope for."
The Book of Lost Things,0743298853,John Connolly,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"I am an avid reader of varied fiction and non-fiction and I have to say that the Book of Lost Things is one of the best books that I have read in a long time.  The author takes classic Grimm fairytales and turns them around to give the reader a new view of what they were brought up being told as a child.  The fairytales also help to advance the well-thought out plotline and give credence to many of the main characters decisions.  Although the book is based in fairy tales I would not reccomend it for children under the age of at least fifteen due to very graphic scenes and sexual allusions.  However, the book is phenomenal if read by the right age group and provides a unique perceptive on well-told tales.  This is a book I will read over and over again."

However, it's safe to say that Blood Work, so far, is my least favorite of Connelly's novels.  Not that it was bad, because on a suspense and mystery level, my interests were always piqued.  However, I found the character of McCaleb to be too much like Harry Bosch, even though Bosch is more developed because there are so much more books about him.

I'm glad I did. The story is cohesive with likable characters. The only drawback I have is the version I picked up is completely black and white, making some of the action and magic sequences hard to follow because of the overlap of lines and lack of dimension. This is a very long series, with 28 volumes (the last I checked) and I look forward to advancing the story. :)"

Even though I only have a passing familiarity with the Clamp characters this did not stop me from enjoying this very good fantasy/adventure story.  In this story the young princess, Sakura, is reveling in the fact that her best friend, Syaoran, has returned from an archeological dig.  Sakura is in love with Syaoran and is determined to share her feelings with him but before she can a hidden dimensional gate tears apart her spirit and Syaoran is charged with the task of traveling through the dimensions to put her together again.  Along the way he picks up two more traveling companions as well as a very happy, very cute little...thing...(umm, not sure what it is exactly). Another interesting aspect is that one of the scenes is a crossover into the manga xxxHolic (also by Clamp) which I am currently reading.  I really loved the romantic and humorous aspects of Tsubasa and look forward to reading more of this series in the future.  I'd certainly recommend this manga to ages 12 and up."

"The Demon King (Seven Realms, #1)",1423118235,Cinda Williams Chima,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"When I was looking at this book I wasn't sure.  Figured I'd start if and if I didn't like it could always take it back.  Was I WAY OFF on that presumption.  I started to read it and I couldn't put it down.  This story is written well, with courts, lords, guards and princes and princesses from other realms not to mention the street dwellers of the city.  I love the way Chima blends the Native Indians into this story - especially with courts and court life, very different but a great feel to the story.  It tells the story from 2 main characters prespectives:  Hanson Allister and Raisa ana Marianna.  You go through the events that are taking place in each of their lives which are on complete opposite ends of the spectrum that will mold them into what they will become.  Chima starts to slowly mesh the characters lives together.  The next story I believe will pull them together in ways that will surprise us all.

However, I did envision the cuffs that Han wears much larger then the ones that are shown on her website. I can't wait for the next book to come out.  Oh why do these writters do this do us - make us wait to find out what will happen.

This would be fantastic on the big screen.

Black Hole,037542380X,Charles Burns,Barnes and Noble,3.8,wandering_star on LibraryThing,"Before I started Black Hole, I knew that it was about a mysterious plague that affects teenagers. I suppose I was expecting strange occurrences and a sense of growing horror as people begin to realise what is happening. But in fact, when the book starts, the plague is already there: an established fact of life. The teenagers are just being teenagers - copping off with each other, getting stoned, trying to figure out what to do with their lives - with the plague as just another of the shadows that hangs over them.I found this quite difficult to read. Both the grotesqueness of the plague symptoms, and the awfulness of being a teenager, were made much more immediate and disturbing by the fact that they were depicted in images rather than words. (The style of the drawings, monochrome and usually with heavy black backgrounds, and the often grotesque dream sequences, add to the overall grimness - it's not one of those books that you start looking at and instantly want to read).That said, since finishing it, I have kept going back to look through it, and noticed new things. It is certainly a book with a lot of impact. This all sounds like faint praise. It's not meant to be: I think this is a good book. It's just that you need to know what you are getting into."

You get caught up into Zelda&rsquo;s lifestyle as she experiences the highs and lows of a complex relationship of love and hate. She was talented and misunderstood-a Southern belle merging from the na&iuml;ve protected girl to the struggles of power, success, fame, travel, alcoholism, infidelity, and mental illness and tough choices as she struggles for her own independence and self-worth.  Well done!"
Z: A Novel of Zelda Fitzgerald,1250028647,Therese Anne Fowler,Barnes and Noble,4.1,irishclaireKG,"This is an incredibly readable novel, one of the best I have read about Fitzgeralds.  As a university English professor, I have done a great deal of research on both Scott and Zelda, and the research here is  impeccable. What Fowler has also done, is write a wonderful readable novel.  The prose moves swiftly; no details are superfluous, repetitive or unnecessary.  I stayed up half the night finishing this.  What I also really appreciate is that Fowler tries to address several of the mythologized aspects of Zelda's life.  Read Fowler's ending notes and you will see how she explains using the vast amounts of research available on this couple--including their own letters--to try and present a rationale view of what happened during that tragic, turbulent relationship.  What emerges is Zelda as a sheltered, spoiled, na&iuml;ve young debutante, whisked away by the romantic notions presented to her by a mysterious, brash young man--a young man who offered her a way out of that safe and predictable existence she knew.  The fact her parents were dead-set against it only added to the allure.  To see this bright spirit crushed and distorted against her husbands' excessive ambition, immaturity, alcoholism and insecurities is tragic.  Zelda is a heartbreaking figure and Fowler does a beautiful job bringing her to light. One of the best books I've read this year, so far."

A Man Without a Country,081297736X,Kurt Vonnegut Jr.,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,This book sums up all of Vonnegut's thoughts from politics to the planet earth. It is very funny but very true at the same time. It is a quick read but will keep you thinking for a long while. If you havent read anything by Vonnegut you should pick this one up to see who the man realy is.

Within his writings of dark subjects, he manages to slide in his sense of humor.  This book has short stories about certain subjects of life, such as marriage, sex, war, and the environment.  But within these subjects are morals.  This is quick read with life meanings attached."

Frequent collaborator Maxine Paetro and Patterson spin another devilish and delightful addition to the WMC canon.All the Women make appearances: Lindsay Boxer is adjusting to life having her long-distance boyfriend now living in the same city (and often the same apartment); coroner Claire Washburn is very pregnant and up to her ever-expanding belly in victims of arson-murders; Yuki Castellano is prosecuting the confessed murderer of the former governor's son; and reporter Cindy Thomas continues to cement her status as a valued member of the Club.Conner Campion, born with a degenerative and incurable heart disease, has been a media and public darling his entire life, a la John F, Kennedy, Jr. When he suddenly disappears, the worst is feared, and an eventual tip leads to the last person to see him alive, a young hooker named Junie Moon. She makes a shocking and disturbing confession which she quickly recants, and Yuki is forced to prosecute this less than airtight case.Meanwhile, two young men who answer to the names Hawk and Pidge are tying up well-off couples and torching their homes_while the victims are still inside. The resulting conflagrations leave little useful evidence save one thing: a book, inscribed in Latin with cryptic sayings, is left at each scene.As with the previous titles in the series, the characters share equal importance with the mysteries they solve. The authors are in top form here, expounding believably on the now well-known lives of the WMC members, and Lindsay's new partner Rich Conklin makes a welcome_and compelling_return.Who are the menacing arsonists, whose trail of death leads literally to Lindsay's door? Can Yuki successfully convict a young murderess who is aided by a high-profile, media-savvy woman attorney? Will Lindsay finally say yes to Joe's proposal?

A Constellation of Vital Phenomena,0770436420,Anthony Marra,Barnes and Noble,4,Dragonette,"I started this book knowing very little of Chechnya.  Turns out I didn't need to know anything at all to appreciate this moving story of the human struggle to survive in an inhumane world. The author injects little bits of humor into the story that are unexpected considering the darkness of the wartime. He also has a charming habit of giving place, people and events both a forward and backward history almost as a counterpoint to the fact the the Soviets were trying their hardest to erase Chechnya' s history and make the country part of the Soviet machine.  I really loved this book and although you know that many of the characters are doomed to a gloomy end the joy is in getting to know them and their struggle to matter, to be counted, to be remembered. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to step outside of your own comfortable life for a moment and live in war torn eastern europe for a few hours.  You'll find yourself appreciating every small comfort of life that we are privileged to have."
A Constellation of Vital Phenomena,0770436420,Anthony Marra,Barnes and Noble,4,Nikki_F,"A Stunning Debut Novel.

Every once in a long while I come across a debut novel that is exceptionally spectacular; &ldquo;A constellation of Vital Phenomena&rdquo; by Anthony Marra is one of those novels.  It reminded me considerably of &ldquo;The Almond Tree&rdquo; by Michelle Cohen Corasanti, another brilliant debut.  Set in Chechnya between the years of 1994 and 2004, this novel follows the lives of the members of a small town and the family of a Russian surgeon.  

Marra&rsquo;s writing is beautiful and flawless.  His character development is absolutely perfect.  Each character is so remarkably human, in both their imperfections and their virtues.  The reader is immersed in the lives of these people, through every small joy and each horrible atrocity. 

Marra is a remarkable storyteller.  The numerous characters&rsquo; subplots are exceptionally and beautifully interwoven.  Each has touched another&rsquo;s life in a direct or indirect way.   This novel enlightens the readers of the struggles of their lives and relates every powerful emotion of a lifetime of uncertainty and struggle.

This book opened my eyes in a way few of us ever experience in the United States.  &ldquo;A Constellation of Vital Phenomena&rdquo; is captivating and demonstrative of the different ways humans choose to fight for survival in the face of injustice and war.  Marra does an exemplary job allowing the reader to see from multiple viewpoints of the same conflict.

This novel is life altering, thought provoking, exceptionally detailed, and absolutely unique.

&ldquo;A Constellation of Vital Phenomena&rdquo; is stunning.  It is one of the best novels I have ever read.  Ever.


I received this novel through Goodreads First Reads.  This in no way influenced my review.  I did not receive compensation for, nor was required to, write a review."
A Constellation of Vital Phenomena,0770436420,Anthony Marra,Barnes and Noble,4,WashingtonianLB,"Devastatingly beautiful. This is one of the few books that will truly move you. I had only basic knowledge of the Chechen wars before reading the novel, and afterwards found myself wishing that I knew more and knowing I would immediately seek out more books on the subject. Marra's ability to interweave historical facts with the personal narratives of eight diverse and interesting characters is simply brilliant. This is the best historical fiction I've read since Erik Larson's The Devil In the White City came out.  His prose is compelling and devastating-- as you read you can feel the pain that the characters are experiencing. The images of war are vivid and at some times graphic, but always right on the mark. This is a book that you fully immerse yourself in and after about 100 pages, simply cannot put down. The chapters are written on a timeline that is constantly jumping back and forth and I was very impressed by the way all the character&rsquo;s storylines came back together as the book finished. Marra put an incredibly amount of thought into each word he wrote and you can feel that as you read. Do not miss this book, it will change you&mdash;you just have to let it."
The End of Your Life Book Club,0307594033,Will Schwalbe,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"This book has so much to it. A close mother-son relationship that grows closer through her terminal illness. A glimpse into an inspiring woman's life. Intelligent discussion on a variety of great books. Values to share with your children.  It gives you much to ponder and leaves me wanting to contribute to life. Reminds you that a smile and sincere interest in others can do wonders. What a special woman and family. I may not know them in person, but i know them and my life is richer for that."
The End of Your Life Book Club,0307594033,Will Schwalbe,Barnes and Noble,4,RebeccaScaglione,"I'm participating in The End of Your Life Book Club discussion hosted by Jen at Devourer of Books, who was also giving the book away for this discussion!  Also participating are a few of my favs, Between the Covers, Books Speak Volumes, and The Relentless Reader.     

Anyway, since I'm going to be talking about the book in length on Devourer of Books, I'll keep my thoughts here short.  

The End of Your Life Book Club by Will Schwalbe is a memoir of the time that the author, Will, spent with his mother after she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.  Knowing she only had a few months to a few years to live, Will was determined to make the most of his time with his mom.  

They spent the doctor's appointments, chemotherapy treatments, etc., discussing books in their own tiny book club of two people.  Through the book club and following discussions, Will was able to find out more about his mom, things he never knew previously.  

Short notes on The End of Your Life Book Club:

The appendix has a full list of the many, many books talked about in this memoir, thus adding to my already-long to-read list.
The book started out a little slow for me, but picked up.  Definitely is a slower read, not one I rushed through, but worth it. 
Should you read it?  Yes, there are great lessons in the book, including just taking the time to help those in need, and taking the time to appreciate what you're lucky enough to have.
What book have you read that makes you appreciate you life? 

Thanks for reading,

The End of Your Life Book Club,0307594033,Will Schwalbe,Barnes and Noble,4,MS126,"Reading is one of my favorite things, but because of my busy life I don't have the opportunity to read as often as I'd like. Most days, I read on the bus on my way to & from work. I&rsquo;d loved Mr. Schwalbe&rsquo;s book & found it a treat to be with two individuals who love to read. I thought it might be too sad because of Mrs. Schwalbe&rsquo;s health, as I know the worry, stress, & anxiety of living & caring for a loved one dying from cancer. I could not put the book down and was annoyed when I had to close it because I had arrived at my destination. I highly recommend The End of Your Life Book Club. The triumph of the human spirit and the joy of living came through beautifully. I just purchased Daily Strength for Daily Needs because of the comfort it gave to Mrs. Schwalbe."
A Grief Observed,0060652381,C.S. Lewis,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"C.S. Lewis put into the writing the very things I felt, but could not express, in my own grief.  I felt less alone - less hopeless after getting a glimpse into another Christian's pain and suffering.  It is a short book - a collection of random thoughts he jotted down after his wife died of cancer. Easy for someone grieving to read, as concentrating is often difficult at such times.  I underlined half the book, I found it so relevant to my own situation."
A Grief Observed,0060652381,C.S. Lewis,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"I found my husband and son murdered, most books on grief I tried to read were useless and trite.  This is the only one that even came close to describing the pain I felt and how totally lost I was."
A Grief Observed,0060652381,C.S. Lewis,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"C. S. Lewis was a great thinker, but in this book, he is entirely human.  Unafraid to face the baffling questions we face when dealing with grief, Lewis goes on a heartfelt search for a faith that can withstand the deepest travails.  A very fast read, but a life affirming one.  I have found it difficult to find books that really speak to the journey of grieving, but this one is up to the task."

"Emperor Mage (Immortals, #3)",1416903372,Tamora Pierce,Barnes and Noble,4.7,TeensReadToo,"EMPEROR MAGE follows the story of Daine, now fifteen years old, a girl with the rare power of ""wild magic"" that gives her an extraordinary affinity with animals. With her wild magic, Daine can communicate with animals, see the world through their senses, and even transform herself into one, all skills that the first two books of THE IMMORTALS series have shown her develop.

In this third book, the stakes are raised as Daine accompanies an ambassadorial delegation to Carthak, where she is to use her wild magic to cure the Carthaki Emperor's sick pet birds as a show of goodwill. Carthaki ships have been attacking the coast of Daine's country of Tortall for the last year, resulting in increasingly violent skirmishes, and the intention of this delegation is to negotiate for peace between the nations.

Accompanying Daine on this trip are the famous lady knight Alanna, star of Pierce's LIONESS QUARTET, Tortall's most powerful mage and Daine's teacher, Numair, and the young dragon, Kitten.

Daine finds Carthak to be an alternately strange and disturbing place; she's not comfortable with the practice of slavery, which is legal there, or with Emperor Orzone, a powerful mage in his own right. When the peace negotiations stall, things start to heat up, and the balance of power between two great nations has been staked on the outcome.

In what is undoubtedly my favorite book of the quartet, Pierce continues to develop Daine's skills and abilities while simultaneously allowing the readers entry into the struggles that this wild mage has had to face in order to build her talent. The cast of supporting characters is large but nuanced, and although it might initially seem an easy job to discern between the two sides of the impending fight, the distinctions are increasingly and intelligently blurred.

I particularly enjoyed the further characterization of Numair, as well as the introduction of the young Prince Kaddar, who always kept me guessing. The pacing is spot on, with seemingly innocuous events leading up to a powerful climactic sequence.

I read it all the way through without stopping!"
"Emperor Mage (Immortals, #3)",1416903372,Tamora Pierce,Barnes and Noble,4.7,navelos on LibraryThing,This one was my favorite in the series. Daine heads to enemy territory and is mostly on her own in this one.
"Emperor Mage (Immortals, #3)",1416903372,Tamora Pierce,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Crowyhead on LibraryThing,"An excellent installment in the Immortals series. Daine gets caught up in political intrigue (and conflict among the gods) when she travels to Carthak on a peace mission. Emperor Orzone has indicated he is willing to open talks with Tortall, particularly if Daine is successful in curing his beloved exotic birds, which have fallen mysteriously ill."
Decision Points,0307590615,George W. Bush,Barnes and Noble,3.9,DarthDregan,"Upon leaving office I though I knew everything about Bush.  I had my mind made up that he was a mediocre president that made a lot of deicsions that weren't good for America.  Upon reading this book, and getting an indepth look at the man and his approach to decision making, life and defending our country, I have to say I have a whole new perspective of the man.  After reading this, I fully understand that every decision he made was what he honestly felt was best for the country, even keeping Dick Cheney as Veep, and honestly knowing some inside details, I probably would have made all of these decisions just like he did.  After reading this, I honestly hope history will take a kinder view of him, because I sure as heck am.

As for mechanics, it was a smooth read.  It was researched and written well.  The approach was thoroughly original for a presidential account and it wasn't a book where I was left wondering if this guy was really so full of himself.  Decision points was classy, he didn't Obama bash, or Clinton bash, or place blame for anyone else.  It was inspirational, stimulating, and absorbing; I wanted to read the next page, then just one more page, and on until the book was done.... and then I wanted more.  Most of all, it was enlightening, it was a game changer and a book that everyone could and should read, especially those like me who didn't necessarily agree with a lot of the decisions he made."
Decision Points,0307590615,George W. Bush,Barnes and Noble,3.9,KL_in_Hudson,"I have almost finished Decision Points, and find it well-written and engaging. The complexity of the issues which defined this administration -- and the agonizing care with which they were approached -- make for a fascinating read and some ""aha"" moments. President Bush's book is detailed and candid, and provides a fascinating peek into the operation of a presidency. I highly recommend it."
Decision Points,0307590615,George W. Bush,Barnes and Noble,3.9,TeacherofJustice,"I have never been a fan of President George W. Bush, however, after seeing the interviews conducted with him in regards to this book, I was interested enough to make the purchase. It has turned out to be a pleasantly surprising read and I recommend it to everyone. Regardless of your political loyalty, this book sheds a human and intelligent light on President Bush that most of us claimed to have never seen. The book does jump around a bit from topic to topic, but he warns of things not being in any real chronological order, but as he recalls it from his days leading up to, during and post-White House. Did not care for President Bush as the leader of our Country, but he has proven to be a decent, honorable and respectable man in this book that made real efforts to do the right thing even in the face of adversity. I have enjoyed reading it on my new Nook Color also, the pictures show beautifully and with great detail. May be kinda hard to get an autograph if the opportunity ever presents itself!"

The Wright Brothers,1476728747,David McCullough,Barnes and Noble,4.2,M-Goddart,We all know of the lore of the Write Brothers &ndash; the brothers who invented the airplane. But do we really know their story? Their struggles? This is an AMAZING book filled with insights. The research is incredible. The writing is strong. I highly recommend this book!
The Wright Brothers,1476728747,David McCullough,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,I know that the Wright brothers invented the airplane but that is all I knew.  Fascinating  facts and history.  The brothers were very unassuming  men who gave us the greatest invention.  This book should be a must for history buffs and people who love aviation.  I learned so much about the history of planes and the men.  Amazing.
The Wright Brothers,1476728747,David McCullough,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,I always had a desire to read about the Wright  brothers and finaly I was able to read about their lives in a no nonsense wonderfully writen book by the the master of the biography. I was impressed by their ability to create the first airplane with so little formal education.This is a must read and is full information I'll bet you didn't know.
American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House,1400063256,Jon Meacham,Barnes and Noble,3.4,coxanthony189,"Not his opinion on AJ in general.  Any objective appraisal of history or biography takes a comprehensive look at the subject, the period at hand, and will point out the positive/negatives.Yes, what happened to the Native Americans is one of the most unfortunate and shameful aspects of US history.  Andrew Jackson is only one of an assortment of people, Democrat, Republican, and Native Americans themselves, who were involved.Andrew Jackson, amongst other things, was also a war hero who defeated the British at New Orleans in the War of 1812.There are a proliferation of Anti-Americans these days who only want to look at the bad things in our history, and not the positive. To criticize a man's work before it is even published, based not on the work but your opinion of the subject of his work (and to do so anonymously I might add) is irresponsible and cowardly."
American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House,1400063256,Jon Meacham,Barnes and Noble,3.4,bluessnob,"What a great read.  This is a book that will engross you, enthrall you, and let you see what an important man Jackson was and how his reworking of the executive branch still lingers with us today.  I loathed him for the way he treated the Native Americans, and cheered him on when he fought the bank and wold be assassins.  Like or dislike him, he remains one of he most fascinating Presidents ever, in my opinion, and this book is worth the time."
American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House,1400063256,Jon Meacham,Barnes and Noble,3.4,JamieBowen0306,"Andrew Jackson was the 7th American President. He won the popular vote for President in 1824, 1828 and 1832, but only ended up getting the position in 1828 and 1832. This book looks at his presidential experience. It's important because during his presidency he created the first real political party (that we might recognise today) and was the president who pretty much forced the US into a structure we have today, with a strong executive president that leads the country and expects the states to fall in behind him.

The big issue I have with the book is that I'm not altogether sure I liked the guy. He effectively re-defined the presidency, and to do that you have to have a very clear vision and the stubbornness to see it through. The thing is, while he was a populist, and I can see why people like him, he (to me at least) epitomises all that I find wrong about America. He pushed through a number of reforms that created greater political involvement in the population, but at a cost that ensured that future presidents only mirror popular sentiment, rather than trying to lead it.

If you want to understand the American presidency, you really need to read this book, but if you do, expect to be as infuriated as you are educated. Incidentally, if you view yourself as a ""strict constructionist,"" read this book. If nothing else it might show you than even at the time the constitution was viewed as something that could be interpreted over time."

"The Forgotten (John Puller, #2)",0446573051,David Baldacci,Barnes and Noble,4.1,JacksonvilleReader,"Maybe it's time to quit reading Baldacci's books.....
I'm a long time fan of David Baldacci's books, but I would not recommend this one at all.  The first 300 pages could have been condensed into perhaps 20 and the last into 5.  Bottom line, lots of wasted pages and words. Perhaps it's the John Puller character that leaves me cold.  In reading over the initial reviews, my pulse was supposed to pound, etc.  All I kept thinking as I read this book was---seriously?  All this is going on and no one is paying attention outside a lone military man who just happened to be in town?  The topic is timely and could have been better approached than simply killing everyone and blowing up cars.  I think Baldacci's books have turned into a contest with a few other writers to see how many kills can be registered.  I'd like to see Baldacci return to true investigative type writing or even books like &quot;One Summer&quot;."

However, Lenka survived the Nazis by thinking of her Josef waiting for her every day.  After being freed by the allies, Lenka married twice and had one child.  Thirty eight years of marriage ends for Josef when Amalia died but he knows his love lives for a ghost who died decades earlier.  Several years later, Josef's grandson is marrying another war refugee Lanie's granddaughter.

 This is a great historical thriller that focuses on the long term cost of WWII on the innocent.  The story line rotates perspective over six decades between Lenka and Josef.  The changes of life brought on by Nazis is harrowing as Jews lived in a wonderful Prague Spring only to either escape to America or sent to the camps.  Alyson Richman makes a strong case that even Hitler cannot kill true love.

The Lost Wife,042524413X,Alyson Richman,Barnes and Noble,4.5,EunieKS,"This is the story of the intervening years of the lives of a Jewish couple separated a few weeks after their wedding and fifty plus years later are brought together again at the wedding of their grandchildren.  Josef, a pre-med student and Lenka, an art student, fall in love and marry just as Hitler&rsquo;s Nazi army is about to invade Prague. Knowing as Jews they are in grave danger under Nazi control, Josef&rsquo;s family finds exit visas and even secures one for Lenka.  But because her parents and sister cannot get additional visas, Lenka elects to stay with them. Josef arrives in America and eventually becomes an obstetrician.  Lenka and her family are sent to the Nazi ghetto of Terezin and later she and her sister are transported on to the dreaded Auschwitz camp.  Each believing the other is dead, Josef marries Amalia, who also escaped the Nazis and made it to America, but so damaged in mind and soul by survivor&rsquo;s guilt, she never achieves true happiness.  The two raise a family and Josef is a widower of eighty-five when the grandson is to be married.  
Lenka survives the war and marries an American soldier. She and her husband have one child, a daughter.  After fifty-two years of marriage Lenka now in her early eighties is also widowed with a granddaughter getting married.
The author based the meeting of Lenka and Josef at their grandchildren&rsquo;s wedding on an actual event in which the grandmother of the bride and the grandfather of the groom had married before WWII, and like Lenka and Josef had lost track of each other in those horrific war years. 
I&rsquo;ve read many, many Holocaust stories and each time wonder anew how mankind, any human, can cause another so much misery. 
I loved this well written novel and its two main characters who &ldquo;live&rdquo; in its pages.

But as I began to read it more intently, I relished not only the descriptions that Eco adjoins to the various eras of Western art he covers, but also the numerous quotations  from various authors, philosphers, and artist themselves as to the import of various topics Eco unfolds. It's intriguing to read the contents of such chaper headings as ""architectonic proportion,"" ""conformity with purpose,"" ""ugliness as a requirement for beauty,"" ""heroes, bodies, and ruins,"" and so forth.  Eco gives a little short shrift to the modern era, otherwsie this is a marvelous book."

"I, Claudius (Claudius, #1)",067972477X,Robert Graves,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"I, Claudius as a book is much like the life of the man it details: it gives a slow appearance to start but comes to a raging climax at the end.  Told in the first person, it chronicles the Roman Empire from its conception with the reign of Augustus(who is so frequently overshadowed by Marc Antony and Julius Caesar in our day) through the reigns of Tiberius and Caligula to Claudius' reluctant ascent.      What a fun read!  Graves, as the voice of 'Poor Uncle Claudius,' is witty and eloquent, and while his tireless attention to detail could border on suffocating in any other story, 'I, Claudius' demands it.       Our unassuming title character is more a window to the world that surrounds him than to his own life.  Most of the book is devoted to early Roman imperial history, with plenty of anecdotes to take away from the notion that history is boring.  Graves, as Claudius, is informal with the reader, allowing us to enter the hearts, minds, and bedrooms of Rome's greatest citizens.  Our Claudius, when referring to himself, is modest and dismissive, qualities that add to his charm.        The only things that could deter a reader are the exhaustingly detailed military accounts and the Latin character names, which are too numerous to keep track of.  This book is a gem; I found myself sneaking away at work just to read a few pages.  Anyone who is even mildly interested in ancient history and politics will find 'I, Claudius' a worthwhile and memorable read."
"I, Claudius (Claudius, #1)",067972477X,Robert Graves,Barnes and Noble,4.5,JGolomb,"As part of my ""advance reading"" for a trip to Rome this past summer, I read Robert Graves' ""I, Claudius"". I found Roman history rather intimidating - it's so rich and varied, and the sources are so many, that it was hard to find the right place to jump in. And so I began with history ""lite"" - historical fiction. I started with ""Claudius"" to tap into this key period of Roman History - the early Empire and the first emperors. I sought history ""lite"", though there's nothing particularly light-weight about Graves' masterpiece.

Graves' seminal work, which is also well known from its British TV offering, is dense. It's not for those looking for nice light beach reading. ""I, Claudius"" is an exceedingly well-crafted history of the first four Emperors of the Roman Empire - roughly 30 B.C. when Augustus rose to sole power, through Tiberius and Caligula, to 41 A.D. when Caligula is murdered, and Claudius is declared emperor. 

Graves gives voice to his story by writing through a series of Claudius' own memoirs. The bulk of the book focuses on the empire's first two emperors - Augustus and Tiberius - and the rather strong willed, smart, and devious Livia, Augustus' wife and Tiberius' mother. Much of the story's perspective is naturally biased however much Claudius (and Graves) posit alternative opinions on who murdered whom, by what method, and whether or not anyone really cared.

One must keep in mind how much of the story is ""history"" and how much is ""fiction"". I've dug into a good bit of Roman Empire non-fiction and have found many of the stories to be consistent with at least some of the ancient sources. Even in the non-fiction realm, there's plenty of room for debate over facts and details.

The book contains an inordinate amount of detail around historic names and relationships, but I realized about half-way through that this was a necessary evil considering the topic. 

""I, Claudius"" is beautifully written, and creatively conveys the nature of lives lived in near omnipotence, as well as fear and paranoia. Claudius comes across as erudite, insightful, rational and caring. His musings on palace intrigue run from humorous to serious to sad. ""I, Claudius"" is one of those rare epic tales that will drift into your consciousness well after you've finished. It's also one of those stories that will push you into wanting more. And fortunately there is more. 

Grave's ""Claudius the God"" covers his reign and unfortunate taste in spouses (Messalina and Agrippina, who ultimately poisoned him). While not as strong as ""I, Claudius"", it'll feed your need for Roman intrigue."
"I, Claudius (Claudius, #1)",067972477X,Robert Graves,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Awesomeness1,"I decided to read this book based off a Sparknotes recommendation. I've always been interested in Ancient Rome and historical-fiction, and this seemed to be a perfect combination. 

This classic account by Robert Graves takes the form of Tiberius Claudius Drusus Nero Germanicus's autobiography. Claudius is dismissed as a lame simpleton since his birth. Surprisingly, this is why Claudius manages to survive the murders and betrayals that surround him during the reign of three emperors, only to become emperor himself. 

This is a good book. I realize that and repsect that. It just wasn't for me. The endless lists of characters were confusing, and their relationships to each other were very difficult to keep track of. Since there were so many characters, none of them were very much developed. The whole thing just seemed a little impersonal. My favorite parts were when Claudius actually had a conversation with people instead of just describing distant wars. 

I did like the humor that was sprinkled in, and some of the characters were delightfully evil (I love you, Livia!). I read this very slowly, only reading around 60 pages a day. I think I absorbed it better that way. I wonder how accurate Graves was. I won't be checking out the sequel to this book, but I'm gonna get the miniseries on Netflix and see if I like it."
"The Testing (The Testing, #1)",0547959109,Joelle Charbonneau,Barnes and Noble,4.4,lsmeadows,"Whenever a book becomes hugely popular, there are bound to be a lot of copy cat books that occur. With the huge success of The Hunger Games, the market has been inundated with dystopian books targeted to the Young Adult market. In that respect, The Testing by Joelle Charbonneau is no different from the rest. It is definitely a book based on the very successful formula used in the Hunger Games trilogy. There are, however, some differences. These differences, coupled with the author's obvious talent for writing, make this one copy cat that is well worth the read. 




The Seven Stages War has left the Earth devastated. It is in this environment the the new United Commonwealth finds itself trying to survive. To meet this goal, the UC needs to discover the best and the brightest that its various colonies have to offer. Their talents and skills, along with a coveted education at The University, are needed to rebuild the Earth. To aid this process, the government of the UC has devised The Testing. 




Like the Hunger Games and others, the story in The Testing relies on Young Adult protagonists who are thrown into a do or die situation which they must navigate by using their skills and intellect. Another similarity to most of the books of this type, their is romantic interest between some of the characters. The most important similarities to the Hunger Games, though, is the author's ability to craft characters that the reader can identify with. People that you want to win and survive. In addition, the author's ability to tell the story in an engrossing, intriguing way that draws the reader in is another similarity. 




To me, though, the similarities that this book had to the others, especially the Hunger Games, were less important than what it had that its differences. Although survival is a big part of this story, it is not the only attribute that is important. For example, I really liked the way that The Testing was structured. I found the author's use of testing environment that looked at the participant's academics, decision making abilities, problem solving skills, and team work skills, set this story apart. The fact that the characters needed more to accomplish their goals than just survival skills was more to my liking. In addition, I really liked the way that the author included the understanding of several scientific abilities in the main characters arsenal, and the fact that they were able to discuss these abilities amongst themselves. There were some other differences that I particularly liked as well, but most of them were things that would spoil the story if I listed them. All of these differences, though, went a long way toward allowing me to feel that this story had its own identity. 




Even though I knew where this book was heading, could guess most of the twists, and was not surprised by any of the situations, I really enjoyed this book and am looking forward to reading the rest of the trilogy. In fact, I found it as enjoyable as the Hunger Games and think that the fact that the stories are so similar one of the things that I particularly enjoyed. Reading this story felt like visiting an old friend, but yet there was plenty to discover at the same time. I give it 4 stars."
"The Testing (The Testing, #1)",0547959109,Joelle Charbonneau,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Tina_Chan,"Review: 


Okay, before I begin my rant on The Testing, please hear me out. First of all, The Testing was written very well&mdash;under normal 
circumstances I would&rsquo;ve adored The Testing. But here&rsquo;s the catch&mdash;I read The Hunger Games before I read The Testing and that 
basically screwed everything up. There were so many parallels between The Testing and The Hunger Games it wasn&rsquo;t even funny. 
Now get this&mdash;I loved reading The Hunger Games, so it would only be logical for me to like The Testing, right? Wrong&mdash;there were way 
too many similarities the first &frac34; of the book for me to enjoy (the last &frac14; was probably my favorite part since it was actually DIFFERENT!).  
Half the time I noticed a similarity between the two books I felt like slamming my head against a wall. No joke. I know, I know&mdash;I 
probably sound wicked whiney and like one of those people complaining about The Hunger Games being a &ldquo;rip off&rdquo; of Battle Royal
 (I apologize if you are one of those people). So I guess I should justify my mini rant. Below is a list of similarities between The Testing 
and The Hunger Games.
 
Hunger Games: country is split into districts with one capital
The Testing: country is split into colonies with one capital
Hunger Games: each district specializes in one occupation
The Testing: each colony specializes in one field of science
Hunger Games: children from each district are selected to participated in the Games
The Testing: children from colonies are selected to participate in the Test
Hunger Games: participation is mandatory
The Testing: participation is mandatory
Hunger Games: main character is Katniss who is thrown into the Games with a guy from her district named Peeta
The Testing: main character is Cia who gets thrown into the Test with a guy from her colony named Thomas
Hunger Games: silver parachute brings Katniss supplies
The Testing: brown cloth bag thrown over the fence brings Cia supplies
Hunger Games: Peeta gets severely injured; Katniss heals him
The Testing: Thomas gets severely injured; Cia heals him
Hunger Games: mutts attack Katniss
The Testing: weird animal/human hybrids attack Cia
Hunger Games: Katniss protects Prim back in her district
The Testing: Cia protects Daileen in her colony
Hunger Games: Katniss buries Rue
The Testing: Cia buries dead girl from some other colony
Hunger Games: the capital is always watching them
The Testing: the testing officials are always watching them
Hunger Games: &ldquo;May the odds ever be in your favor.&rdquo;
The Testing: &ldquo;Best of luck.&rdquo;
 
I think you get my point&hellip;But this book is not without merits. The writing was good&mdash;just enough descriptions to get by but not too much 
so that it bogs down the book. All of the characters were likable enough, though I just couldn&rsquo;t seem to connect with Cia. I think that she
 is maybe&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;too perfect? Is that even possible? There was definitely one unexpected twist at the end of the book&hellip;actually
, two unexpected events I totally did not find coming, so bravo to the author for that!
 
I would recommend this book if you enjoyed The Hunger Games and don&rsquo;t mind reading a book that is in the same genre and has a 
similar plot line.
 
Likes: * The writing was well done and was suitable for the theme of the novel
            	*likable characters
Dislikes: *way too much like The Hunger Games
            	*could not connect to main character"
"The Testing (The Testing, #1)",0547959109,Joelle Charbonneau,Barnes and Noble,4.4,KDH_Reviews,"If you&rsquo;ve read any other reviews about The Testing, you&rsquo;ve probably already heard the comparison between it and The Hunger Games trilogy. It was one of the very first things I heard about it. &ldquo;If you liked The Hunger Games, you&rsquo;ll like The Testing.&rdquo; Well, I like The Hunger Games, but I didn&rsquo;t think it was fair to try to compare this book to it. It&rsquo;s bound to happen, though. There&rsquo;s so many similarities that it would be hard not to compare the two. While there are similarities between the two, there are enough differences between the two that it doesn&rsquo;t seem like you are reading the same story over again with different names and whatnot. I&rsquo;ll say I agree with the statement, though. If you liked The Hunger Games trilogy, there&rsquo;s a very good chance you&rsquo;ll enjoy The Testing. I know I did.

I felt like the first few chapters moved a bit slowly. Since they are building up some of the background to the good stuff, I don&rsquo;t feel like it really brings the story down. Once the story picks up, a few chapters in, it doesn&rsquo;t stop. When the story picked up for me, the book was really hard to put down. It sucked me in and didn&rsquo;t let me go, even when the book ended (mostly because the story isn&rsquo;t over). I&rsquo;m really looking forward to reading the next book and finding out more about The Testing.

"Takedown Twenty (Stephanie Plum, #20)",0345542886,Janet Evanovich,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Avid_ReaderLL,"I would have probably gone two stars, but I feel the need to offset the 4 and 5 star ratings this book is getting. I liked this book better the first time I read it...as Three To Get Deadly! I think JE even references the fact they are so similar. When? In this book, Stephanie is trying to apprehend Uncle Sunny, Joe's Godfather, and someone so beloved by people that no one wants to help her and everyone is mad at her? Sound familiar?? At one point, she knocks Sunny unconscious and as he comes around he mumbles 'chocolate ice cream'. In Three to Get Deadly, her beloved skip she's trying to get owns the ice cream parlor in town. Coincidence?? You decide.

Overall, same stuff different book. Is it funny to read? Sure. However, I have the same complaint I've had for several books now. No forward movement. I hate that Stephanie is Joe's girlfriend, but is messing around with Ranger. At least she didn't sleep with both of them in this book - there's an improvement. If JE is just going to continue to recycle stories from her better, earlier books, then just end the series. Either move the characters and story forward or stick a fork in it. At the very least, put some thought into the books and give the characters some depth along with a new storyline. These just feel phoned in. I'm starting to put her in the same category as James Patterson - does she even write these anymore or is it her and some other author and it's the other author that probably does the most writing. What made me love the Plum books in the beginning just doesn't seem to exist in the books anymore.

I enjoyed this series through book 14 (some argue 12 was the last good one, but I loved 13 and 14 too). So, if you're in a Plum mood, go back to the beginning and read the earlier ones. They are great re-reads and better than what is being put out now."
"Takedown Twenty (Stephanie Plum, #20)",0345542886,Janet Evanovich,Barnes and Noble,3.7,javagra,"I have read all the Stephanie Plums including the between the numbers.  This is by far the worst.  Though, I must admit it seems I feel that way with each new book starting with about 16.  I really believe Janet is only continuing because she is under contract.  I don't believe she had any interest in continuing this series.  This book was just flat out boring.  I'm also kind of sick with her kissing Ranger in the morning and Morelli at night.  It is one thing to have the hots for two men but another to be acting the way she is.  I think I'm done buying books in this series."
"Takedown Twenty (Stephanie Plum, #20)",0345542886,Janet Evanovich,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Literary_Marie,"&quot;I'm a big stupid failure!&quot; ~ pg. 52 (Well said, Stephanie Plum.)

Takedown Twenty is the 20th book in the Stephanie Plum series by Janet Evanovich. New Jersey bounty hunter Stephanie Plum has to take down mob boss Uncle Sunny. Although he is charged with murder, the community is secretive about his whereabouts. Besides getting the run-around, Stephanie is also tasked with helping Ranger solve a bizarre death. They partner with Grandma Mazur to catch a killer, in between bingo games, at the senior citizen home.

St. Louis Post calls Stephanie Plum novels &quot;laugh-out-loud funny.&quot; The Denver Post claims they are &quot;brilliantly evocative.&quot; USA Today states they are &quot;winning hearts.&quot; ARE WE READING THE SAME SERIES?!

*deep exhale* Why oh why do I keep reading the Stephanie Plum series? I might as well stop reading at this 20th installment and pick back up for the final book (if I am alive). I am convinced this series will outlast my life. It's never-freaking-ending! I am sick of the only black character Lulu stereotypically eating fried chicken and wearing kool-aid weave. There possibly can't be any more available cars for skips to blow up. The only surprise are random ass animals (this time, a giraffe named Kevin) showing up in the story. Let's face it, Plum fans; Morelli, Stephanie and Ranger will forever be a love triangle. I cannot continue riding out this series. My patience has been zapped by Grandma Mazur's stun gun. Throw me in a casket at the local Trenton funeral home. I am done.

The Boy Who Sneaks in My Bedroom Window,1469984016,Kirsty Moseley,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,Ive read many books but this book was amazing in every single way down to the last detail of an amazing story.
The Boy Who Sneaks in My Bedroom Window,1469984016,Kirsty Moseley,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Book_WhispererJO,"&quot;Sometime I feel like there's a hole inside of me, an emptiness that at times seems to burn. I think if you lifted my heart to your ear, you could probably hear the ocean.... I have this dream of being whole. Of not going to sleep each night, wanting. But still sometimes, when the wind is warm or the crickets sing... I dream of a love that even time will lie down and be still for.&quot; Quote from Practical Magic. 

I know probably wondering why on earth I would post a quote from a movie for a review. Well I finished this book, and this was immediately stuck in my head. Amber and Liam are this love that time will lie down for. This is young adult novel, but it is so incredible deep that all ages will love it. This is not your first love story, but rather a TRUE LOVE STORY! I was blown away by this carefully and intricately crafted story that flows through these pages. The hidden meaning and deep emotion wrapped around every thought and action is incredible. Even for Liam being the neighbor; after climbing into Amber's bed the first time he had agreed to share her life. Even at the age of ten he was devoted to her accepting all of the pain and torture of abuse was not her's alone, but theirs to share. Which unfolded into a story of hope and love, and the proof that people really can overcome their pasts. I was awed, but the obvious talented displayed in Moseley's writing. Jake, Liam, and Amber are all very close; so effectively writing a story that consistently carries them all was difficult, but this incredibly talented woman did it. Not only did she do it, but she perfected it! Not once did I feel a shift amongst the characters. Leaving readers concerned by every development in the book, and how it will effect everyone involved.  

What I had expected to be primarily a love story ended up being so much more. It almost carries story within a story, within a story feel to this book. Amber and Liam will struggle obstacles one after another. Although, the climatic ending is an obstacle that they all will share. I felt that this tied the story up so effectively. At first, it gave Liam and Amber time to grow with their problems, but bring them all back together in the ending seems to only enforce the bonds shown throughout the story. Almost like making a final statement that they are a unit, and that is the way they will remain. I loved every single minute of this story, and can not even being to do this story the justice in words. It is incredible and inspiring... BookWhisperer Favorite!!!"
The Boy Who Sneaks in My Bedroom Window,1469984016,Kirsty Moseley,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Smith-Kidman,"This book was nothing like I thought it would be. The description
doesn't do this book justice.  The book begins with an eight year old
girl named Amber and her ten year old brother Jake living in fear of
their father's wrath. They are beaten continuously by their father and
Amber is subjected to more then just her father's fists. Liam the boy
next door as well as Jake's best friend sees Amber crying in her room
and decides to comfort her by sneaking into her bedroom. He falls asleep
with her which leads to an eight year habit.   The book skips forward to
a 16 year old Amber that has been mentally scarred by her father's extra
attention. When she was 15, Jake and Liam discovered their father trying
to rape her after almost beating her to death. They take matters in to
their own hands and make him leave for good. Amber hates to be touched
by anyone because memories come flooding back.  Liam is one of the best
male character's I have ever read about. In the begginning Amber merely
looks at him as her brother's man-whore cocky best friend but slowly
starts to see him in a different light. She sees him in two different
ways daytime Liam who is cocky and a man-whore and then there is
nighttime Liam who is sweet and loving. Nighttime Liam chases away her
demons and makes her feel complete.   Amber starts to realize that her
feelings for Liam are more then friendship, which gives Liam the go
ahead to finally be with the girl that he has been in love with since he
was a child. He calls her his Angel because he believes that god must
have put her there just for him.   This story is a must read for anyone
that hasn't read it. Liam and Amber stole my heart."
"Terrier (Beka Cooper, #1)",037581468X,Tamora Pierce,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Chrissy_Mae,"I got hooked to Tamora Peirce when I was proably in the 7th or 8th grade. I wore out the copies of Alanna and Daine's books at the library, and put a good hurting on the hardback copies of Keladry's story. Even as I got older, and the librarian started to comment on the books they had for the older age groups I now fell in, I still came back again and again to the back of the bottom shelf where they were kept. So understand that this review is written with the bias of an unwavering fan. :)

The characters was excellent, and not at all what I expected. Beka, the ancestor of George Cooper, was not the girl I had imagined Peirce would write when I first heard about the possibility of the series, years ago. Instead she is an average girl that most can relate with. 

I thought the diary entries would throw me off, since most of the journal style books I have read do. But Peirce kept the entries even and detailed, and the plot moves quickly, so it didn't bother me as much as I thought. 

Terrier is an excellent read and I highly recommend it, especialy for preteen and early teen girls."
"Terrier (Beka Cooper, #1)",037581468X,Tamora Pierce,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Apples_and_Parachutes,"Terrier started off slowly with all the different journal entries from various people, but after that, the story picked up quickly.  I thought the idea of the Dogs was brilliant.  Beka's strength and determination was refreshing.  All the characters, especially Goodwin and Tunsall, were realistic and shared Beka's quick eagerness.  I enjoyed the journal format, especially when Beka's mood or sleepiness clearly changed how she wrote.  I definately recommend Terrier."

"First Grave on the Right (Charley Davidson, #1)",0312662750,Darynda Jones,Barnes and Noble,4.3,LaurenJ11,"I am so impressed by the fact that this book read like a 'bestseller': it kept the pages turning, the dialogue was quick and witty, and I felt I might run into the characters the next time I was in Albuquerque--they felt that real. But at the same time, this book does NOT read like yet another from your favorite author. Darynda Jones has found a new, fresh flavor to write with, and this book is completely unique. Charley and the other characters are personalities you've never had the please of meeting before (and you will love them!). They get into (and out of) situations you never thought possible, and their interactions feel true to life . . . well, if you are willing to believe that the grim reaper is a hot PI who shines like a beacon to the dead! Charley Davidson is smart, sassy, sexy . . . the only thing I don't like about her is that I can't BE her. And her amazingly tasty mystery man had my mouth watering! I loved the outstanding character development; the story is interesting and will keep you hooked from page one to the very end--I read straight through, and now I am craving more! Can't wait for Second Grave, and Third, and Fourth, and . . ."
"First Grave on the Right (Charley Davidson, #1)",0312662750,Darynda Jones,Barnes and Noble,4.3,bookhimdanno,"I liked it, very sarcastic, set in the first person. It reminded me of the way I think, I don't vocalize what I think, most of the time(it would get me into as much trouble as it does her). Charley Davidson is a kick butt PI and a grim reaper. She's fast and funny with a quick comment to make about everything. I liked her uncle and the cop that she butts heads with. Reyes is hot, hot, hot and boy what a shock when you learn his origin. Not much real sex, supernatural love, at least a bit. This was funny, fast paced and interesting to read. I look forward to the next book she writes to see what happens in Charley's life.

Anya's Ghost,1596437138,Vera Brosgol,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"I enjoyed this book. It is probably meant to be a YA title, but I enjoyed it as an adult too. This starts off with an ordinary girl, originally, from Russia, going to high school. She falls into a well and cannot get out. Inside the well is a skeleton and a ghost girl. Ghost girl helps Anya in many ways even after she gets out of the well. But is this ghost who she claims to be? Of course not... This is when things get interesting. 

I would love to read a sequel to this book. The artwork is a clear and enjoyable style. I recommend this book to young adults. Be aware, though, she smokes and cuts class. Not a good role model. 

She is just an ordinary girl trying to fit in, and find her true self. It all works out in the end. And, she realizes that she does not need to smoke to be cool. She also finds some self respect, and decides that she does not pursue her crush when she finds out that he is a womanizer who mistreats his girlfriend.

Highly recommended!"
Anya's Ghost,1596437138,Vera Brosgol,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"Awesome book-- and this is coming from a pesky manga loving teenager. Basically the plot of the book is about this Russian girl, Anya, and she meets a ghost who claims her and her parents were murdered. The book moves along very quickly, so I won't mention anything more in fear that I'll give it away... I'd say the age range is... 11-16. Check it out :p you know you wanna."
Anya's Ghost,1596437138,Vera Brosgol,Barnes and Noble,4.3,niahflame,"Decent graphic novel, if a little preachy. Anya is a bit of a b. and I don't get why she's so angry all the time. Because she's fat? Come on. 




Nice twist at the end, but the ghost is the best part of the book."
The Rules of Attraction,067978148X,Bret Easton Ellis,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Ninja_Dog,"In this novel, Ellis establishes the universe of characters for his more gruesome and surreal novels, ""Amecian Psycho"" and ""Glamorama."" Considered his most lighthearted novel, ""The Rules of Attraction"" still manages a level of darkness and inevitability. 
Each chapter is written from different perspectives of students at Camden college, the fictional analogue to Ellis' own East Coast alma mater.  The three main characters constitute a twisted romantic triangle that's both petty and destructive. Sean Bateman (the brother of American Psycho's Patric Bateman) is infatuated with Lauren (the Lauren Hynde from Glamorama).  Lauren fails to get over her love for Victor (the same Victor that's Glamorama's protagonist) while getting involved with Sean... and several others. Paul adds another layer to the conflict, sharing history with Lauren and becoming infatuated with Sean.
Like with ""Less Than Zero,"" the characters in this novel fail to learn from their moral shortcomings.  While a ""heroic"" story will have morally flawed characters learn and grow from their trials, such is not the case in an Ellis novel.  This story starts out reprehensible and just gets more destructive from there. Conflicts and pathologies totally lack resolution throughout and the novel ends with a broken, unfinished sentence, underscoring the finality of their collective drama. 
Despite the darkness of the plot structure, ""The Rules Of Attraction"" boasts some extremely funny chapters, including a chapter by Sean's French roommate written entirely in French.  Getting a translation is well worth it, as his whining and arrogant love letter to Lauren is genuinely funny. Sean also has a chapter where he discusses a relationship with a hippie that I laughed out loud at several times. 
Both the moral depravity and the black humor of this novel are something of an embryonic necessity for this young author, suggesting the greater works of American Psycho and Glamorama that will follow this novel.  While not ""great"" on it's own, I recommend that anyone interested in Ellis read this short novel before trying to tackle the gut-wrenching masterpiece of ""American Psycho"" or the existential nightmare of ""Glamorama."""
The Rules of Attraction,067978148X,Bret Easton Ellis,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Katanahun,"I first read this book when I was twelve years old.  The book was rather dark, but I thought that was a plus.  I fell in love with all of the characters, and connected to all of them. Easton Ellis can capture emotion, and come up with three beautiful and out-of-the-ordinary characters that are easy to see yourself in.  After reading, I saw relationships from a different perspective, and I still do.  Buy this book now."
The Rules of Attraction,067978148X,Bret Easton Ellis,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"This hilariously realistic story is about as dark as they get, but in this depressive college dating story you find a tapestry of interesting characters leading entertaining lives and telling intertwining stories. In this story, the people who want to hook up with each other rarely do, and when they do it isn't usually what they thought it would be. Very few other romance stories actually leave you feeling that it is a believable story. This one people can relate to.    Another good one is Christmas at Sibyl's. A friend bought it for me and it's now one of my favorite Christmas stories."
"The Good, the Bad, and the Undead (The Hollows, #2)",0060572973,Kim Harrison,Barnes and Noble,4.5,kimtiffani,"As a sequal, this one picked right up where the last left off. The chacters are all here for the next chapter of this thriling series. I finally figured out Trent before the book told me. I still am working on some of the questions. Like- Why is Tent scared of Rachel? Who is Nick really? And what is on the agenda next for Ivy? On my way to Barnes and Nobel to get the third book.

Even my son is liking this series! 

If you are up for a great thriller, mystery and a funny book (Jenks is a hoot!) this is the series for you! Don't just take my word, read the first one and get hooked like I did.

Looking for another easy series to get caught up in? Try Marked or Twilight. They both are great, nonstop intrigue and fun, just can't seem to put them down."
"The Good, the Bad, and the Undead (The Hollows, #2)",0060572973,Kim Harrison,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Easily_obsessed,"Kim Harrison must be a big Clint fan since she has based several of her titles in this series on Clint Eastwood films.  There is even a reference in the book to a Clint Eastwood movie marathon.  This second book in the Rachel Morgan series, The Good, The Bad, and The Undead, offers up a tighter crime drama than the first book, builds on the culture of this alternate universe, and hints at mysteries of the past.  The writing has improved from the first book (though I still see typos) and the dark humor is laugh-out-loud funny.  I love the lingo created by the ""history"" that predates the story.  The romance between Rachel and her boyfriend Nick from the first book alternately heats up and cools down as they forge an unusual bond.  Rachel's vampire partner Ivy struggles against her nature while Ivy's boyfriend makes a pass at Rachel, in a way that only a vampire can.  Meanwhile Rachel warily partners with her enemy Trent Kalamack, whom she tried to bring down in the first book.  There are grotesque scenes of death, a dangerous demon working more than one side, and a surprise romantic ending.  The first book wasn't bad, but this one is an improvement that makes me want to know more.  Some books read like a movie.  This one reads like a cult-favorite TV show, episodic but with a back story that will keep building as it is slowly revealed."

"The Crystal Shard (Forgotten Realms: Icewind Dale, #1; Legend of Drizzt, #4)",0786942460,R.A. Salvatore,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Guest,"Even though this is book four of the Drizzt series this is probably the best one to start with. The story starts in the frozen tundra of Icewind Dale and follows Bruenor the stubborn dwarf, Wulfgar the young and powerful barbarian (though a bit naive) and Drizzt the mad cool dark elf with unmatched battle prowess.  This is an excellent book even for those new to or not normally attracted to the fantasy genre. It is a classic and, in my humble opinion, one of the best story's in the genre of all time."
"The Crystal Shard (Forgotten Realms: Icewind Dale, #1; Legend of Drizzt, #4)",0786942460,R.A. Salvatore,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Guest,"Every saga has a beginning, but most do not tend to capture you as this book does. I have spend laborous nights flipping through stories that were said to be great, but had no real spark. I started this book, knowing that it looked right down my alley, and I did not realize I had read nearly all of it by the time I saw the clock. The characters are so unique, and there is a character for every personality, so everyone has a character they relate to. The perils are not rare happenings, and there is always some sort of action that keeps you sucked into the pages, while maintaining a deep storyline. Awesome!"
"The Crystal Shard (Forgotten Realms: Icewind Dale, #1; Legend of Drizzt, #4)",0786942460,R.A. Salvatore,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Guest,"RA Salvator is the main auther that I have read from.  I myself am an inspiring writer and RA Salvator is a big reason to that.  The first book of his I read was The Thousand Orcs, and that with the battles captivated me into his world.  I had to read more of Drizzt.  The second book I read was The Legacy, and I had to read how it started.  Finaly, I got this book.  This is by far my favorite book.  It was Salvators first book with Drizzt, and by far the best.  Salvator is so awesome in his writing.  He is so descriptive, but he leaves room for imagination.  Part of reading is imagining it in your head.  No doubt most readers have different pictures painted in their head when the army of monsters start to seige the largest of Ten-Towns, but still, they are similar and mainly the same due to his unique imagination that he finely paints with words in his stories.  This is the best Drizzt book of all of them, and the best book I have read. The greatest aspect of the book is the characters.  Out of any other story or movie or anything, no characters are more vivid or uniquely created than the Companions of the Hall and the enemies.  Artmemis and Jarlaxle are so cool, especialy Jarlaxle, he is the man."
Wide Sargasso Sea,0140274219,Jean Rhys,Barnes and Noble,3.1,mthelibrarian on LibraryThing,"The change in narrators between sections is confusing, but Part 3 made me think I should go back to the beginning and start it again. I may do so in the future, but not right now."
Wide Sargasso Sea,0140274219,Jean Rhys,Barnes and Noble,3.1,miriamparker on LibraryThing,"Blech. This is the most hackneyed idea. And something about this book just really, really bothers me. It makes me angry. I hate, hate, hate literary ""revisitings."" They make me want to vomit. Think up your own idea for god's sake."
Wide Sargasso Sea,0140274219,Jean Rhys,Barnes and Noble,3.1,fieldnotes on LibraryThing,"It is always a risky thing to create a narrative voice far below your own intelligence level. I find that authors less skillful than, say, Faulkner, end up producing poor quality, simple prose without managing to evoke youthfulness or naivety. The first portion of ""Wide Sargasso Sea"", suffers from the young teenage voice of Antoinette. I find it easy to scoff at passages like, ""I woke next morning knowing that nothing would be the same. It would change and go on changing"" or ""I prayed for a long time to be dead. Then remembered that this was a sin. It's presumption or despair, I forget which, but a mortal sin. So I prayed for a long time about that too, but the thought came, so many things are sins, why? Another sin, to think that."" What's wrong with those passages (aside from their over-convenient simplifications)? They are sandwiched between passages like, ""if we were never envious, they never seemed vain. Helene and Germain, a little disdainful, aloof perhaps, but Louise, not even that."" and ""This remark is made in a casual and perfunctory voice and she slides on to order and chastity, that flawless crystal that, once broken, can never be mended."" It's unreasonable to expect readers to receive these four utterances as if they all occurred naturally to the same teenage girl. Narrative consistency matters.The second part of the book is stronger and almost convinced me to forgive the first part of the novel (which had altogether lost my sympathy) on the basis of the strong contrast set up between them. We are all prepared to notice the shortcomings of Mr. Rochester's perspective. Rhys does not have to be terribly overt about his jealousy, his pride, his fear and his ignorance; these are clear to the reader because of how Mr. Rochester narrates and what he chooses to focus on. The second part is strong and entertaining and the show-down between Christophine (the book's most memorable character) and Mr. Rochester is very well done. While the Iago-like, lurking half-brother of Antoinette with his obnoxious letters, bribery and intrigue was a bit tedious and overdone, the second part of ""Wide Sargasso Sea"" still commands and rewards attention.For better or for worse, I have not read ""Jane Eyre""; so, the interplay between ""Wide Sargasso Sea"" and Bronte's novel is completely lost on me. As a result, I have no reason to forgive or accept the disappointing and forced third and final ""part"" of the novel. To make a novel so dependent on its relationship to another novel is also, somewhat of a risky decision. If I ever get around to ""Jane Eyre"", I may come back and give this review a second look. But, for now, I wouldn't recommend this particular take on wealthy-white-person-undone-by-tropics to anyone who is not a junky of this particular sub-genre."
The Magus,0316296198,John Fowles,Barnes and Noble,3.9,MaxMatters,"This is one of those books where it seems the author didn't have an ending to the story in mind. The first half of the book does a good job of developing the plot and characters. It then seems to wander aimlessly with subplots that never connect with the rest of the theme. The ""trial"" is a low point - a macaber element right out of a Steven King novel - unnecessary it seems to the story for nothing would change if it were left out. The whole episode with ""Nygaard"" never makes its way to an understanding by the reader of why it is even in the book. Finally, there's ""Jojo"" a meaningless character at the end of the novel who meanders into the story only to meander right back out. It all leaves the reader disappointed with the way the book just ends; never  explaining anything of what has taken place. The main character of ""Maurice Conchis"" just disappears....leaving the reader begging for an explanation. It never comes, neither does a satisfactory ending."
The Magus,0316296198,John Fowles,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"This book was my introduction to Fowles, and I was not disappointed.  Even though the plot line may be a bit too fanciful for some, the depth and complexity of the main character, Nicholas, is unsurpassed.  Fowles creation is up there with the greatest characters of all time.  At least in our day and age, a Nicholas Urfe is more human than say Hamlet and just as human as anyone from Yoknapatawpha.  As others have noted, reading the novel can lead to introspection, which may actually change the way you perceive life."
The Magus,0316296198,John Fowles,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"Without a doubt, this is the most uneven novel I have ever read. Fowles gives the reader flashes of great talent and moments of incredulity. The Magus will chill you, inspire you, anger you, and leave you wishing you could recover the twelve hours invested.

"You (You, #1)",1476785597,Caroline Kepnes,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"This book is absolutely wonderful and I am dying for this author to release another! I was hooked quickly by the writing and the realistic approach. Being young and living in an age full of technology, it is extremely easy for someone to have a stalker without realizing it. The moment I finished the book, I instantly wanted to go back to page one to read it again. 

I completed reading this book in two days. I simply could not get enough. Yes, this book is dark and honestly messed up is putting it lightly. At one point I felt as if everything had a chance of working out for the best and then a moment later everything fell apart so quickly. 

Overall this book has become one of my favorites."
"You (You, #1)",1476785597,Caroline Kepnes,Barnes and Noble,4,Shanrock19,"Okay...this is a tough one.  I liked the book, and I thought the writing was pretty good, but it's an off putting book.  It's a really dark subject, and I think it's a good thing I didn't like any of the characters; I felt separated from them and I didn't really care for them, so some of the things happening to them really didn't have the full impact it would of had if I had cared more.  I suppose that may be a bad thing because it didn't really draw me into the story.  I think the book is a bit long; I was getting tired of it after awhile, and I was disappointed with the end.  The author did an excellent job of showing the reader the inside of the main character's head.  The story is creepy and haunting and I think the author did a good job of portraying the oddness of the story.  That's why I think I mainly liked the story.  I just wish the ending was different, and the characters were a bit more redeemable, but alas that was not the case.  I also want to give a bit of a warning; this book does get a bit graphic, and the wording is intense.  The book is a bit depressing, but if you like darkly weird stories; this is a good book for you."

Playing for Pizza,0385525001,John Grisham,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Anonymous,"Playing for Pizza by John Grisham	When I checked this novel out from the library, I had predicted how it would unfold.  And I turned out to be completely right. I did this with some assistance from the blurb. The main character, Rick Dockery, is a sub-par quarterback that loves to play the game. After he is cut from his most recent NFL team, Rick signs with a team in Italy. And from that I came to the conclusion that it would be somewhat of a comedy that deals with him adjusting to Italian culture, while at the same time trying to help his new team win a championship. So yes it¿s a very predictable plot. 	But that doesn¿t automatically bring down the quality of the book. It had a very good message: the NFL lifestyle is over luxurious, and there¿s really no passion for the game. In the Italian league, with exception to the American players, there are no salaries. The Italian athletes see pro football as a club, and have actual careers to support their financial needs. And they are fine with that. They have the passion for the sport that is missing, for the most part, from pro football in America. That is the theme I love from this novel.      Before when I said I predicted it was a comedy, that¿s on overstatement. Grisham has a way of wording things. When I hear them in my head as I read, they are really funny. This happens especially when Rick is practicing for the first few times with his new team. As you would have guessed the skill level in a Europe league is far below that of the NFL, and they have a different style of practice. So consequently Rick has trouble adjusting to the skill level of his offensive line and wide receivers. The way Grisham delineates Rick¿s frustration is very funny.Something else I like about this book is the references to the real world. Several times Grisham mentions real NFL teams and players. And apparently the way Italian culture is portrayed here is very accurate. All the Italians teams are real, and the reputations are real. For example, in the text, the Bergamo Lions is the powerhouse of the league, and has one the championship the past nine years in a row. I looked this up on internet and its true. That is a big positive for me. But no book is perfect. And Playing for Pizza is exhibit A to this statement. The ending was quite the disappointment. I¿m not going to spoil anything, but let¿s just say it leaves the reader very clueless about the future of Rick¿s career. This was something I was intrigued with and was looking forward learning how it played out. But Grisham leaves it up to the reader¿s imagination. I hate it when authors do that. 	Another flaw is the many things Rick gets involved in besides football. The most annoying of which are his numerous Italian love interests. Rick has spends a lot of times thinking about girls, two in particular, and whenever I got to one of these chapters I felt very inclined to just skip it. It just seemed to get in the way from what the book could have been. I understand the setting is in Italy and it would be hard to ignore this theme, but it would probably be worth it. I chose this book because it had to do with football, not romance. But there is enough football that it can get confusing for someone who is unfamiliar with the game. By this I mean there is frequent use of football terms. This is no problem whatsoever for me, but could frustrate some people. 	But the pros greatly overpower the cons, and overall it was an enjoyable read. I highly"

The words just flowing along like a babbling brook even though the text itself is not tranquil, it is the way the author strings the words together that brought harmony to its composition.  Written in verse, Jacqueline tells her families story.  Her father is content and determined to maintain his Northern upbringing while her mother loves the South.  There is conflict among the parents but in the end, mother returns to her childhood home with the children.  The South, the home is surrounded with love, laughter, restrictions and family.  Shared with their grandparents, the privilege of massaging grandmother&rsquo;s feet after she returns from daywork, put smiles on my face.  The children&rsquo;s anticipation of her stories, the author created this beautiful picture of this loving exchange between the generations.   Mother wants to create her own home and heads North, the children staying with the grandparents where they influence the children more as the South engrains more into their minds.  Jacqueline honesty and the ability to see the world through her eyes has me laughing and smiling as she sees and says things firsthand.  It&rsquo;s a story only Jacqueline can tell, for if anyone else were to tell the same story, it would not have the same effect.  It&rsquo;s a fantastic book, definitely worth reading once, twice or many times.

Beautifully told in verse, Woodson&rsquo;s story shares their triumphs of life and love of family. It&rsquo;s really a love letter to her family, whether it be good or bad, and a snapshot of her childhood life.
            Woodson doesn&rsquo;t hold any punches in her writings. She discusses without sugarcoating her religious upbringing in the Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses, her absentee father, her unwed mother and the surprise of a younger half white sibling and what his arrival meant to her family. Jackie&rsquo;s time in the South is marked by sit-ins, black&rsquo;s only restrooms, and the trying times her family endures when fighting for their own rights in this controversial period of American history.
            Gorgeously written, Woodson&rsquo;s story speaks to the human experience. Covering such taboo topics as religion, race, poverty, education, incarceration, death, sickness, unplanned pregnancies, learning disabilities, absentee parents and growing up. This story is so much more than a coming of age novel, it&rsquo;s a historical document testifying to our past and giving us hope for our future."
"Feed (Newsflesh Trilogy, #1)",0316081051,Mira Grant,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Snuffle_Shuffle,"Short version:   Overall a pretty good read (characters & plot pretty good); I enjoyed it, and it kept my interest. I would recommend it to people interested in zombies (as those depicted in popular zombie movies). If you don't like the classic zombies or are looking for a smarter or more intriguing depiction of zombies, you might find this book lacking a bit in that area though. 

Long Version:  I bought this book as a random selection after browsing the B&N shelves for about 15 minutes.  I like zombies, so I figured this book was worth a shot.  I was surprised it is such a new release for being a random pick on my part.

Overall I liked this book and was pleasantly surprised that it kept my attention and had interesting characters.  I enjoyed the dynamic between the two main characters, Georgia and Shaun, although I couldn't quite identify with their closeness to one another.  The other characters through out the book are interesting and well-created.  The book starts off great, but then became a little slow-going right after that for a short bit; it picked up nicely after that lull period though to produce an interesting story with some drama and thrill.  Overall though a pretty good pace throughout the book to keep interest, especially in the second half.

The only negatives I can comment on are that the writing style was a little repetitive at times, but only barely. A couple of the action scenes were introduced the same way, with something like ""I only barely had time to do whatever before the gun shots started"".  Not a big deal though.  I did kind of roll my eyes at the George Romero parts in the book, but I guess that's just the author's nod to zombie pop culture.  If you like zombies, you know who he is, but I was hoping this book was at least going to provide a new spin on zombies.  It didn't so much though, so I guess that's why I felt this book was slightly juvenile and less smart and savvy than I wanted it to be.

Lastly, I read the tidbits of the second book ""Blackout"", and I was a little put off by the amount of f-bombs dropped within the first few pages of that book.  I recognize it's based around a different character than the first book, but still I thought ""Feed"" was tasteful with the profanity, where as I don't know if ""Blackout"" will show the same tact.  The language issue though is just a personal preference kind of thing."
"Feed (Newsflesh Trilogy, #1)",0316081051,Mira Grant,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"If you are looking for a typical zombie novel this isn't it.  If you are looking for post-apacolyptic this isn't it either.  For these reasons I was somewhat disappointed in the book.  As others have pointed out it is a slow read, particularly in the beginning.  In Feed, there is a different take on the post-zombie world that really didn't do enough for my zombie tastes.  There is very little actual zombie in the book and very little struggle against zombies.  In this post-zombie world there is electricity, running water, airplanes, and basically all other advanced technology you can think of and many you can't as it is a much more advanced time technologically speaking.  People basically just ""live"" with zombies being out there somewhere on the other side of the electric fences.  People still go to work everyday, go out to dinner, etc living very much as they did before with some expected differences.  Virtually the only true threat is from people using the virus as a weapon or other living people dying around or near you because in this book anyone who dies can/will become a zombie.  Basically the virus is dormant in all living mammals of a certain size and can be triggered by certain biological events.  Most of the book is centered around making sure you aren't actively infected by requiring a blood test to do anything or go anywhere.  

So basically zombies and the post-zombie world are just a back drop for what could be called a thriller novel about the media and the evil right-wing politicos.  But a horror novel about zombies it is not which is why I was disappointed with it.  Overall it is an interesting premise about censorship of the media and politics and zombies but did not have enough violence, mayhem, horror, or zombie for me.  However, it did interest me enough that I will likely finish out the series but with a more realistic and different expectation of what I will read."
"Feed (Newsflesh Trilogy, #1)",0316081051,Mira Grant,Barnes and Noble,4.3,7hir7een,"Contrary to what one may think, Feed is not about zombies. To borrow a phrase from the novel itself, the zombies are there, but they&rsquo;re not the story. Instead, the story crafted is a gripping thriller, a chilling tale of bioterrorism, corruption, humanity, and most importantly, the fight for truth and the sacrifices necessary to achieve it. Mira Grant (Seanan McGuire) has created a masterpiece that aspires to many facets of greatness and successfully hits the mark in each case. Witty, heartfelt and relevant, Feed is one novel you won&rsquo;t regret picking up."
Icy Sparks,0142000205,Gwyn Hyman Rubio,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Lachelle Rivera,"I first this book some where around age 15-16 and i dont understand y ppl dont believe that a person can b bullied and ostracized that severly by both peers and adults well im hear to say from my own personal exp that it can happen! Throughout elementary school i was teased and picked on a lot by my peers and i didnt think it could get any worse until i reached sixth grade. I was sadly mistaken and any dreams of an easier time were shattered after the first week in school when i came to the conclusion that my sixth grade teacher hated me!!! Most ppl would see it as a child stretching it a bit much and go there's no way a teacher can hate you. Well mine did and i know this for a fact. Besides the little incidents throughout the year the worst thing she did 2 me was trying to keep me from going on our school's graduation because of my illness that kept me out of school a lot. But i had earned that trip i was the only child of my grade w/ a high b averge who spent about a quarter of the school year in the hospital. So as i was saying it is possible for things like what Icy Sparks went through to happen and for all of you who dont believe it, you need to open your eyes and remember there's a larger world out there than the place you live and not everyone grows up witj kind and adoring ppl around them comstantly"
Icy Sparks,0142000205,Gwyn Hyman Rubio,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"I loved this book!!! As a high school student it is fun to get away from the traditional books such as Huckleberry Finn. Don't get me wrong, that book wasn't horrible, but i felt it lacked emotion. I really felt that I understood what Icy was going through. The horrifying details of her symptoms and her surroundings will leave just about any reader swept off their feet. Read this book!!!"

Anne and Gilbert are (finally) married and move to, well, Anne's House of Dreams. This story is both deep, lighthearted, and funny. I savored every bit.

"The Templar Legacy (Cotton Malone, #1)",0345476166,Steve Berry,Barnes and Noble,3.9,CoCo-in-Wonderland,"Very good book for a summer beach read. If you liked Davinci Code, youll like this. This is my 1st Steve Berry book- it probably wont be my last. For those whom complained about historical accuracy try to remember this is FICTION so its not about accuracy- its about storyline, plot development & ENJOYMENT. The only thing that I didnt like about the book was that longer conversations between the characters should have had a few ""he said, she saids"" thrown in so the reader doesnt get lost because the tone of many of the characters are the same since they are all after the same thing. I had to go back a page a few times so I could get who was saying what."
"The Templar Legacy (Cotton Malone, #1)",0345476166,Steve Berry,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Rip_Walker,"Book Review:  The Templar Legacy - Steve Barry
My disclaimer: As with any opinion, it is only my opinion and these reviews will vary depending on who reads the book and what the reader is looking for. I look for ways to improve businesses, sales, and life.  I also like to feed my need for just plain fiction. In fiction, I'll look at readability, suspension of believe,  and over all enjoyment of the material, and value.

On a 1 to 5 scale, 5 being the best: 

Readability:  5    
It's  497 pages in paperback, and it took me about a week the book.  I usually read it a few chapters at a time, and it's what I expected. It flowed well and for the most part, was exciting to read. On few occasions it slowed, but that was expected as well. That's because some things just have to be explained and clarified. However, a great read and it won't disappoint you.
Suspension of belief: 5
The plot and story are very believable. There is no magic or arrival of the cavalry at the last moment to save the everyone.  Many things are realistic, for example, some clues for our characters are carved in stone, but some of the information has been destroyed by natural wear of the environment. Or, some people who might have helped our heroes, have died of natural causes over time. It's not a like an Indiana Jones movie where ancient artifacts are all perfectly intact. This just makes the story more believable.
Enjoyment of the Material and Value:  5  
At  about ten dollars it was well worth the value.  
This is an awesome religious thriller, and it is packed with great information. The information is somewhat controversial to the church, but it's not overly done and does not bash the church. A great read, a great story, and very interesting. Too bad they didn't teach history this way.
Thank you Steve Barry  for providing a great story!

I'm Rip Walker, thanks for watching!

"The Templar Legacy (Cotton Malone, #1)",0345476166,Steve Berry,Barnes and Noble,3.9,DCHightower,"This novel starts out a little slow, at least as far as the way I felt mentally getting involved with the plot, but it picks up steam. At the end it's like a runnaway train. It left me with a smile and a feeling that I was well entertained. The ending is a huge suprise. But you'll have to read it to discover it.

The Physick Book of Deliverance Dane,1401340903,Katherine Howe,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"I waited for this to become available at the library and when it was finally in my hands, I could not stop reading it.
The story alternates between the Salem Witch Trials and Connie Goodwin's, present day pursuit of her PhD at Harvard.
As Connie pursues her dissertation and researches a dissertaion topic, she is drawn to her own history in Marblehead and the links that her grandmother and mother, Grace, have to the past.
Connie begins to look for an old physick book that purportedly belonged to Deliverance Dane and while trying to find the antiquated book, she finds that she may have some exceptional witchy talents of her own.
If you have been to the Salem and Marblehead areas, there is such a sense of history there and one can really believe that the magical might exist today.
I totally enjoyed the book and recommend it highly."
The Physick Book of Deliverance Dane,1401340903,Katherine Howe,Barnes and Noble,3.9,kren250,"First, the good: I really liked the cover, especially the back flap that can be used to mark your page. A nice extra touch! I also think this book would be a great choice if you're looking for some escapism reading this summer. It's a fast and easy read that doesn't require much effort on the reader's part. It would be a nice book to take to the beach or the swimming pool.
 
Now, the bad: I thought the plot was very predictable; you can tell well in advance what is going to happen. This, unfortunately, turned me off the book early on, as I'm a person who likes to be surprised when reading this type of mystery/thriller book. Also, I did not find the main character very believable, mostly because she's a smart person yet misses so many obvious clues.

However, even though the book was not a hit for me, I'm glad I read it since I do think it will be a very popular book:-). It's always fun to see what all the hype is about. Thank you Barnes and Nobles First Look program for including me, and thank you to all (including Ms. Howe and the editor) who made it such an interesting discussion!"

"Deadhouse Gates (The Malazan Book of the Fallen, #2)",0765310023,Steven Erikson,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"The main players from Book 1, Gardens of the Moon, have split up. And this book follows the two Bridgeburners, Fiddler & Kalam as they go on their 'secret' mission, courtesy of the sly mind of Quick Ben. Along with them is Crokus, our lucky little thief, and Apsalar, the young fisherman's girl who's possession by Cotillion has still left her a cold-hearted killer. We also are introduced to Coltaine, the new fist, who's travails will become legend. And we meet Paran's younger sister, Felisin, who's own tale becomes the heart and soul of this book.     This book is gigantic, compared to the first one, but so layered, textured and terrific. Unlike the confusion that some may have had with following Gardens of the Moon with it's lack of set-up and so many characters, this book is much more left to develop plot, characters, and you feel completely along a fantastic ride as 3 tales are told and woven like a great tapestry. Felisin's journey, Coltaine's march, Fiddler/Kalam/Apsalar/Crokus's search...these 3 tales are powerful, riveting, and a more larger tale is beginning to unravel.    Book 2, though lacking the slam-bang ending of Gardens of the Moon, is a superior novel because of it's heart and soul. These are complex, troubled souls, admist a war and empire that is beginning to shake, and as the gods play their games, these humans and creatures set the stage of whatis to come...and in fact, seem to control the playing field in more than the gods do."

Elizabeth Is Missing,0062309668,Emma Healey,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"As a physician, I have cared for hundreds of Alzheimers patients from the time they were whole to the end of there disease.   This book does not explain the disease,  instead you live the illness with the protagonist as she slowly loses chunks of herself while finding chunks of a loss.  It is mesmerizing to read as someone so smoothly morphs from  today to 70 years ago.  You care deeply about this woman and you feel her sorrow and confusion.  The tender care of her daughter and the angst she must feel is skillfully expressed through the mother.  At heart is a mystery, a whodunit but the most interesting take on that genre I have ever read."
Elizabeth Is Missing,0062309668,Emma Healey,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"Unbelievably well done, especially considering that this is the author's first book. The description of Maud's descent into dementia was incredibly realistic. All the characters were fully fleshed out and the London setting was very believable and added immensely to the overall story. Would not hesitate to buy the author's next book or to recommend this book to others. Great! WOW!"
Elizabeth Is Missing,0062309668,Emma Healey,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Twink,"One of the best things about my job is being asked &quot;What have you read that's really good lately?&quot; Well, Emma Healey's debut novel, Elizabeth is Missing, is one title I'll be recommending over and over again this summer. I really, really loved this book. Okay, you loved it Luanne, now what's it about?

 Maud is in her eighties and is slowly but surely losing her memory, her ability to live alone and  to take care of herself. But the one thing she cannot forget is her friend Elizabeth. Maud is convinced she is missing, no matter what her daughter Helen, her carers and Elizabeth's son Peter says. She need to find her - Elizabeth is missing. Maud writes many notes to remind herself to continue to look for Elizabeth. And she does, putting herself in harm's way and her daughter at her wit's end.

 But there is a second narrative as well, from Maud's past as a young girl in Britain, shortly after World II has ended.  Maud is an unreliable narrator. As the past and the present become tangled in Maud's memory, the reader is not quite sure of what is truth, what is memory and what is what might have been. But as I read, I had suspicions creeping in......

 It is difficult to watch Maud struggle with knowing she is losing her memory. She is determined to hand on to her pride, her dignity and independence. And desperate to know what has happened to Elizabeth. Healey's writing captures Maud's frustration, the lost time and the fear so well. But Healey does inject humour into Maud's life as well. She is a feisty soul. Her daughter Helen is just as well drawn and provides a real and touching look at the difficult, often painful role of being a child and/or a carer of someone with dementia or Alzheimer's. I thought Helen's granddaughter Katy was very well written as well. She jokes and laughs with her grandmother and loves her very much. I wonder if there's a bit of Healey written into Katy.

 Elizabeth is missing is both a mystery and a story of lives, heartbreaking, yet life affirming. Above all, it is a brilliant read, guaranteed to grab you and not let you go, even after the last page is turned. (have a tissue handy) Part of what made this book so poignant was Healey adding in part of her life and memories, with a nod to her grandmothers, Nancy and Vera.

 &quot;It was a few months after she (Nancy) died, that I began to write Elizabeth is Missing in earnest, combining the exploration of dementia prompted by Nancy with some of the stories I'd collected from Vera.&quot;

As I read, I too thought often of my own grandmothers, now both passed away. And it made me love the book even more."

The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August,0316399620,Claire North,Barnes and Noble,4.5,cloggiedownunder,"The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August is a novel by British author Clair North (a pseudonym used by Catherine Webb). Harry August is a kalachakra, one of a collection of extraordinary individuals who die, only to be reborn at exactly the same moment in history, to live parallel lives that loop perpetually through the same course of historical events, although experiencing changes within their own lives. Harry is even more unusual in that he has a perfect memory, accurately recalling the details of each of his previous lives when he is reborn. The reader meets Harry at the end of his eleventh life, when he is visited by a young girl needing him to take a message back in time, an urgent message about the end of the world. Throughout the book, the narration skips back and forth between the events of Harry&rsquo;s next few lives and those of past lives that are relevant to the course of action he decides to take. North has written an ambitious novel that achieves everything it sets out to do. Her hero is likeable, all the more so because he is flawed and succumbs to temptation. In Harry&rsquo;s many lives, he does much good, but he also gambles quite a lot, becomes a criminal mastermind, commits cold-blooded murder, suicides several times and admits his actions have cost the lives of many kalachakra. North&rsquo;s extensive research into recent historical events is apparent in every chapter. As well as exploring the age-old themes of time travel and the effects of changing the past, she examines the effect on a person&rsquo;s behaviour of knowing that their death is not final. Navigating the next life with the knowledge gained in previous lives may sound ideal (if I only knew then what I know now!), but Harry proves that it is not quite as successful as one might hope. This is a brilliant novel with a highly original plot and a great climax. Readers will look forward to more from Claire North."
The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August,0316399620,Claire North,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Nathan_Winssinger,"Brilliant, smart, and engaging, it's a mind-tormenting piece of literature. More than fantasy or scifi, it's a novel about history, the pursuit of knowledge and of happiness, and what makes us human (and flawed). Elegant and sophisticated, complex and erudite. A real gem."
The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August,0316399620,Claire North,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Wildflowers,"The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August by Claire North is a hard science fiction novel and one of the strangest books I have ever read. Yet, the central character, gripping stories that deal with the intricacies and absurdities of time travel and the deft writing of the author makes it an enjoyable read.

How would you live if you had your life to live over and over again? Will you consider it a blessing or a curse? Perhaps, both! Harry August is a man with many lives, literally. Every time he dies, he is born again with the ability to recall all his previous life, without missing even a simple dot. With it a he has a chance to redeem himself, correct mistakes in his previous life, and make a fresh start. But can a new beginning be possible when the past is as clear as daylight?

It seems appealing enough yet to start again where it all began, and the same process repeated over and over again is not my idea of life. As Harry August is facing the inevitable prospect of dying during one of his many lives, he is told that the world is ending and is assigned the onerous task of finding out why, no matter how many lives it takes. By the end of the story, I'm grateful that we all die once, and do not have to face the same sort of cycle like Harry August in the book. Death, it appears, is a glorious thing, an end to human misery, pain and suffering. The Fifteen Lives of Harry August is also a story of friendship and betrayal, loyalty and redemption, love and loneliness and the inescapable march of time."
The Guns of August,0345476093,"Barbara W. Tuchman, Robert K. Massie",Barnes and Noble,4.1,B-2,"This is a serious, scholarly book about the beginning of WWI. It is written as a ""big picture"" : a lot of high diplomacy, geopolitics and large scale army movements . Perfect for an armchair general, but somewhat difficult for rest of us - civilian schpaks.  Nevertheless, it gives a general reader like myself a very distinct ""feel"" of the time : including incredible misconceptions and mis-forecasts of all participants about the coming war , madness of kings and field-marshalls and common folks too, the devastation, and the feeling that the worst is yet to come.  One criticism is lack of really comprehensive maps, the authors maps are realy schematic and the editors should consider additional ones to help the people reading the book 100 years after the events understand them better.                
 I grade the books as Buy and Keep (BK), Read Library book and Return ( RLR) and Once I Put it Down I Couldn't Pick it Up ( OIPD-ICPU). This one is BK if you are really interested in that time, and OIPD-ICPU if you are not."
The Guns of August,0345476093,"Barbara W. Tuchman, Robert K. Massie",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"First of all I consider Tuchman not only a first rate historian but but also a first rate writer,comparable perhaps only to Robert K. Massie (Castles of Steel,Dreadnought).This is one book that shows the true tragedy of the summer of 1914 when the Great Powers of Europe blindly stumbled into a murderous war costing millions of soldiers' lives and also civilians' in the 1918 influenza pandemic where the malnourished German population was decimated.  The generals leading the operations are not portrayed as 'donkeys leading the lions',but simply as technically not up to date 19th century men not realizing that the heroic ways of offensive warfare did not work against machine guns and quickfiring artillery. Younger Moltke learned this -Joffre and Haig did not.These men did not know that the minimal infantry numbers of Frederick,Moltke,and even Napoleon were supplanted by huge masses of infatry which could not perform the Prussian charges nor Maneuvres sur derriere of Napoleon but needed huge logistics tails which Schlieffen conveniently neglected in his Great Memorandum considering his war of movement and rigid time tables proposed. The innovative way of waging war was fought at sea considering the distant blockade,the U boat war and the defense against it.Jutland was not that innovative although the charge of caution against Jellicoe was unjust since he won the battle strategically.   Tuchman describes the initial war of movement before it ground to a halt. She treats Molke the Yonger as what he was a physically sick old man out his depth trying to do the best he could.  Of course this book is a classic.Why not? It should be."
The Guns of August,0345476093,"Barbara W. Tuchman, Robert K. Massie",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"Barbara Tuchman's account of the first two months of World War I is written in a narrative style that puts real faces (glorious as well as shady) on the individuals who are so often lost in the trenches of historical writing. One is amazed at how seemingly trivial events combined with underlying factors would, in less than a month, lead to the destruction and rebirth of the world. An entire generation of young men would be lost by the decisions made by a few. Unlike how the war is usually presented, these choices were not easy ones, whether for Poincare or the Kaiser, and all parties involved slept little until the very last minute of peace. The same emotions courses through the reader at every turn of the page as the mind absorbs the history as if it has countered it for the first time. Barbara Tuchman is also very fair in her views of the leading characters in the unfolding drama. True, many generals were incompetent, throwing entire populations at each other in an attempt to outmaneuver the enemy and win a glorious victory in the style of Napoleon of Bismarck. However, they were human, and one can empathize with the meloncholy felt by Sir French, the sense of inevitability felt by King Albert, and the crushing affect of past parental achievements on the mind of von Moltke. At times, though, one may feel that Shakespeare said it best through the mouth of Puck: 'What fools these mortals be!' The many, missed opportunities for a completely different and benevolent future stings us with the same impact of a failed field goal that would've won the NBA finals. This book is closest to some real-time experience of World War I that one can get, and quite frankly a lengthier work describing the entire war will be too exhausting. I have never read a history book as this one; more 'strategic' than Stephen Ambrose but more 'tactical' than Gilbert Martin. Barbara Tuchman is a truly unique writer."
"Separation of Power (Mitch Rapp, #5)",0671047345,Vince Flynn,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,Vince Flynn does a terrific job of moving the action/plot without sending you in too many directions.  I'm a female who only reads romance.  His books are captivating and fast moving.  He does a superlative job!!  I've read five of his books and I can't wait for the next one.
"Separation of Power (Mitch Rapp, #5)",0671047345,Vince Flynn,Barnes and Noble,4.3,harstan,"He had been in power for so long that he owned presidents, but now CIA Director Thomas Stansfeld is dead and much of DC celebrates.  The festive mood changes to horror when the realization begins to surface that Stansfeld¿s top assistant, Dr. Irene Kennedy is his most likely replacement.  Her opposition has set in motion powerful plans to wreck any permanent appointment of Kennedy.    However, Kennedy¿s biggest problem is that her star assassin Mitch Rapp wants out as soon as he completes his final mission.  Soon Mitch learns that Iraq is closing in on nuclear weaponry that Saddam protects beneath a hospital cover.  Mitch will lead the assault team on the facility knowing that if he fails the Israelis will follow and a wider war will ensue.  In spite of the stakes, the extreme elements opposed to Kennedy getting the top CIA job including links to the Halls of Congress will do anything to make Mitch fail even if World War III occurs.      The follow up to THE THIRD OPTION, SEPARATION OF POWER, is a tremendous espionage thriller that never slows down for even a moment.  The story line is action-packed and Mitch is what we need right now in Afghanistan even if he wants to retire.  Though some of the actions of the anti-Kennedy group seem bizarre when weighed against the cost, many readers will look at real terrorist acts and think nothing much of the anti-Kennedy crowd, sad as that seems.  Once again, Vince Flynn provides a strong espionage thriller that makes this author the prime option of choice for genre fans.    Harriet Klausner"

"Tomorrow, When the War Began (Tomorrow, #1)",0439829100,John Marsden,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"although they never tell you which country invades them, this is a great wild ride.  Kids leave to go camping in the wildnerness and come back to everyone they love having been captured.  It is a little dated at first b/c it's pre-smart phone / cell phone and my first instinct was 'why didn't they go online to find out' but other than that it was great.  teens get it together and save the world.  Really enjoyed it and it led you right into the next one...I read all seven back to back and still wanted more but you can't get the Ellie Chronicles (what happens after the war) for Nook and they didn't have them in-store to purchase.  If you like the Hunger Games, you'll enjoy this."
"Tomorrow, When the War Began (Tomorrow, #1)",0439829100,John Marsden,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Stellar7blue,"Billeted as Y/A, the narration and plot provide an astute insight into war and occupation on homeland soil. The back-stories of multiple characters only adds to it's richness as they cope with challenges of war and strife, their own maturity, what is asked of them, what they overestimate, and how they negotiate with their evolving self and ideals. It's not about complete character assassination, rather hope and choosing to fight for a life and it's sustaining values.

As a social worker that worked in inner city medical trauma, I found this book to even be a turning point personally and clinically in my work. I highly recommend it. Heck, I married the man who lent it to me! It was a good discussion point for us about values, pragmatics/idealism, and military (he's military)."
"Tomorrow, When the War Began (Tomorrow, #1)",0439829100,John Marsden,Barnes and Noble,4.3,THHernandez,"There are not enough words to adequately describe how MUCH I love this book. It&rsquo;s intense, and thrilling, emotional, raw, witty&hellip;everything I love in a book and more. The story is set in Australia, where a group of teens decide to take one last camping trip before school starts back up. While camping deep in the bush, their country is overtaken by an enemy that is never fully defined, but that feeds the plot so perfectly. And because the teens don&rsquo;t know who is behind it, neither does the reader.

As the reality of what has happened slowly dawns on Ellie and her friends, a chill washes over the reader. It is so utterly believable that you can&rsquo;t help but get caught up in the story, feel the initial shock and growing fear as they realize everyone they love is gone, their pets dead, and they have no idea what has happened.

Slowly they put the pieces together and decide to fight back, first against their own fears, and then against the enemy. The emotion that John Marsden brings to the story is authentic. As a high school teacher, he has a deep understanding of the teenage mind and draws his characters so beautifully real that it&rsquo;s hard to remember they&rsquo;re fictional.

Plot
The characters deal with the realities of life in a country ripped from under them and the ugly realities of war. They&rsquo;re the only ones left to do something, and yet nothing in their lives has prepared them for it. The story starts off a little slow, but not haltingly so. John Marsden beautifully sets up his pivotal moment, building to the unfolding horror like a steady climb up the steps of Hell, where the kids have been camping. And then it takes off at breakneck speed, from one intense moment to the next, allowing us only small moments to catch our breath.

I think what I love best about this story is the way the characters are so deeply affected by what has happened and what they have to do. So many stories of this nature have the characters deal with emotions in the moment, but there never seems to be any lasting damage from the events. Often, characters are broken by what happened before the story starts and play into the character arcs. But in Tomorrow When the War Began, the characters are profoundly affected by what they need to do, and we see them break before our eyes.

Characters
The characters are what really make this book what it is. Yes, it has a pulse-pounding plot, but the nuanced complexities of Ellie, Homer, Fi, Robyn, Corrie, Lee and Chris take the story from just a thriller to something so much deeper. Ellie is a fun-loving only child who considers her friends to be family. The way she adores her friends makes me adore her even when she&rsquo;s getting on my last nerve.

Homer is the guy I want to hang out with, the one I want as my best friend. He&rsquo;s a crazy Greek with streak for getting into trouble, but would never abandon you in the thick of things. He&rsquo;s definitely the guy you want along on your camping trip or an attack on an unknown enemy.

Corrie is Ellie&rsquo;s best mate, the one she&rsquo;d do anything for. Their relationship is at the heart of the story and ultimately the most emotional and heartbreakingly real. Corrie stands by Ellie when Ellie snaps and alienates everyone else, but she does it with love and a touch of humor.

Robyn is sweet and principled and is constantly finding those principles put to the test. Standing by her long-held beliefs or standing by her friends is a battle she fights nearly every day and it&rsquo;s both painful and satisfying watching her grow.

Fiona, or Fi, is the sweet, wholesome, rich girl from town hanging out with the &ldquo;rural inbreds&rdquo; and she&rsquo;s so clearly out of her element that most of the comic relief is at her expense, but she takes it with grace.

Chris is the town stoner, but he&rsquo;s no Jeff Spicoli. Chris is far deeper than I originally thought and the more I learn about him, the more I like him.

And finally, there&rsquo;s Lee. What can I say about Lee except that I love him. So completely and truly. He&rsquo;s a musician and the only one of the group who the others don&rsquo;t really know. Ellie invites him along as a last choice because she finds him &ldquo;interesting.&rdquo; He ultimately becomes her love interest, but he&rsquo;s much more than that. Lee is the center to Ellie&rsquo;s craziness. He&rsquo;s willing to do what needs to be done, regardless of how awful he finds it. He&rsquo;s not immune to the consequences of their actions, but he understands better than the others that war sometimes means difficult choices and that beating yourself up constantly over those choices isn&rsquo;t prudent.

Bottom Line
Tomorrow When the War Began is probably the best young adult dystopian novel you&rsquo;ve never read. John Marsden has created a totally believable and horrifying world and plunked his complex characters into it to play out a what-if scenario that is brilliant on so many levels. The fact that it is just the first book in a series, and that I read the entire ten-book series in under three months, is a testament to how incredibly much I love the Tomorrow series."
"The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves, and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History",1599951495,"Robert M. Edsel, Bret Witter",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Robdesign,"This is probably one of the best kept secrets of WW II, until now.  The brave men and women, many directly from the world of the arts, who put their lives on the line to save the art of the world from the Nazi's. 

Written from interviews of surving members, journals and a great deal of deep and thorough reasearch, this book puts you in the Jeep right with the solidiers searching for the great artworks of the world pilfered by the Nazis.  

Extermely well-written and extremely well-paced for a history book, it's a journey that will educate the reader as well as entertain them as they route on the good guys as the race against time, military ignorance and of course, WWII, to make their mission a successful one.  It is a book that is hard to put down.  Quite impressive in my mind for a history book. 

If you are a fan of history, particularly WWII, this is a must read. It's a part of the story that never got out until way after the war. And to honor those who gave so much, reading this book is the least we can do for these patriots."
"The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves, and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History",1599951495,"Robert M. Edsel, Bret Witter",Barnes and Noble,3.9,peakbagger06,"It's amazing that the US armed forces with the prompting of US artists, curators, architects and restorers saved an unimaginable # of Europe's great paintings, architecture, books, municipal documents etc with an amazingly small number of people.

The character development reads like a novel. Edsel's writing creates an environment where we warm up to even the most stoic of character's such as Rose Valland, female Jeu De Paume spy. 

Many anecdotes to keep the book interesting.

If you didn't already have a deep loathing for Nazi commanders for their inhumanity to Jews and their own populace, you will after you read about the greed Goring, Hitler and others demonstrated in their art grab in France, Belgium, Germany etc.

And to think, these men were never recognized by Congress in 2007 until only a handful were still living. To this day most Americans have no idea of Eisenhower's art philosophy and edict to save monuments and the dedicated, knowledgable men who carried out these tedious, dangerous feats. Kudos!"
"The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves, and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History",1599951495,"Robert M. Edsel, Bret Witter",Barnes and Noble,3.9,lilyann530,"This is a great book. I wondered if it would capture my attention because I am not normally an avid reader of WWII books. However, there is a lot more to this story that will appeal to a broad audience, especially women. The author included excerpts of letters that the Monuments Men wrote their wives and families...they are beautiful and sometimes heart wrenching. This story provides an entirely new way to look at WWII as it explores the Nazis' obsession with and theft of art from across Europe, and almost more interestingly, the Monuments Men's efforts to locate it. As the title suggests, the book focuses on the Monuments Men themselves, and is a ""people"" story, not a broad exploration of the entire subject of Nazi looting and art repatriation."
Love Letters to the Dead,0374346674,Ava Dellaira,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Caroles_Random_Life,"Wonderful YA novel!

In the interest of full disclosure, I received a copy of this book at no cost from the publisher for review purposes.

5 Stars!

I just loved this book. Even though I was a teenager half my life ago, this book is one of the reasons I still choose to read YA novels. There are no silly sparkly vampires seen here. There is really nothing sparkly seen here at all. This book is real. This book makes the reader feel.

Laurel is just entering a high school at a new school. She is given an assignment in her English class of writing a letter to a person who is dead. While Laurel never turns in her assignment, she spends that year writing letters to famous dead people as a way of journaling her very troubled life. Through the letters, the reader learns everything that troubles Laurel but we learn them piece by piece. The biggest piece is the loss of her older sister and the subsequent effect on her family. Many pieces of the story do not come until the end of the book when Laurel is ready to deal with them. We watch her deal with pain and grief in stages as she is ready.

The letters are address to people that I know well since I am older than the intended audience. I do wonder if the average teen reader will know who Kurt Cobain, Jim Morrison, River Phoenix and Janis Joplin are and whether than will have any effect on their enjoyment of the book. This book will probably be best for an older teen as drinking, drugs, and sex (plus other sensitive topics) are part of the story.

We do see Laurel grow and deal with everything that has happened in her life. I have hope for her future. This is a story of a girl having the strength to overcome what life has thrown at her."
Love Letters to the Dead,0374346674,Ava Dellaira,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"This book is one that will.. well.. it will make you laugh, cry, and quote it like crazy. Laurel is a well developed character that will make you form a close bond with her and see her through many different perspectives. I personally enjoy her realizations about different people through out the book. It makes her seem real because the author is putting so much detail into modern highschool events. Her writing style is full of metaphors and comparisons both morbid and beautiful. The author's idea of a freshman turning a writing assignment into a way to let her emotions out is lovely idea. Im expecting more successful work from her for yeats to come."
Love Letters to the Dead,0374346674,Ava Dellaira,Barnes and Noble,4.2,book4children,"I was super excited to read this book. The cover is gorgeous and the blurb sounds really interesting. At first, it was everything I had been hoping for. Laurel is writing letters to dead celebrities as she tries to figure out her life. She is trying to cope with the fact that her mom ran away and her sister died. She's at a new school and makes some new friends. The writing is gorgeous and full of emotion. I love the way Laurel describes things, like the way she feels connected to the music of dead singers, or the performances of dead actors.

About half way through, I started to lose interest. The beginning was so awesome, but then the same things kept getting rehashed over and over. The writing was still beautiful, and I really enjoyed Laurel's relationship with the dead people she keeps writing to. But the story had somehow lost it's spark for me. I didn't feel like I connected with the characters all that much. They were all pretty quirky, which isn't a bad thing, but it just wasn't MY thing.

I'm not a teenager, so maybe that had something to do with it, but I can't be certain that I would have connected with the book even if I were a teenager. I'm chalking this one up to personal taste, because it really is a beautifully written book.

Content: This one has a LOT of content. Underage drinking, sex between underage teens and older guys, drugs, smoking, passionate make out sessions with and without clothes, and quite a bit of language. Far too many F-words for my tastes.

The Cover: I adore this cover! It is so gorgeous and it portrays the feel of this book really well. The cover was definitely a huge plus for me."

"Divine Justice (Camel Club, #4)",0446195502,David Baldacci,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,If you are going to sell the paperback version of Devine Justice for $4.99 then you really shouldn't be selling the e-book version for $14.99 It dosn't make sense.

With each one, I fear that the Camel Club story will come to an end.  With the rich characters of the Camel CLub already a part of my literary family, I am hopeful that John Knox will be become a part of the Camel Club in the same way that Alex Ford and Annabelle have.  I think what I enjoy most is that such diverse personalities have joined together and formed such strong bonds of friendship.  The fact that the stories surround Washington, DC either directly or indirectly parallel our own fascination with politics and politicians and the people who often suffer because of what they have sacrificed for their country.  Please continue this series.  In much the same way as the Sean King and Michelle Maxwell stories, I never hesitate to pick up the latest book involving the Camel Club."

I am a fan Millar's gritty look at at the world of comic book heros and Romita Jr's art storytelling is great. Overall a quick read, nicely paced with action. If handled like the comic, I think the movie adaption will be fun. I noticed it has an R rating so that's a good start."

The book is very much placed in the 21st century, with modern culture and comic book references throughout.  Half the book is a dark, twisted comedy, and the other half is a dark, twisted drama.  Ideal for people who would get nerd in-jokes and with offbeat senses of humor."
Left to Tell: Discovering God Amidst the Rwandan Holocaust,1401908977,"Immaculée Ilibagiza, Steve Erwin",Barnes and Noble,4.7,Anonymous,"I was a little hesitant to read this book because sometimes these stories can be horrible. But the story of this woman's faith and strength has touched my heart. 

Immaculee was raised in an educated home without prejudice. Her parents were generous people, helping people of all races and religious beliefs that they came in contact with. Her father was active in seeking out peaceful solutions for Rwanda's political discord. As a youth she was not even aware of a difference in tribal people. The first time she had to stand for an ethnic roll call in her public school she had no idea what tribe she belonged to. As it turned out she was a Titsu.

While on Easter Break from her University in 1994 the exiled Titsu rebel army attacked the Hutu tribe in hopes of being able to return to Rwanda and their families. In retaliation the Hutu's formed a killing militia that was soon out of control killing every known titsu they could find. Immaculee lost all of her family members except one brother who was out of the country studying. 

Imaculee sought refuge with a local Hutu minister. He hid her and 6 other woman in a small bathroom (3ft x 4ft) at the back of his house. He slid an armoire in front of the door to hide it. Many times the killers searched the home, accusing him of harboring Titsu's. These women were able to stay quiet and lived in this state for 91 days. The minister would bring them table scraps to share, this was their only food. Immaculee lost 40 lbs. while she was hidden. The women developed a sign language so they could communicate with each other. To relieve their cramping muscles they worked out a rotation system. I just cannot even fathom surviving such a physical ordeal, never mind the mental duress of being hidden, hunted, and worrying about loved ones. 

In this book Immaculee acknowledges the horror and atrocities of the holocaust but does not dwell on them. Instead she writes a story of how she strengthened her relationship with God through faith and prayer. She learned to forgive her enemies and gained a profound understanding of mankind. She prayed to know why she had been spared. She was granted a vision to prepare her for her return to the civilized world. During the course of her ""captivity"" she borrowed all the English books the minister had and learned to speak and read English. She knew from her vision she would one day be working at the UN helping Rwanden victims, and she would be translating for them. She would pray for understanding as she read the words; it is so amazing to me that she could discipline herself to this extent while her world was falling apart. 

I have been profoundly touched by this woman's story and example."

Left to Tell: Discovering God Amidst the Rwandan Holocaust,1401908977,"Immaculée Ilibagiza, Steve Erwin",Barnes and Noble,4.7,Guest,"In 1994, a 22 year old Rwandan native was home from   college to enjoy Easter with her family in Mataba. She and   her family are devout Catholics and members of a local   tribe known as Tutsis.  However, the joys of a long   awaited visit to home were cut short when the President of   Rwanda, born Hutu, was murdered near the capital city of   Kigali. Accusations flew as the entire Tutsi population was   blamed and punished for the offense. Genocide,   prejudice, and racism became preeminent ways of life for   the people of Rwanda as the Tutsi civilians were literally   hacked into submission by the Hutu extremists.  Left to   Tell is a first-hand account of Immaculee Ilibagiza who is   one of the few survivors of the Rwandan genocide. From   news of sadistic torture and murder surrounding her loved   ones to her family to realizing an innate connection with   an ever-loving God, Left to Tell teaches the reader two   very important lessons. Firstly, Ilibagiza¿s description of   theatrocities committed towards her people prove how   misused governmental influence can drive people of the   gentlest nature to hatred and crime. Secondly, her   experience with prayer and faith in God proves that we are   never alone and that even in the darkest of times you will   always have hope. These two elements are perfectly   intwined one with another to ultimately prove that   unconditional forgiveness can overcome pain and   anguish. Through the experiences of this beautiful young   women who survived the Rwandan genocide we can learn   imperative truths and lessons about life and overcoming   adversity."
"Plague (Gone, #4)",0061449121,Michael  Grant,Barnes and Noble,4.6,IceyBooks,"My reaction after I read the last line of Plague? I was speechless, is all I can say. All you need to know is that I am DYING to read the fifth book, when the fourth hasn't even been released yet.
  But you need to know more, don't you? Michael Grant's writing style is unique in every way. Believe me when I put him right next to JK Rowling. He belongs there. And I mean it.
  For those of you who have read the first three books in the Gone series, you are well aware of the many different things happening at once. Every one and a half to two pages of so, we leave one character hanging from a cliff and run of to another. And its not just two of them. There are about four or five different things going on at once and in the end, everything ties together in one perfect ending. To me, that's beyond words (as you can tell from my weak explanation). To me, that's sheer genius.
   In the latest installment of the Gone series, Sam and the kids in the FAYZ are far from content. Water is scarce, a horrifying sickness is spreading, and mutilating, sickening bugs are hatching out of human bodies. That's right, hatching out of the kids - and they can't even feel a thing. 
   Sam, with some of Perdido Beach's best fighters, is sent to scout for water, while Astrid is contemplating murder, and Caine is living luxuriously on the island. But of course, this is the FAYZ, nothing lasts long. 
   Heart pounding, thrilling, and all-around unputdownable, Plague is a masterpiece."
"Plague (Gone, #4)",0061449121,Michael  Grant,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"I love this series! Its almost like the hunger games, except not as violent. But still, this book is kinda dark. I love all the characters and the plot line, but it  just feels like the characters have turned into different people. Take Lana, for example. She was so much kinder and sweeter in the first book. Now shes a different person. Shes so bitter and she doesnt like people anymore. I know why, and I know this is to be expected, but it still makes me so sad. And Sam and Astrid have changed a lot too. But all in all, this has become one of my favorite series (and believe me, it is not easy to earn that title). It has a good plotline, and it leaves you begging for more. At the end of every chapter, you are almost shaking with anticipation. I suggest this book for teens into the hunger games and dystopion society stuff. Im already waiting the next book!"

A God in Ruins,0316176532,Kate Atkinson,Barnes and Noble,3.9,cloggiedownunder,"A God in Ruins is a book of the Todd Family by award-winning British author, Kate Atkinson. Teddy Todd: younger brother of Ursula, favourite son of Sylvie, model for his Aunt Izzie’s best-selling books, the young man whose life was cut short when he was shot down over Germany in 1944. Or not. During that dreadful war, Teddy never thought about the future: as a bomber pilot flying missions over Germany, he didn’t expect to have one. 

When he came home as an ex-POW in 1945, a hero, he suddenly, quite unexpectedly, did have a future in front of him. A career (not in his father’s bank, please!), a wife, fatherhood, grandchildren: all were ahead of him in the latter half of the twentieth century.  

Teddy’s war experience plays a large part in the novel, as it does in his life. But Teddy is not the only narrator of his tale: his parents, his siblings, his spouse, his child and his grandchildren all add to the story of Teddy’s unexpected life from their own perspective. 

Once again Atkinson gives the reader a set of wholly believable characters, flawed but nonetheless appealing, and their reactions to the challenges life throws at them are natural and credible. And perhaps even the nasty ones have their reasons. There is plenty of humour to counter the lump-in-the-throat moments, and the irony of Ursula’s opinion on reincarnation is quite delicious. And again, Atkinson’s extensive research is apparent in every chapter.

A God in Ruins is a companion volume to Atkinson’s earlier Todd Family book and, while it is not necessary to have read Life After Life before reading A God in Ruins, there are so many common characters, events and objects that the reader who has done so will be delighted to once again encounter old friends. Another brilliant Atkinson novel! Recommended."

"Magic Study (Study, #2)",0373802498,Maria V. Snyder,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"Magic Study is almost as good as its predecessor.  I liked how the author put together some loose ends without wrapping up the entire story.  I like the mystery mixed with fantasy and romance.  That was the only thing that I wanted more of in this book, more Yelena and Valek time."
"Magic Study (Study, #2)",0373802498,Maria V. Snyder,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Sensitivemuse,"This book was so interesting I would get irritated each time there would be interruptions to my reading. It was that good. I had to keep reading until the final page. I just had to. If you thought Poison Study was good, Magic Study gets even better.

Yelena is thrown into a brand new situation, and now has to re-adjust accordingly. This brings about a new set of characters, a good solid character development within Yelena, and more Valek (my favorite part!). As in the previous novel, there's mystery and intrigue thrown into the story but the mystery aspect of the book is more violent and much darker than Poison Study. The romance between Yelena and Valek is still there, and it was nice to see them together as they do compliment each other well as a couple. There was an interesting chemistry between Yelena and Cahil - although Cahil acted like a spoiled selfish brat in the end and that does pave the way towards the third book. 

It was nice to see Ari and Jaco back, and while they were out of the picture, Yelena's horse Kiki provided some of the comic relief. It was also nice to see Yelena hasn't really changed, although I did notice she had really great comebacks and her wit was still there, sharp as ever. I enjoyed the connection between Kiki and Yelena. Better yet, Kiki's requests for peppermints and apples always generated a smile from me. 

I'm not sure if I like Leif or not. I hated him at first because of his treatment of Yelena, and once you found out his dirty little secret, I still hated him even more. As his behavior changed, I'm still not sure what to think about him. I'd have to say, all the characters in the books are very well done and each one memorable so they're not just any character that you'll forget later as you progress further into the book. They had distinct personalities which helps to memorize who is who (as the cast in this book is a bit big). 

The fantasy aspect of the book is good and the magic is easy to understand. I liked how characters had a specific specialization in a certain aspect of magic - in that way they're not too overpowered and they have their weaknesses as well. Yelena seems to be the jack of all trades when it comes to magic but her talents also has risks and consequences as well.

Magic Study did live up to its predecessor and achieved more. It had an interesting plot filled with mystery, fantasy, and intrigue but it also featured well written memorable characters (horses included!). The ending prepares the reader for the third book and I'm definitely going to be reading that one soon."

Her first disappointment comes when her brother Leif thinks she is an lxian spy.

Yelena¿s magic is powerful and doesn¿t always work the way it is supposed to because she lacks experience and training.  Her lover in Ixia, Valek, second only to the leader Commander Ambrose journeys into Sitia as part of the delegation and since he is immune to magic he is the perfect person to save her from two kidnappers and an attempt on her life.  However, to save the life of an innocent, Yelena must risk everything.

"Chobits, Vol. 1",1931514925,"CLAMP, Shirley Kubo",Barnes and Noble,4.8,Guest,"I won't bother repeating what everybody   else has said.. ok, maybe I will.  Chobits is good.  There's something for everyone - art,   story, action, character development,   romance, comedy, and a pinch of ecchi   for.. uh.. for whatever reason.  Need I say more?  Also worth mentioning, is that several   volumes end in cliffhangers (2, 4, and 7 if   I remember correctly).  Not exactly the   best thing, if you can't get them all   immediately.."

"Chobits, Vol. 1",1931514925,"CLAMP, Shirley Kubo",Barnes and Noble,4.8,Jenson_AKA_DL on LibraryThing,"Hideki is a college student, struggling to make ends meet and more than anything wishes he was able to afford a persocom android to make his life easier.  As luck would have it Hideki stumbles upon a persocom which was apparently thrown out with the trash.  At first Hideki is sure fate has tricked him as ""Chi"" (the persocom) doesn't appear to have any sort of operating system or programing.  However, soon Hideki begins to expect that instead of a mere persocom he may have found a Chobit, a super-computer capable of teaching herself.I very much enjoyed this manga.  Chi is absolutely adorable and Hideki's constant flux between trying to be decent and fighting his baser urges is comical.  In comparison with other mangas I have read the story was exceptionally easy to follow and the artwork, especially of the persocoms, is simply beautiful.  Some of the subject matter is a little on the more mature side and I certainly agree with the ""Older Teen"" rating for this manga.  Other than that I would highly recommend this story!"
Battle Royale,156931778X,"Koushun Takami, Yuji Oniki",Barnes and Noble,4.6,JayJason,"Dear all fans of the Hunger Games (both the book and the movie),

Don't you just love the Hunger Games? Let's look back at a great parts. Remember that time when Katniss and Peeta got attacked by a tribute that had gone insane? Yeah, and then Katniss and the tribute went tumbling down the hill. But when they made it to the bottom of the hill the tribute had his hatchet lodged in his head. Then Rue saw Katnis standing over the dead body, and thought that Katniss was a brutal killer. Remember that? No? That's probably because that didn't happen in the Hunger Games. It happened in Battle Royale (with different characters, of course). 

It pains me to say I picked up Battle Royale because of the whole BR-HG dispute. I'd already read HG, and I wanted to see how it stacked up with Battle Royale, and after reading it, I have something to say to all of you HG fans... You lose!

Sorry guys, but HG can't hold a candle to Battle Royale. BR does so much more with the fight-to-the-death premise than Hunger Games did. Don't get me wrong. I love the Hunger Games! But Battle Royale succeeds at such higher levels in every category. Let me explain in more detail...

Characters
Author Koushun Takami somehow manages to create 40+ vivid characters with their own hopes, beliefs, traits, physical qualities, and fears. It's also interesting to see how these things affect how the novel goes on. One person might turn into the ultimate killing machine while another may try to form a group to escape the island. From the fearful Megumi Eto to the psychopathic Mitsuko Souma, (who might be one of the saddest characters in literature) everyone is compelling in their own way. All 42 students, the program instructor, and some parents of the students, are mentioned and most have backstories. This is a change from the Hunger Games, where Suzanne Collins chooses to focus on about 10 characters, and Katniss narrates the whole story.

Plot
After reading Battle Royale, I probably looked like an old man who had just seen a panda bear ride a rocket ship into my neighbor&rsquo;s house.

That's right. There was action. There was betreyal. There was romance. There were tragic deaths. There were lucky breaks. There were unlucky life-ending mistakes. There was a bunch of other stuff that makes you wan to throw up and cry and jump up and down at the same time. That's the kind of effect Battle Royale had on me, and will have on you.

Complaints
I do some small problems with BR.
The translation wasn't as great as it could have been. It doesn't hinder the plot, but a ""him"" is called a ""her"" every once in a while and some helpful adjectives are left out.
I'd have appreciated a little more world building before we got into the action.
I feel like there wasn't enough about Yukie's group and about Mizuho Inada. These characters weren't killed off in the beginning of the novel but weren't talked about much there either.

Other
If you're looking for gore, Battle Royale is your kind of book. There's lots of blood, people lose their insides, and necks get snapped. No, it's not for those with light stomachs, but the rest of us will be satisfied with the action. One of the strong points about BR is that it's not all action and death. There's also a psychological element to it. Part of the novel is describing how some characters descend into madness, while others keep their cool. 

So Hunger Games fans, in case I haven't been clear enough, You must read this"
Battle Royale,156931778X,"Koushun Takami, Yuji Oniki",Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"This book is an amazing story, and is just like the hunger games with more intense fighting scenes, gore, a deeper plot, and no corny teenage ""but im betraying him if i like this guy, but i really like this guy, but the other guy is..."" 
Its Awesome"
Battle Royale,156931778X,"Koushun Takami, Yuji Oniki",Barnes and Noble,4.6,scubasubie,"This book, although graphic, should be on everyone's TO-READ list.

The Girl Who Chased the Moon,0553807218,Sarah Addison Allen,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Cerae,"I decided to read this book on a whim after seeing it on B&N.com. Having never read a Sarah Addison Allen book, I was a bit skeptical but I must say I was thoroughly impressed. It was a greatly gripping book from start to finish, and I read it in less than a day. I found it very hard to pull away from the book because you are so set on finding out what comes next. Magical fiction isn't really something I read at all, but after this book, I may have to continue reading more; especially by this wonderful author!"
The Girl Who Chased the Moon,0553807218,Sarah Addison Allen,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Frisbeesage,"Sarah Addison Allen returns to the South with The Girl Who Chased the Moon a magical novel about a young girl discovering her roots. Emily Benedict comes to Mullaby, North Carolina hoping to learn more about her reserved, strict mother. Instead she finds a town full of secret, unexplainable things. Lights flit around her yard at night, wallpaper in her room changes to suit her room, and her giant of a grandfather won't reveal anything. Emily doesn't believe in magic but she can't shake the feeling that something mysterious is going on.

Allen has, once again, written a fast-paced, entertaining book centered around good food and a touch of magical realism. Her characters are strong and interesting and their magical quirks are creative. She cuts the lighthearted story with just a pinch of darkness, keeping it from becoming too sweet. If you liked Sugar Queen and Garden Spells you will enjoy The Girl Who Chased the Moon as well."
The Girl Who Chased the Moon,0553807218,Sarah Addison Allen,Barnes and Noble,4.2,sweetpeaSP,"This is a lovely tale of mystery, romance and is sprinkled with magic. It's beautifully written and the town and its quirky inhabitants are real and alive, and charmingly portrayed. 

We are taken into the town of Mullaby, North Carolina after Emily has lost her mother, Dulcie, where she is transported to be with her extremely tall, reclusive grandfather, whom she didn't know existed. She learns of her mother's childhood, which seems so different from the woman she knew all her life. Emily discovers that her mother was involved in a scandal and that a young man had committed suicide over it. No one will tell her what it was. 
She quickly makes friends with Julia, a woman with a troubled past and who bakes cakes that seem magical. Emily becomes involved with a local boy who is linked to the mystery from the past, one that centers around her mother and an event that turned the little town on its heels. 

 There are many poignant moments, magic wallpaper, magic baking, and mysterious lights in the woods that all come together to provide the reader with hours of enjoyment.

Crocodile on the Sandbank (Amelia Peabody #1),0445406518,Elizabeth Peters,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"This is my third time reading this book that is how much I love it.  I haven't read the whole Amelia Peabody series yet but that's why I'm reading this book again, so I can read it in cronological order.  Like Publishers Weekly's review says 'If Indiana Jones were female,a wife and a mother who lived in Victorian times, he would be Amelia Peabody Emerson!'"
Crocodile on the Sandbank (Amelia Peabody #1),0445406518,Elizabeth Peters,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"I have enjoyed the Amelia Peabody series for years (my sister has lent me her collection), although I have never owned a copy till today.  That has been gladly remedied.  To my sister's joy, I am on a mission to purchase the entire series for my own enjoyment.  I urge everyone to read this series because one you've read the first book you will be hooked."
Crocodile on the Sandbank (Amelia Peabody #1),0445406518,Elizabeth Peters,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"In today's world of angsty vampires, lovesick werewolves, and teen wizards, it's refreshing to discover the Ameilia Peabody series.  These books feature a good old fashioned adventure - dastardly deeds, villains, and a plucky heroine.  Some readers will find them to be a bit slow compared to today's teen lit, but keep reading - they offer plenty of excitement and even some romance.  They are well-written with just enough of a challenging vocabulary to actually teach you a few new words as you go.  Overall, a good choice for teens and adults looking for something different."
"Bed of Roses (Bride Quartet, #2)",0425230074,Nora Roberts,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Allison_Davis,"This is Nora Roberts second book in the Bride Quartet. In the first book, Vision in White, we meet the pragmatic photographer, Mac, who must overcome her own practicalities to allow herself to fall in love. Now we meet Emma, the florist, who is a romantic to the core. She wants the whole nine yards- and indeed, she'd be the one to have a train just that long. She longs to be swept off her feet by true love.
I felt the romance in this book was much sweeter and maybe more 'romantic'- in part because Mac was the more practical sort and had to overcome herself to fall in love. Emma is a bit of a social butterfly, dating around, and an old friend works his way into her affections. This is my fiction favorite right now, as de-stressing is the order of the day. My nonfiction favorite right now is another great book that's worth reading called ""Emotional Intelligence 2.0"""

"Bed of Roses (Bride Quartet, #2)",0425230074,Nora Roberts,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Yellowsam,"To me this was the weakest of the series.  I feel that  Emma thinks she was &quot;entitled&quot; to invade Jack's home.  She should have realized that most men, and I don't care how long you know them, really values their privacy.  She wouldn't have had a key to my home either.  She knew the type of man Jack was while they were growing up, why did she expect for him to change all of the sudden b/c they were &quot;dating&quot;.  I also feel that the marriage proposal was rushed and not well thought out.  I feel he only did it to keep her friendship."
"Debt of Honor (Jack Ryan Universe, #8)",0425147584,Tom Clancy,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"I found the story ""Debt of Honor"" excellent. It would have been much better if I were not constantly distracted with typographical errors. Every few pages had an error. Words hyphenated in the middle of the line. Last names split into two words. The most common error is using the number one ""1"" in place of the word ""I."" It appears Barnes and Nobles just scanned a hardcopy book and said, ""Okay Nook Readers, here's your book."" It seems the text was never proofread. Barnes and Noble makes a considerable profit on selling ebooks over paperbacks when one considers the cost of printing, shipping, etc. The ebook version of ""Debt of Honor"" sells for ten cents less than the paperback version. I'm almost sorry I bought a Nook. I paid $139 for the Nook to save ten cents on a book and worse of all, the ebook version is full of mistakes. Shame on you Barnes and Nobile, I would have expected better from you."

This is the book that I would recommend to a stranger or my best friend."

Till We Have Faces,0156904365,C.S. Lewis,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Katherine Lehtola,Don't waste your money - purchase a print copy or meticulously edited ereader version. This is a very poor quality Nook version. The sheer number of mistakes/typos make this a slog-through copy.
Till We Have Faces,0156904365,C.S. Lewis,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"'Till We Have Faces' is a book I have read 5 times and have gleaned something new from it it every time. I am 17, and I first read it at 13. Every time I read it, I am humbled, because it is a mirror to show me my own selfishness and my self-love. This book demonstrates how we must die to ourselves before we can truly live--'If I'm really gonna live I gotta die to myself someday' (U2--Surrender). And the line at the end breaks me every time: 'I know now, Lord, why you utter no answer--before your face all questions die away. What other answer would suffice? Only words, words...' An amazing, and beautifully written work. Extremely poetic and elegant, yet humble and edifying in every way. A tapestry of everything beautiful. Highly recommended!!!"
Till We Have Faces,0156904365,C.S. Lewis,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"Once more, C.S. Lewis surprises his readers with his choice of vibrant characters and compelling themes. A spin-off of the Greek myth, the focus centers on the authentic motives and intentions of its main players. The reader will go so far as to question the gods themselves.     This story will leave a powerful impression, requiring readers to look deeply within themselves. How often do we confuse love with dependency, or the ability to care with the tendency to control? Lewis 'seperates the seeds' of the human heart, and invites others to do likewise. 'Till we Have Faces' is an absolutely beautiful adaptation of a story long forgotten (except on Valentine's Day--Cupid's included!)"

Again, he presents a simple problem familiar to most children.  While accompanying her daddy to the Laundromat, toddler Trixie loses her favorite stuffed animal, ¿Knuffle Bunny.¿ She realizes her loss on the way home and frantically tries to tell her father the problem.  Unfortunately, Trixie hasn¿t learned how to talk yet.  The more she tries to communicate with her father, the more upset she becomes, as does her baffled and frustrated father.  In an effort to help, observant readers are likely to shout out the obvious answer.  The images of the two at this stage and when Trixie¿s mother immediately guesses the problem upon their arrival at home are hilarious, cartooning masterpieces. The same is true for the family¿s mad dash to fetch Knuffle Bunny and her father¿s lengthy hunt for it. When he finally finds it, Trixie says her first words: ¿Knuffle Bunny!!!¿ Williems¿ amazingly simple, but expressive cartoon characters set against sepia-toned photographic images of an urban neighborhood illuminate his appropriately sparse text..

The story is sweet and really hits home.  It is amazing how beloved stuff animals really do become a part of the whole family.  As parents we truly will do anything to find these missing treasures.   The emotions found in this story capture the panic a parent feels when they can't find their little one's special snuggle toy and shows the essence of communication between toddler and parent.  It is a perfect book to sit down and snuggle together while you read.  If you like this story, I also recommend The Adventures of Paige and Berry Bear."

Entirely new and uninhabited Earths are only a step away, and pioneers are quickly claiming the nearest worlds East and West of our own planet. 
Joshua Valient¿, a natural stepper (a person who can step between Earths without using a Stepper Box) and a bit of a legend, is hired to go on a mission to the High Meggers--the earths more than a million steps away from our own. No pioneers have ever made it out that far and it is a challenge he looks forward to, until he discovers something that can consume all of the Long Earth and leave nothing but desolate silence in its wake.
Meanwhile, our own Datum Earth is having its own troubles. Opposite the natural steppers are people who cannot step at all, and they are speaking violently out about the steppers and the Long Earth. Political difficulty mires the Datum while an unknown threat moves slowly down the line of Earths towards humanity.
It's lucky Joshua has friends."

The style isn't obviously &quot;Terry&quot; but it flowed and was a quick read.  I couldn't put it down and hope that there will be some follow-up books to explore the Long Earth further.  I think folks need to see this as a collaborative work - it's not another Discworld novel, which is great.  A fresh idea is always a welcome addition.  

I was at the Convention in Madison and it was surprising to see this already published - what a lucky day when I stumbled upon it!"

The voice lies to me, wants to keep me fearful, unhappy and unproductive.  He then introduces the concept of &quot;Turning Pro&quot;.  The Pro still hears all that  racket but does his work or follows &ldquo;the pursuit of any calling&rdquo; regardless of what the internal noise says.  The Pro knows the voice will always be there.  The Pro keeps working no matter how loud resistance tries to speak.




Another book I love addresses resistance in a brilliant way.  How to Have a Match Made in Heaven: A Transformational Approach to Dating, Relating, and Marriage is a fabulous and inspiring book by Ariel and Shya Kane.  The authors offer an amazing possibility regarding resistance: notice the resistance, without judging it, and the resistance falls away.  The mere act of noticing and allowing whatever is happening to simply be the way it is, allows the very thing to dissolve.  I&rsquo;ve tried it and it works.  This innovative book has a unique and exciting feature: each story has an online web address that links you to a video of the very people you were just reading about.  I love that I can &ldquo;watch&rdquo; part of this book as well as read it's wisdom.  I am touched and energized by both of these smart and enlightening reads."
The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks & Win Your Inner Creative Battles,0446691437,"Steven Pressfield, Robert McKee",Barnes and Noble,4.3,StellaByStarlight,"Resistance...oh, boy. A killer...of manifesting so many plans, dreams, hopes.  Immediately attracted to The War of Art when I came across it,  I was then so frustratingly resistant to overcoming my Resistance that I kept avoiding reading it. I kept it on my night table so I wouldn't forget it was there. Then I forced myself to read a little at a time. I began to recognize how Resistance does its work in so many aspects of my life, and the harder I tried to avoid reading further, the more I knew I had found a true ally in my battle to come to terms with the force of Resistance that stood in my way.   Steven Pressfield's style in laying out the battle plans for the War of Art is straightforward, clear, respectful, hopeful and truly effective.   I am sincerely grateful for his willingness to share his experience and insight with the rest of us poor slobs who struggle to express our art, whatever that art might be.  ""Just do it"" sounds so easy, but we all know how difficult it is to do just that.  This powerful little book illuminates the Enemy and teaches us strategies in how to set free our individual ability to meet Resistance on a daily basis and kick its ass.  I'm not only painting again, I've started writing the novel that's been living in my head for years.   The best part, though, is that I finally realize that it is not the end result that is important...it really is the day-to-day doing of the work that matters and is so satisfying.  If you don't read any other ""motivational"" book in your life, read this one."
The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks & Win Your Inner Creative Battles,0446691437,"Steven Pressfield, Robert McKee",Barnes and Noble,4.3,turnerguns,"Steven Pressfield's historical novels are well-researched, vividly imagined, and satisfyingly dramatic.  Having read THE WAR OF ART, I now understand why.  Pressfield has learned how to defeat (or at least to battle to a stand-still) what he calls ""resistance,"" that self-defeating, self-destructive negative energy residing within all of us, the negative energy that defeats would-be writers, dieters, addicts, students, artists, entrepreneurs, heroes, and change-agents many times.  ""Resistance,"" says Pressfield, ""cannot be reasoned with.  It understands nothing but power.  It is an engine of destruction, programmed from the factory with one object only: to prevent us from doing our work.  Resistance is implacable, intractable, indefatigable.  Reduce it to a single cell and that cell will continue to attack.""  Worse, ""The more important a call or action is to our soul's evolution, the more Resistance we will feel toward pursuing it.""

This is more than mere writer's block; it is the fear we experience when we strive to reach a high plane of being.  If you go low, decide to end your work as an artist and go into a career in advertising, Pressfield says you have nothing to worry about, resistance will not hinder you.

Pressfield's book reminds me a bit of Emerson's ""Self-Reliance.""  Emerson said that our desire to conform and be one of the gang combined with our desire for consistency of self to prevent us from realizing our potential.  Pressfield recognizes the power of  social pressure: losers want to hang with other losers, so they sabotage anyone who tries to rise above.

He also gives us advice--avoid trouble, whether it arrives in the guise of consumerism or intoxicants:  ""The working artist will not tolerate trouble in her life because she knows trouble prevents her from doing her work.  The working artist banishes from her world all sources of trouble.  She harnesses the urge for trouble and transforms it in her work.""  So, don't smoke dope, don't get drunk, don't allow the world to be too much with you, getting and spending, lest you lay waste your powers.

But even when you understand the power of resistance, it does not die easily.  The way to kill it is with work, hard work, sometimes unrewarded hard work, the work done for its own sake, the work the artist must do to achieve his vision.  That sounds about right."
What We Talk About When We Talk About Love,0679723056,Raymond Carver,Barnes and Noble,3.7,misirlou on LibraryThing,"Raymond Carver's America is bleak. While Sherwood Anderson celebrates the inherent flaws in the individual, Carver works to accept the fact that some personality flaws can never be fixed. In this collection of his short stories, he relies on implication. Much in the way Hemingway likened his stories to icebergs (both are mostly hidden beneath the surface, leaving the viewer to piece together the real size of things based off of what they can see), Carver relies on an economy of language which makes his characters sadder and more pathetic as he asks the reader to imagine these people for themselves. This works because he presents believable characters. Even in a story like ""Tell the Women We're Going"" where the action (a seemingly unprompted double homicide) is unbelievable, the stories work because the characters are difficult not to believe. In the writing world, where characters are either too perfect or too intentionally eclectic, Carver creates characters whose flaws are mundane. The flaws are only shared with the reader because there's nothing the characters can do to change themselves-- their resignation is what gets you. Without Carver's keen eye for language, these stories wouldn't be nearly as interesting. In ""I could see the smallest things"" Carver pays special attention to having the narrator of the story see nothing clearly. Every statement she makes after she leaves the comfort of her house concerns her inability to see what's going on. As a metaphor, none of the characters in these stories can see what's going on. Either they choose to ignore the world, they're too caught up on themselves, or they see their mistakes but they take no actions to correct them.Despite the melancholy tone of the book, each story is capable of grabbing your attention and keeping hold of it until the last sentence. This isn't the best book to pick up if you're looking for something to cheer you up, but if you're looking for some easy-to-read, incredible short stories this is the book for you."

I'm a lover of short stories, but didn't get the praise/hype/awards that this guy has won.  The fiction is very sparse, and definitely has a very personal flair - mostly through subject matter, and the non-linear progression of the conversations.  I think this qualifies as voice, but the stories weren't that compelling to me.I'll re-read this in a year or so, to see if I missed something."
What We Talk About When We Talk About Love,0679723056,Raymond Carver,Barnes and Noble,3.7,stipe168 on LibraryThing,"Known for his anguished perusal of every word in his stories, Raymond Carver delivers an incredible collection here. There is an economy to these contemporary stories about cheating spouses and lost love affairs. Many short story writers try to include a whole world in as few words as they can - Carver just gives you a picture and lets you muse over it yourself."
That Summer,0670061107,Sarah Dessen,Barnes and Noble,3.7,readtolive_livetoread,"This is the first novel Sarah Dessen ever published. It's very short but its a good read. It shows Sarah's style of writing pretty easily. She really dipitcs how a teenage girl thinks and the problems and struggles that goes on in our minds. Like all of her books this one has debth which is very unlike most chick teen novels. There is always a lessen learned at the end of the book.
The bad thing about this book is that it's very quick. I could give a quick overview in about 5 minutes and you would know the whole book. Nevertheless it's a good day read.
In lyrical and unforgettably graceful prose, Sarah Dessen's first novel is at first glance a dull and unsatisfying story, but the closer you read into it, you begin to see the connections and truths and metaphors hidden within every sentence. The characters are deep and dimensional, and though the plot is rather cliche at first, Sarah Dessen takes us to new heights. A story built solidly, spectacularly, and beautifully."
That Summer,0670061107,Sarah Dessen,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,"This book was okay. It was sort of disapointing after reading someone like you and this lullaby. But it wasnt bad, just not as good at the other books by Sarah Dessen."
That Summer,0670061107,Sarah Dessen,Barnes and Noble,3.7,wondering_Imagining,"I understand that this is Sarah Dessen's first book, but this book totally dissapointed me. The whole book is just about her sisters wedding and thats all, there was no relationships at all really, and her sister was really a total jerk and I didnt like the sister as a character at all. Haven is an okay character but she's pretty boring. I made myself read this book since i got it from the media center at my school. I was overall dissapointed with this book since it didnt have an interesting storyline at all. Her other books are truly exceptional and she is my favorite author, but this book was a TOTAL miss for me."
"Theft of Swords (The Riyria Revelations, #1-2)",0316187747,Michael J. Sullivan,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"Hey Anoymouus...not sure why you gave the book a one star review without reading it but...as to your questions.


Can someone tell me what order these books go in? 
Theft of Swords (books 1 & 2)
Rise of Empire (books 3 & 4)
Heir of Novron (books 5 & 6)

This is in the description as well.


 Also, is there any bad stuff like cursing, impurity or immorality? Thank you in advance!

The book is free of foul language. It is about people who steal for a living so I guess you could say they are immoral.  But I wouldn't classify them as such. It is remarkably ""clean"" (no swearing, sexual scenes or graphic violence) and although written for adults can be enjoyed by people of a younger age."
"Theft of Swords (The Riyria Revelations, #1-2)",0316187747,Michael J. Sullivan,Barnes and Noble,4.5,JeanBookNerd,"At first glance, Theft of Swords (The Riyria Revelations Series) seem like your familiar fantasy series attached with everything that you have come to expect from that genre. The one thing that makes this stand out from the rest is how the author, Michael J. Sullivan, takes those familiarities and twists them into a refreshing approach, yet keeping that fantasy feel. The characters within the pages were radiantly crafted with care and the chemistry between them was strong and vivid.

The story is about two thieves, Royce and Hadrian, and their planned heist to take an important item within the walls of the king&rsquo;s castle. Just as they laid their hands on their prize, a trap is triggered when the lifeless body of the king is at their feet and they are accused for his demise. The story goes on a wild ride with the reader in the front seat the whole way.

Between the first page and the last, the reader will be entertained and taken into a journey of mystery, adventure, and murder. At the end, it seems like everything is back to normal and everyone is at
ease. Since this is the first book in the series, it is inevitable that our duo thieves will find themselves again in another predicament. Sullivan has done an outstanding effort in making a popular genre very likable for all. If you like fantasy and tired of the same thing you have come to expect, this book will offer new approaches to the genre. Just remember that Theft of Swords is book one of a trilogy and contains two &ldquo;stand-alone&rdquo; stories with endings."
"Theft of Swords (The Riyria Revelations, #1-2)",0316187747,Michael J.

Great job Mr. Sullivan!!"
"Necessary Lies (Necessary Lies, #1)",1250010691,Diane Chamberlain,Barnes and Noble,4.6,quaintinns,"I received an advance reading copy of Necessary Lies and could not wait to dive in!  I stayed up all night and finished it this morning!  An extraordinary and inspirational novel-cannot stop thinking about it----Diane did an outstanding job with a complex topic and her excellent research skills were definitely reflective throughout the book with careful plot planning and storytelling. 

Her best work thus far! From the character development (loved Jane/Ivy), the dialect, insight, the setting &ndash; she nailed it!  A beautiful story of loss, love, struggles, difficult choices, and redemption (loved the ending). I could very much relate being from the rural south (NC) in the sixties.  

Diane offers an insight as to the difficult choices and a close-up of how minors with little or no control over certain circumstances--with the feeling of no way out of their environment in order to change the vicious cycle---- Combine this with others having the power to make choices for them without thinking of their future or their best interests.  (It was amazing how much control social workers had over situations during this era.)   

Hats off to the tenacious professionals who &ldquo;cross the lines&rdquo; and take a chance for the welfare of their clients and their futures.  Set in rural Grace County, North Carolina in a time of state-mandated sterilizations and racial tension, Necessary Lies tells the story of these two young women, seemingly worlds apart, but both haunted by tragedy. A Must Read!  I look forward to the e-book The First Lie as well."
"Necessary Lies (Necessary Lies, #1)",1250010691,Diane Chamberlain,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,The strength of the human spirit definitely rules this storyline. This is another good one to have young ones read not only for the history of it but for the realization of what is important in life and what isn't. This is a beautifully written and memorable book to recommend and maybe even reread.
"Necessary Lies (Necessary Lies, #1)",1250010691,Diane Chamberlain,Barnes and Noble,4.6,DiiMI,"Set in rural Grace County, North Carolina in a time of state-mandated sterilizations and racial tension, Jane, a newly married social worker, who &ldquo;wants to make a difference,&rdquo; and Ivy, part of a poverty-stricken family whose remaining members each carry the result of tainted secrets in the family closet, are thrown together by circumstance and must ask themselves: how can you know what you believe is right, when everyone is telling you it&rsquo;s wrong? Necessary Lies by Diane Chamberlain is a gut-wrenching tale of poverty, bureaucracy and the will to survive against the odds while doing the right thing at any cost.

From page one, I was thrown into an unbelievable page out of history, wondering how ANYONE or any government could impose such mandates on another. Told from alternating points of view, I felt and saw both sides of life, from the day to day struggles to the mental turmoil and desperation felt by Ivy and Jane living in an era and place so different from anything I have ever known.

Diane Chamberlain writes with a flair for keeping this real and raw, yet not so over-powering that the reader feels they are reading horror fiction. Her style is eye-opening and will keep you turning each page, hoping for a happy ending for the well-drawn characters. Expect this one to stay with you for a long time.

I strongly suggest you read The First Lie, a short story prequel to Necessary Lies. You&rsquo;ll be glad you did. I was provided an ARC edition from NetGalley and St. Martin&rsquo;s Press in exchange for my honest review."

Montana Sky,0425205754,Nora Roberts,Barnes and Noble,4.5,kuhlcat,"This book bothered me for many reasons. The first of which, but not the most important, being that Lily, who was in an abusive marriage and recently got out of it and filed a restraining order against her ex, meets and marries someone within 9 months. I would think that an abusive relationship would make her more traumatized and more apt to be cautious when entering a new relationship.

Another irritant were her other two sisters, Willa and Tess. They, of course, fell in love with the other two hot guys in the novel, but they also learned something from them. And in return, the guys learned...oh, wait, they didn't learn anything. Aren't relationships about give and take? Learning from each other to become better people? The men, apparently, were perfect, while the women had much to learn. (It's hard to convey sarcasm in a blog...)

I'm also not a fan of points of view changing from paragraph to paragraph. I don't mind if it changes after a scene or after a chapter, but not within paragraphs. It gets too confusing when you're trying to figure out what the characters are thinking or feeling. Too much bouncing around.

This book paralleled the other book about three sisters living on (or near) a ranch that I read earlier, ""True Colors"". I was hoping that this one would rate a little above that one, but I'm not so sure. The characters were a bit deeper, and the mystery of the murderer helped to hold my interest, but overall the little details about the women and about relationships bugged me. I'm hoping I haven't lost my taste for romances, because some can be quite entertaining!"
Montana Sky,0425205754,Nora Roberts,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Carmen Cruz,"Nora Roberts is so clever with words and descriptions.  Loved the details, action and multiple romantic stories against a wonderful Montana setting.  The TV movie unfortunately did not do justice to this book!"
Montana Sky,0425205754,Nora Roberts,Barnes and Noble,4.5,tko122885,I have always thought that the book is almost always better than the movie. In this case I was right. I like the movie but the book was so much better! Things that happened in the book were not even in the movie or it was changed in the movie. I really liked this book. I liked the characters had so much more depth to them. I will read this book again.
Of Human Bondage,0451530179,"W. Somerset Maugham, Benjamin DeMott, Maeve Binchy",Barnes and Noble,4.1,patrickgarson on LibraryThing,"Of Human Bondage is a terrific book that ably demonstrates how far the standard of popular ""literary"" fiction has fallen in the years since its publication. Whilst by no means an intellectual heavyweight, Maugham's magnum opus is filled with effortless characterisation and a compelling eye for detail.Phillip Carey, orphaned and saddled with a club-foot that will irrevocably shape his personality, begins life with diffident discomfort, but he is nonetheless convinced of his greatness. Over the years, Phillip travels, falls in and out of love, and searches for happiness. Maugham's plot is a leisurely affair, especially in its first half - this is in no way helped by the synopsis for this edition which succeeds in summarising 350 pages of the novel, and then implying that the book is a grand romance (it is most assuredly not). For the same reasons, the foreword should definitely be avoided until the book is finished.Despite this, the novel picks up pace from about halfway through until the ending seems to come upon you quite suddenly. We're so accustomed to the current of Phillip's life that it's actually sad to leave him, especially on the cusp of another great chapter.This illustrates Maugham's gift for characterisation. Every single person in this book is fleshed out with a real - and compassionate - eye. It's a rare treat these days to find a writer with such a gift for characterisation and Maugham sidesteps the cliches that most writers use as tools of convenience for minor characters. Though the people in Of Human Bondage will infuriate or disappoint at times, there is never a point where their actions seem inscrutable. The prose is certainly solid and a cut above most contemporary writers, but Maugham - withstanding his dialogue - is not a great stylist. His prose is largely functional rather than breath-taking. Likewise, Of Human Bondage is not an intellectual odyssey; the pages don't leave you pondering in the way that Thomas Mann does in The Magic Mountain - an ostensibly similar book that is in actuality very different. Maugham certainly attempts to, and Phillip's agonised reflections may be revelations to some, but for me the real gold comes back to those characters, and the compassionate, sophisticated eye that Maugham casts on them.Ultimately - and appropriately - this novel is a supremely human experience. Maugham has a real gift for empathy and insight into people and it's on display on every page, as is his ultimate affection for them. Like real people, this means the book sometimes wanders or seems abstruse at times. It can be self-obsessed, or pompous, or foolish or naive. But it can also be creative, compassionate, heroic, loving, tragic, hilarious and irresistible. A genuine classic, and quite different from our current critical vogue."

Moist von Lipwig returns with a new challenge. He has been getting bored running the post office as things are running very smoothly. He has even taking to breaking in when darkness falls! Vertinari gives Moist the chance to work running the bank. He has to defer to a dog though when the former owner dies and the dog has the majority shares. The problem is the members of the great banking family the Lavishes all want to be in charge and Moist is definitely in their way.Meanwhile Adore Belle Dearheart is off looking for the fabled golden golems and things take a very interesting turn when the results of her diggings arrive in Ankh Morpork. The usual side characters make small cameo¿s like Angua, Carrot, CMOT Dibbler and DEATH. It is mostly led by new characters though apart from the wonderful Vetinari who I still think deserves his own novel.This was lots of fun and sees Pratchett on fine form. I like Moist and Adora as characters and it was good to see someone else besides me want to emulate Vetinari! I loved how Cosmo¿s story wrapped up and it will be fun to see which characters are in the next Discworld book. Plus the new Tiffany Aching novel is out soon. I wonder if this will be the next one to be made into a television adaptation."
"Making Money (Discworld, #36; Moist Von Lipwig, #2)",0061161640,Terry Pratchett,Barnes and Noble,4.3,TheoClarke on LibraryThing,Another well-structured novel from Pratchett that relies more on humourous phrasing than it does no jokes. Here the main plot about the establishment of a fiduciary banking system in Ankh-Morpork is wrapped with several subplots that explore the nature of identity and perception.
"Making Money (Discworld, #36; Moist Von Lipwig, #2)",0061161640,Terry Pratchett,Barnes and Noble,4.3,fieldri1 on LibraryThing,"Now here is something that is unusual. I read this book in April 2009, a little over six months since the banking system almost went in to meltdown, and, weirdly for a Terry Pratchett book, this actually felt almost topical!  Not that the world of Discworld's banks need bailing out to the tune of billions of dollars, but being about banking, and trying to make it something that could benefit everyone, not just the already obscenely rich.The story is a sequel to 'Going Postal', an earlier entry in the Discworld canon. This time the central character 'Moist Von Lipwig' has been asked to take over the running of the Royal Bank of Ankh-Morpork.  The reason is that Vetinari, the tyrannical ruler is intent on expanding the city and he needs a banking system that makes that possible.I'm strongly of the opinion that Terry Pratchett's writing has almost continuously improved as the Discworld series has gone on. His ideas, plotting and execution have improved during the time he has been regailing us with his tales. 'Making Money' does nothing to buck that trend in my mind. It is an enjoyable romp full of deft, humourous touches.  If you're a fan then I think you'll love it. If you're not and you sneer at fantasy, then this won't be enough to convert you."
Harvesting the Heart,0140230270,Jodi Picoult,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Anonymous,"Before I begin, I have to say that I'm very biased when it comes to Ms. Picoult. I first saw her at a book signing for Nineteen Minutes and instantly liked her. Since that book signing, I've read nine of her books, with the intention of reading her entire collection. Having said that, I have to say the first part of Harvesting the Heart was extremely difficult for me to get into. I never thought of putting it down or reading another book. At times I had to force myself to read and looking back, I'm glad that I did.I don't want to say too much about the storyline and when things began to pick up for me, (may be a spoiler for some) but after a certain event happened, I couldn't stop reading. After I finished reading the book, I thought about my feelings regarding the first chapters. When Paige and Nicholas first meet, they are from different worlds. He has had everything handed to him and she has given up a dream that she feels she doesn't deserve. Despite their differences, they fall in love and decide to marry. During the early years of their marriage, I consider Nicholas to be extremely selfish and Paige to be very passive. Even for them, it was hard for both of them to be with the other. So, I'm wondering, as the reader, was it hard for me to be with them as well.As I mentioned earlier, Paige comes to a crossroad in the marriage where she has to choose to move ahead or finally deal with the past she left behind. She makes a decision, that will set in motion events that will determine the fate of her marriage. Harvesting the Heart, for me, was typical Jodi Picoult. I finished the book with many questions and could not stop thinking about the characters. Actually, what was missing was a trial scene. Having read most of her recent books first, it was nice to go back and read one of her earlier works. Ms. Picoult has grown as a writer, however even then she knew how to tell a story."

"Never Fade (The Darkest Minds, #2)",1423157516,Alexandra Bracken,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"Don't have time to write a lengthy review right now, so I'll get straight to the point. This really is an awesome second installment; if you were a fan of the first book, you'll love this one too; as I did. 

I loved every new character, especially Cole, who I am very excited to see more of, in the next book. 
The pacing of the story was great; there were a couple of slight things -toward the beginning- that didn't feel organic, but they were slight, and really they were overshadowed by some edge-of-your-seat moments that began 3/4ths of the way in, and didn't let up until the very last sentence.

I follow this author on Twitter as well, and noticed she's been advertising strong opinions on pirating, like many authors have before. I'm not a fan of rants such as those, and I'm not in complete agreement or disagreement with her, but for what it's worth, if anyone is debating on whether they should BUY this book, I advise you do. It is a wonderful and well-written book, truly, and definitely worth the money."
"Never Fade (The Darkest Minds, #2)",1423157516,Alexandra Bracken,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Sailon,"Warning: Please make sure you have plenty of uninterrupted time before you pick up this pretty lengthy book. OK, I snapped at interrupters and read into the wee hours of the morning...yes Never Fade was that good.




Ruby is entrenched in the Children&rsquo;s League but from what I'm seeing not much of it is focused on children...just power. Their are enemies all around and treachery even within the league. 




While plotting and secrets abound, Ruby is called upon to break from a Children's League OP and find Liam Stewart (Yes, Liam that she left behind). Liam holds a vital key to exposing the government. It is contained in a flash drive sown into a jacket he accidentally took when on the run.




Ruby makes a desperate trek to find Liam. She finds unlikely allies and friends along the way.




I LOVED this story. Ruby is an extraordinary heroin. A true heroin with flaws, insecurities and an ability that could be monstrous but even when unleashed she still holds herself in check. 




Devastating loss, heart wrenching emotion, gruesome betrayals are seamlessly countered by undying friendship, selflessness and some kick a** action. This truly is a marvelously riveting story that is filled with amazing plot twists and turns! My heart is still pounding from the non-stop, tension infused story-line. I'm still reeling from the WOW factor and Alexandra Bracken has once again, left me wanting more. This is a young adult must read for 2013.

Dewey: The Small-Town Library Cat Who Touched the World,0446407410,"Vicki Myron, Bret Witter",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"This book is for everybody. Whether you are a child or an adult, whether you like cats or not, even whether you like reading or not! It is a really heartwarming story that reads very easy and that will fill your heart with great affection. It is a story of an extraordinary cat, a librarian, and their lives in a small Iowa town. It's a story that brought the little town of Spencer onto the world map. The Japanese television filmed Dewey, and after he died, his obituary ran in over 200 papers. But most of all, this isn't just another cat story; it's a story of survival, endurance, trust, and hope. Finally, it is a story about love and living a good life. You will understand all that after you read the final few chapters. I highly recommend this book! You will fall in love with Dewey after reading the first few pages. I promise you that! For more heartwarming stories about another ginger cat I suggest the series of ""Why Some Cats are Rascals"". Read them all - you will want to share the stories with your loved ones."
Dewey: The Small-Town Library Cat Who Touched the World,0446407410,"Vicki Myron, Bret Witter",Barnes and Noble,4.3,KatelynLucile,"This book is a treasure! As an animal lover, I really got a lot out of the touching story. Also, the information about what it's like in a small town library was very enlightening. You'll laugh, you'll probably cry, but you'll go away with a greater appreciation for our furry friends."
Dewey: The Small-Town Library Cat Who Touched the World,0446407410,"Vicki Myron, Bret Witter",Barnes and Noble,4.3,LuckyCat,"I read the book in a day, not being able to put it down.  Even though I knew what the outcome would be, I allowed myself to cherish the story, day by day; year by year.  I so appreciate the honest, realistic and, sometimes, commonplace depictions of Deweys life; representing the wonderful, warm moments he shared throughout his life in the Spencer library; as well as the descriptions of his physical ailments.  These are what happens to a kitty body; just as our own human bodies.  My only hope is that some of the financial gain earned from this book and a possible movie, as well as other outcroppings of Dewey's life, is used to create a no kill shelter for all the abandoned kittens and animals in need who are not as furtunate as Dewey was.  The three kittens since which were placed in the Spencer library drop box, as well as the hundreds purportedly offered to the Spencer library need homes, care and love just as Dewey did.  I hope Vicki Myron sees to this and expands Dewey's influence to others of his species who are in need."
"The School for Good and Evil (The School for Good and Evil, #1)",0062104896,Soman Chainani,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Amabe421,"This book was so fun!! I got completely lost in it and couldn't seem to get enough. The characters, the story, everything just came together so well! I was lost in the magic and the fairy tale world. I was excited to know what their story would be. What a cool premise!! This book was pure excitement for me. I haven't felt so lost in a world since reading Harry Potter. This was a fantastic start to what is sure to be a series people will fall in love with!

Sophie has wanted to be a princess her whole life. She has prepared for it. She is a firm believer of the rumor that each year two children are taken, one for good, and one for evil. When she gets taken and ends up in the school for evil she thinks there had to have been a mix up. Of course we soon learn that she is not really good and pure. She is in fact selfish, self centered, and not really very nice at all. The thing is, she really thinks that she is. She was a hard character to like personality wise, but I absolutely loved her. She made the story amazing!

Agatha who is boring, drab, and not pretty should have been in the school of evil right? Not a chance. She doesn't fit in with the gorgeous, well mannered princess girls, but her inner good is what makes her beautiful. It's clear from the very beginning that she is right where she belongs in the school for good. I loved that she was always so willing to help people, especially Sophie. Sophie was so mean and insulting to her, but she cares about her. She will always be there for her friend. I really loved Agatha! She was the root of the story for me.

There is of course romance. What kind of fairy tale would it be without one? I would like to say that I liked the love interest, but he was a bit of a shallow jerk at times. I did like him, but I thought that he could have been a little nicer. He has his issues though, so I can see where that stems from. I thought the way the romance was done was absolutely brilliant. I won't really go into it more than that, but it was really great!!

This book was amazing story wise, but what made it even more fabulous was listening to the audio. The narrator captured the characters and the story so well. I was enchanted by the story telling and could not have asked for a better narrator for this particular book. I loved this book, but the audio was the icing on the cake!

Full of action and adventure, this is a must read book. I enjoyed every single second of it. Filled with great characters, and a fantastic setting, this is sure to please! There is a bit of a cliffhanger ending, but it's not so much you want to tear your hair out. I can't wait to see where the story goes next. If you are looking for a great audio, this is one you will want to get, but the physical copy is full of beautiful illustrations also that really enhance the enjoyment. I would recommend this book to anyone!!

"The School for Good and Evil (The School for Good and Evil, #1)",0062104896,Soman Chainani,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"Sorry guys, but... Stop the role plays please! (Not just warrior ones). I want to see reviews! I loved this book, and i wanted to see what other people thought about it... Not rps. O_O Click yes if you agree with me."
"The School for Good and Evil (The School for Good and Evil, #1)",0062104896,Soman Chainani,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"This book was great. It's a super smart take on fairy tales. Instead of the same old, tired retelling with the same characters, this book creates a whole new world and a lot of great new characters. The story is pretty simple -- a princess and a witch in different schools, but the book twists and turns in a way that makes it impossible to predict what happens next. It has the magic and scares you expect from a book with a title like 'The School for Good and Evil', but there's also a lot of really funny humor to it. The book never really reads like a kid's book, which is great. I think it has high potential to be the book of the Summer."
"For a Few Demons More (The Hollows, #5)",0060788380,Kim Harrison,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Kasia_S,"Slipping back into Kim Harrison's world of Rachel and her friends and foes is very comforting. It makes me wish that I could never leave it because once I start reading her books I feel lost and amazed, the real world forgotten and far away in my mind. Each new volume beckons me to indulge in another fantastic adventure where the fights, jokes, puns, some wicked magic and charismatic characters hold me in a trance until the last page is devoured. The fifth book of the series has been the book of changes, so much happens from when we last saw Rachel, her solid ground composed of Jenks, Ivy, Kisten, Ceri, David, Glenn and few others is unraveling in all directions. She is torn between her wild romance with Kisten and the lurking desires she's growing for Ivy, not sure whether she wants to be friends or more, debating with herself while fighting werewolves, pissed of demons, alluring vampires, tricky elfs, hilarious pixes and not so nice witches and all sorts of enigmatic creatures with agendas of their own. With power struggles happening between those at the top of the food chain, Rachel is caught in the middle with everything she holds dear at stake. I can't say any more, these books can be easily spoiled; something that I knew was going to happen did in deed happen and it didn't lessen the shock but it took something away form me. So for those who aren't up to this book, start from the beginning and don't go peaking at spoilers. The ending was so intense that I was torn between being afraid of reading through it and not wanting to see how the whole demon tangled up mess would resolve and unable to wait for the sixth book to arrive in the mail so I can rip the box open and pounce on it. Each character has been so lovingly written and so incredible real that any pain they went through I felt as well. Reading their stories and following their dreams, victories and fights always made me feel close to them, as if they were part of my own family. I am embarrassed to say but by page 444 tears were bubbling in my eyes, and I was a sobbing mess, I can't remember the last time a book made me cry! I can honestly say that this is my favorite series of all the books I have ever read, I can't imagine anything being warmer and filled with more glow, magic and real heart than this gem of a series. Utter perfection in my opinion and the more the better. - Kasia S."
"For a Few Demons More (The Hollows, #5)",0060788380,Kim Harrison,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,People writing review need to PLEASE STOP WRITING SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!It would be nice to read reviews without being told who dies!! this is so rude!!!!
"For a Few Demons More (The Hollows, #5)",0060788380,Kim Harrison,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Strawberry_Vamp,"In For a Few Demons More by Kim Harrison, Rachel Morgan, Jenks, and Ivy Tamwood leap over hurdles and go where few have gone before. Kim Harrison's vivid language gives insight to her mind and that of her characters."
"The Secret Place (Dublin Murder Squad, #5)",0670026328,Tana French,Barnes and Noble,3.6,TheReadingWriter,"Until I&rsquo;d navigated the shoals of Irish teen speak in SKIPPY DIES by Paul Murray, I might have been dismissive of the enormous skill it takes to recreate the speech patterns of a dozen teens. By now I am inoculated against scorn for the abbreviations and <em>slangerizing</em>
 of words that compose ordinary conversation, and parse much more quickly now.

Tana French&rsquo;s sleight of hand places in parallel the confusing world of just-awakening teens alongside squads of police learning their craft in the harsh and unforgiving world of crime. By juxtaposing the two groups, we see the seeds of the men and women the teens will become.

St. Kilda&rsquo;s Girl School and St. Colm&rsquo;s Boy&rsquo;s School are just across the way from one another, and the boarders at each mix at dances or in the town shopping arcade called the &ldquo;Court.&rdquo; They try on their adult selves like clothes at the thrift shop&mdash;delighting and discarding with snide remarks and zings of pleasure.

French slowly unfurls her story, showing us how teens so close to the right answer in the test that is life can actually get the wrong result. It is agonizing to share in the desperation of lovely, lonely girls seeking a closeness together they all feel but cannot preserve. French creates marvelously complex and fully realized girls, boys, cops, but one stands out: Holly Mackey, daughter of Frank Mackey, the detective introduced in FAITHFUL PLACE. Holly is sixteen with a mind like a steel trap. One can&rsquo;t wait to see what she will become. 

Two detectives, Antoinette Conway of the Murder Squad and Stephen Moran of Cold Cases, work together for a day and a night on the year-old death of one of the Colm boys. Loners both, they approach the case from different directions. Antoinette takes a flashy MG to the tony school to &ldquo;Get the respect.&rdquo; Stephen would prefer to drive &ldquo;an old Polo, too many miles, too many layers of paint not quite hiding the dings. You come in playing low man on the totem, you get people off guard.&rdquo; Antoinette faces criticism and office taunts straight on, with hostility. Stephen instead sidesteps the sarcasm and, joshing back, lowers the tension while awaiting his moment to outshine the club boys.

Detective Frank Mackey, both admired as well as feared, makes an appearance during the investigation and suggests the younger cops &ldquo;go along [with their lesser colleagues] to get along.&rdquo; Both reject his advice and earn his grudging respect. This may be French&rsquo;s point after all: one must cleave to the notion there is something you care about more than the adulation of crowds. There may not be as much wisdom as needed in crowds after all.

French involves us completely with the subterfuges of the young folk in the book. We know how teens are: smart, secretive, seductive in what they choose to share. But we also know they are not as clever as they think they are, and they cannot outrun the ghost of youth.

I listened to the audio of this book alongside the paper copy. Stephen Hogan and Lara Hutchinson alternated reading and though the narrative shifted from  the year-old lead-up to the murder and the current investigation, points of view were capably interleaved. I was rapt for the duration of this stellar mystery."
"The Secret Place (Dublin Murder Squad, #5)",0670026328,Tana French,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Anonymous,"I have read all of the other books in the series and I couldn't get past the first 100 pages of this one.   Perhaps this novel is intended for the young adult genre, I wish I would have known that prior to purchasing it."
"The Secret Place (Dublin Murder Squad, #5)",0670026328,Tana French,Barnes and Noble,3.6,rtpana,Huge disappointment from a favorite author. Repetitive and trite. Couldn't make up it's mind whether it was a mystery or a thriller - plus some sill supernatural elements that went nowhere. What was she thinking?
"Mistborn Trilogy Boxed Set (Mistborn, #1-3)",076536543X,Brandon Sanderson,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Demitrious,I had been reading Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time and frankly was a little bored with book #10 Crossroads of Twilight when I saw that Brandon Sanderson had just finished book #12 The Gathering Storm for Mr. Jordan.  I read a few paragraphs at random and felt compelled to read more as I had Jordan's earlier books in the series.  I wanted to see how Brandon Sanderson's own work compared so bought the Mistborn trilogy.  Frankly it was a quick and exciting read right from the start.  I have recommended it to several relatives and friends - no one has been disappointed.
"Mistborn Trilogy Boxed Set (Mistborn, #1-3)",076536543X,Brandon Sanderson,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Tyler_MCA_Knight,"First of all, let me say that Brandon Sanderson has one of the best writing styles i have ever seen. I would nearly classify him with Raymond E. Feist, author of the Riftwar saga and the related series. All three of these books were able to capture my attention so thouroughly that sleeping was not an option. The imagery of the surroundings leaves something to be desired, but he makes up for it in plotline and character development. The first book was, in my own opinion, the best. Mr. Sanderson has created a marvellous piece of art; one that I would reccommend to any lover of science fiction and/or fantasy."
"Mistborn Trilogy Boxed Set (Mistborn, #1-3)",076536543X,Brandon Sanderson,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Too_Busy_Reading_To_Write,"Where have I been?  How come I haven't read Brandon Sanderson before?  Sanderson has wonderful, rich dynamic characters. I like the balance between the external and internal struggles they face.  His magic system is wonderful and unique!  Wonderful plot twists and turns. I read every single word written on the page--that's how good this book is.  I usually find myself skimming through sections of books that don't further the characterizations or the plot, but this book held me captive to each and every word and concept. This is a must read for the genre, and I would even reccomend it to someone interested in branching into Fantasy for the first time, though the Mistborn series might ruin all other fantasy for them as it is sooo good. How can Sanderson write such thick books that seem to whiz by?  His pacing is incredible and his writing is excellent--it will endure the test of time."
"The Emperor's Code (The 39 Clues, #8)",0545060486,Gordon Korman,Barnes and Noble,4.5,LauraFabiani,"And so the hunt for the 39 clues continues, culminating in another revelation at the end of this book with enough unanswered questions to leave the reader anxious to read the next book. For the first time, 11 year-old Dan Cahill gets separated from his 14 year-old sister Amy Cahill and their au pair Nellie Gomez in China, a country with a population of over one billion people. Dan inadvertently joins Jonah Wizard and we learn more about this character, the Janus branch, and his role in the search for the 39 clues.

I love the relationship between Dan and his sister. We get to see how it is tested once again at this point in the story and how much they care for one another. Two scenes in this book reveal their characters when faced with choices to beat their opponents.

The historical figures that lead us to the next clue are Puyi, China's last emperor, and George Mallory. I really enjoyed the setting of this book, and although the last nail-biting scene was a little far-fetched, it's what marks The 39 Clues as an adventurous roller-coaster ride filled with interesting historical and scientific tidbits. Unlike the other books, this one also contains a message within the book that is conveyed by putting together the 17 words circled throughout the book. They form three sentences.

Two more books left in this series and I am eager to find out how it will all come to a finish. For fans of The 39 Clues this book will not disappoint. It builds up expectation for what will come next . and for the climactic ending, no doubt."
"The Emperor's Code (The 39 Clues, #8)",0545060486,Gordon Korman,Barnes and Noble,4.5,SuperBookish,Got it as gift. It was great. loved it.
"The Emperor's Code (The 39 Clues, #8)",0545060486,Gordon Korman,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,This is an absolute thrilling book from beginning to end.  The book takes you on an adventure around the world with two children Dan and Amy and their chase to find the 39 clues.  The book is the 8th in a set of 10 that take you on a thrilling chase around the world.  These books are more for a 4th grade or older reading level.  I originally started buying them for my daughter thinking she would like to read them when she got older and so I decided to read them myself.  My husband also loves them and we can't wait till the next one comes out.  These books remind me of the movie national treasure with all the ways that the clues are all set in history.  Definatly a set that you will want to buy.
"The Drop (Harry Bosch, #17; Harry Bosch Universe, #21)",0316069418,Michael Connelly,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Kataman1,"This is another excellent book about Harry Bosch, my favorite LAPD homicide investigator.  The title of the book may throw the reader off though.
The DROP in this book refers to the Deferred Retirement Option Program of the LAPD.  Harry is still working in the Unsolved Cases unit and is at the mandatory retirement age and had put in for a DROP.  Through it is not the focal point of the story, it does tie in to Harry's mindset throughout the book.
Harry and his partner Chu get assigned to a cold case of a woman who was murdered several years prior.  The DNA evidence on the case points to Clayton, Pell a convicted sex-offender.  This would be a slam dunk except that when the crime happened, Pell was only eight years old.
Before Harry can investigate further he is told from the people upstairs (his former partner Kiz Rider) that he must drop everything and devote his entire effort to investigating the apparent suicide of a councilman's son.  This brings up an issue for Harry.  Firstly, he does not like the councilman at all and is anxious to investigate the other case.   He is told that the councilman's son is crucial because the councilman is responsible for department budget cuts and handling this case could help the LAPD get some of their funding back.
Of course Harry will do things his way and will find ways to bypass instructions and work on both cases at once.  At times through the book Harry's actions will alienate those around him, especially his partner Chu and his new love interest (a social worker helping Clayton Pell).  The book never gets boring and Harry's relentless and methodical pursuit to get to the truth is prevalent throughout.  Even his daughter Madeline seems to pitch in for some good advice and could play a bigger role in future books to come.
I give the book four stars and would have rated it higher except that I felt a little uncomfortable with Harry pursuing a relationship with the social worker for Clayton Pell."
"The Drop (Harry Bosch, #17; Harry Bosch Universe, #21)",0316069418,Michael Connelly,Barnes and Noble,3.9,booksonmynook,"Loved this book. Bought it yesterday, finished it today. Great Read!"

"Sailor Moon, #1 (Sailor Moon, #1)",189221301X,Naoko Takeuchi,Barnes and Noble,4.9,Guest,"I never knew sailor moon was a book till today. i watched the show when I was little but they stopped translating the show in english in 1993 when i was born, so i never got to finish watching all of the series, but i LOVED IT and i bought all the dolls when I was little. I'm 15 now and I thought the books were going to be childish but apparently im wrong so im gonna have to go read one. =]"
"Sailor Moon, #1 (Sailor Moon, #1)",189221301X,Naoko Takeuchi,Barnes and Noble,4.9,Guest,"I love Sailor Moon. It was the best series ever. I can't believe it was canceled. Even though i'm almost 16 i'm not afraid to admit that i loved this series. Also I even had a teeny-tiny crush on Darien(like the rest of you girls didn't.).  I think it should start being sold to the public again. It's gives kids good charachters to look up to. Plus for all of us older fans, to not sell it anymore, is like taking away our best childhood memories. Anyway if you could still by it I would most definitely recommend ya'll to buy it."
"Sailor Moon, #1 (Sailor Moon, #1)",189221301X,Naoko Takeuchi,Barnes and Noble,4.9,nmhale on LibraryThing,"This is where it all started. I first saw this anime on a random dubbed broadcast on television, and though I couldn't find the show anywhere else for a long time, I was hooked on anime from that moment. Then I decided to pick up the manga series just because I had such fond memories of the show, and that propelled me into collecting other manga series, too. History repeats itself. We must all know the plot of Sailor Moon by now, so I'm just going to summarize why I enjoy this series. The romance is what first drew me - boy and girl despise each other and then fall in love - but I liked all the transformations and magic spells and friendships, too. This was the first magical girl series that I had seen. The relationships between the senshi are sweet and funny. I like the blending of silly and slapstick behavior with serious moments, even of self sacrifice. The manga series has a much darker side, and the events in this book move quickly. After all, the first series is all held in four and a half volumes of manga. Usagi and Mamoru also realize the others' identity pretty quickly, and I like that they notice clues about each other right from the beginning. I appreciate the serious tone of the manga, which makes the series more mature than the anime."

Assassination Vacation,074326004X,Sarah Vowell,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"This is one of my favorite books. It is a great story of history and the happen-chance meetings and situations that are woven into it.  Many fascinating stories - especially enjoyable for those of us who enjoy trivia - written in a very lively, free-flowing style.  Very enjoyable read."
Assassination Vacation,074326004X,Sarah Vowell,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"I enjoyed this book. If you are interested in presidential assassinations but don't feel like nodding off in between lines of dry, academic drivel...this is the book for you. It presents the facts in a well organized way with a little humor thrown in; I should emphasize 'a little humor' because some of the jokes just are not funny.  However there is an O.C. reference which saved the day for me. I also took a walk around Chelsea and checked out some of the buildings and statues. It got me excited about leader-of-the-free-world death all over again."
Assassination Vacation,074326004X,Sarah Vowell,Barnes and Noble,4.1,historlila,"So I do tend to identify with Sarah's polotics, but even beyond that...I'm obsessed with her. She is an amazing and witty writer. Reading one of her books is like having a little chat with a friend. In fact, sometimes I imagine the conversation I would have if I were at dinner with Sarah, David Sedaris, and Ira Glass. They love me; it's excellent."
Nine Princes in Amber (The Chronicles of Amber #1),0380014300,Roger Zelazny,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"I have been waiting for YEARS for this series to be published on Nook. Zelazny was a brilliant writer; if you haven't read him yet, get ready for a master class on writing. This is a truly original work  of imagination. And it's the first in a series that will keep you looking for the next book. I'm also waiting for his 'Lord of Light,' 'The Doors of His Face . ..' Please, B&N, bring them out asap.

Nine Princes in Amber (The Chronicles of Amber #1),0380014300,Roger Zelazny,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"One of the great achievements  in sci-fi/fantasy. Still ahead of it's  time 45 years down the road.

The Museum of Extraordinary Things,1451693567,Alice Hoffman,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"Alice Hoffman is a beautifully gifted writer.   Her imagery creates  a world of magic and love for her readers. Her beautiful prose shows us  how fragile and vulnerable we all are and how strong our need for love is. Her mystical imagination sees magic in the world and enables us to do the same.  Her writing is endearing, soulful and true to our hearts.  Many of Hoffman's novels are historically placed and her lovely writing makes these places real and believable, and teaches us that some things remain the same: our need for love and understanding.     Use a bit of imagination, a love of poetic phrasing, belief in possibility,  and you will enjoy this story of flawed  and  misunderstood characters .   
misunderstood characters.  They are representative of of all of us."
The Museum of Extraordinary Things,1451693567,Alice Hoffman,Barnes and Noble,4,MoonshadowJM,"Disappointing and lacked the magic of other Alice Hoffman books.  This book had a lot of promise and the beginning drew me in. It is set in a very interesting time for New York City and crafted around historic events, which is what I liked about the book.  However, the ending fell flat and I found it predictable. I also didn't get the &quot;love at first site&quot; for Coralie and Edward, nor what they saw in each other.  This felt forced."
The Museum of Extraordinary Things,1451693567,Alice Hoffman,Barnes and Noble,4,pandabearCM,"I have read a lot of Alice Hoffman and like her better as a writer whose novels are set in the present time and in the local Boston area.(I am from Boston so I think I like the local setting). While I like history and fiction to combine the two is very hard; either the fiction or history is compromised. 

In addition, Alice Hoffman's liking stories that involve magic does not go well together with historic factiods.

The story of Coralie I found to be totally unrealistic. I did not think a girl that had been raised the way she had been as much of a chance of becoming a normal person without much help.

The romance of the story is love at first site. I did not see what Eddie and Coralie saw in each other.

The story of Eddie Cohen breaking away from Orthodox Jewish tradition is better. Also I liked the story about the poor factory workers living in the same city as the rich factory owners was effective.

However, I did not feel the two story lines of the circus and Eddie the photographer ands immigrant combined well. They belong in two separate novels. 

Received an ARC copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."

As Orson Scott Card exxplains in the epilogue, most of the book happens in between chapter 14 and 15 of Ender's Game.  If you have just finished Ender's Game, i suggest that you read this book before you move on to Speaker for the Dead. But, if you are like me and are already further into the series, it is not completely necessary to read this book."
"Ender in Exile (Ender's Saga, #1.2)",0765304961,Orson Scott Card,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Lindsey_Miller,"Card himself notes that although the main story that emerges from the narrative is this two-year journey across to the new colony, the true purpose behind writing the book was to fill in many of the gaps from the other books in the series. Honestly, I found it a little boring, and although Card's ability to intricately weave a web of strategy and psychological battle, there's not enough going on in the meta-narrative to keep my interest. With many of the other books in this series, there are great wars being fought on the outside as well as the battles between characters on the inside. This one is largely lacking the great wars being fought on the outside to keep the tension high. The psychological interplay is interesting, but not enough to keep me turning from page to page as fast as possible. Also, it's good that Card is filling in some of the gaps, and that will make this an interesting read for lovers of the Ender series and Ender universe, but on their own, the shorter stories aren't that engaging. -Lindsey Miller, lindseyslibrary"

MJD has managed to write a book that had me laughing-out-loud from page one, and kept me laughing all the way to the end. A new twist in vampire stories, I can't wait for the next installment, UNDEAD AND UNEMPLOYED.

"Undead and Unwed (Undead, #1)",042519485X,MaryJanice Davidson,Barnes and Noble,4.2,jwheelzJW,I read this book after reading reviews because I enjoyed the Sookie Stackhouse series and heard it was similar. This book was a pleasant surprise! Betsy was hilarious and Sinclair sounds just plain hot. It had plenty of humor and romance and even some action thrown in. I'm definitely excited to read the rest of Betsy's story.
The Power of Myth,0385418868,"Joseph Campbell, Bill Moyers",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"It is captivating and understandable; anyone can explore and understand the concepts and themes. The Power of Myth encompasses so many themes relating to mythology.  The book is brimming with in depth information, from reoccurring symbols like the serpent, the hero's journey that crops up in almost every story ever told, to the driving force of mythology and religion. This book is a complete guide to myths and their importance. 
I really enjoyed the way Dr. Campbell intertwined the myths and religious stories from across the world and applied them to the way we live life. The reader also glimpses more details different religions, as Dr. Campbell occasionally tells stories from many different cultures and religions through the world and highlights similarities of these religions. To me this made the themes a lot richer and significant. Dr. Campbell also made them relevant; Star Wars even made its way into the conversation as an example of how the themes in myths aren't mythical. 
This book is definitely interesting, but it's not a page turner. I found that I couldn't sit and read it for any long periods of time. This book is not for you if you lack patience or if you looking for a fast and effortless read. However, it is a worthwhile read and if you interested in the way myths are shaped and how they shape our life, or even just religion, definitely read this book, check out the DVD series, or one of Dr. Campbell's other works such as The Hero with a Thousand Faces. The Power of Myth was an incredibly meaningful and enlightening book and I strongly recommend it."
The Power of Myth,0385418868,"Joseph Campbell, Bill Moyers",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"Ever wondered why a serpent is a common theme in mythological literature, as well as religious tales?  Or perhaps the real question is why characters in fiction seem to go through the same steps before the end of the story?  In Joseph Campbell's The Power of Myth, all questions about symbolism in mythology are addressed and answered, including how mythology aids daily life today.
	Many different aspects of myth are explored throughout the pages.  Campbell goes into detail with where mythology is placed in today's society, the stories of different beliefs, the history of the hero's journey with fictional literature, as well as how people use myths in their everyday lives.  Not a single topic under the general category of the influences myth has is missed.
	This book was well-liked for various reasons.  The interview format doesn't skip a single word, so the information presented is very detailed and in-depth. This work is helpful if the reader would like to learn more about the symbolism behind stories involved with religions and literature, and it helps the reader to understand and appreciate the meaning and importance of those myths.  The relationships between mythology and life today are recognized, as well as how important those connections are.  Campbell also explains how the myths of different cultures and religions relate to each other, so to understand that everyone learns very similar stories about rites of passage and growing up, no matter what beliefs they grew up around.  This connection is meaningful to those who want to understand more about religions and how they intertwine with one another.  Myth is also shown to be extremely helpful in modern lives today, to help us live through obstacles.  Mythology is displayed as a useful guide in life throughout many different cultures.
	However, the book also had its downfalls.  This would not be the best choice for a reader who would rather keep the symbols and structures of myth a mystery to them so they can infer that information for themselves.  Also, if the reader would rather read a story or something with a plot, this is not the book for them.  This book merely explains those plots of other myths, which is no simple feat either.  This book was written to inform rather than for pleasure reading, but it is an excellent book to have on the shelf for reference.
	Joseph Campbell's The Power of Myth was a powerful read and will most likely be read again.  I'd give this non-fiction novel four stars out of five, and five stars for how meaningful and educational it was."
The Power of Myth,0385418868,"Joseph Campbell, Bill Moyers",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Aeon_of_the_Ages,"I really love this book, and am glad they kept it in interview format so as not to miss a single, well-placed word! Joseph Campbell really got it right, and Bill Moyers asks all the imperative questions. A perfect guide to proper mythology, both modern and ancient; essential for creators of fiction, and students of life! Thought-provoking and compelling.. Timeless and pertinent... Thrilling and intense... A truly great read, and very educational. EVERYONE should read this book! (Or watch the DVD!)

I understand that they may have seemingly little relation to PoM, but, they're all essential to me in regards to understanding the universe, and how we fit into it. Enjoy!"
"Lock In (Lock In, #1)",0765375869,John Scalzi,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"Scalzi likes to try his hand at different things and challenge himself to stretch as a writer. He tried rebooting a classic '60s St novel,  he tried releasing a serialized ebook novel, he tried a satire of bad Sci-Fi TV, and now he' so trying a near future police procedural thriller. He always succeeds and now he's done it again."
"Lock In (Lock In, #1)",0765375869,John Scalzi,Barnes and Noble,4.2,MaggieJones,"Lock In is a fantastic read! It is well written, easy to understand, believable and above all&hellip; INTERESTING! It has been awhile since I have read something that was interesting to me on an intellectual level. There is plenty of pseudo-science, and what-if type writing in this novel, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.




This is the story of the world after the onset of a terrible disease called Haden&rsquo;s Syndrome. A large percentage of the world contracted this flu-like illness and perished immediately. A percentage of those that survived contracted the second form of the disease, akin to meningitis. Most of the people who survive this faze of the disease experience what they call &ldquo;Lock In,&rdquo; which is a complete loss of control of their bodies but still having complete mental faculties.




Technology companies that were in existence at the time had tons of money and resources thrown at them so they could try to make a way for those who were &ldquo;locked in&rdquo; to be able to communicate. The solution is elegantly simple: Adding a second, neural processing unit that attaches to the brain directly and allows the use of a robot remotely controlled. These &ldquo;hadens&rdquo; were then able to function and communicate in the world with everybody else. Hadens also have access to a virtual world, Agora, where Hadens can socialize amongst themselves. People who contracted the second phase of Haden&rsquo;s Syndrome but don&rsquo;t experience &ldquo;Lock In&rdquo; are able to have the neural implant and allow possession of their body by a Haden who would like to experience something in an actual body. They are called Integrators, and they are a valuable resource and fairly rare.




In Lock In, there is a wonderful cast of characters. They are interesting and well written. This is one of those novels that feels like a possible future, and I appreciate that! It makes me look at how our society is now, and wonder if we could indeed survive such a devastating outbreak. It brings up questions about profiting from illnesses and if that is a conflict of interest to those who are in the best position to help.




I certainly hope that there will be more novels in this world. It is a complete story in and of itself, though, and could go either way. Read it sooner rather than later! This one definitely has movie potential."

Longbourn,0385351232,Jo Baker,Barnes and Noble,3.6,clahain1,"I wasn't so sure about this one at first. Considering all the Austen sequels, prequels, and re-tellings 
that have appeared in the past couple of years alone, it's hard to stand out, to somehow make a 
classic like Pride &amp; Prejudice new. Literary writers have it harder than those turning the book into a 
contemporary romance or a murder mystery, because the result has to be more than ephemeral 
entertainment, it has to actually mean something. At the same time, this is Jane Austen--get too heavy
 and your audience will riot. Just ask writer/director Patricia Rozema, who tried to insert a bit of 
historical relevance into her 1999 feature film version of Mansfield Park, treating viewers to hints of 
Sir Betram's untoward relations with the female slaves on his Antigua plantation and Lady Bertram's 
addiction to the opiate laudanum. Austen lovers were not amused.

Author Jo Baker manages to tread the fine line between literary merit and pure reading enjoyment. 
She does this by essentially turning Pride &amp; Prejudice on its head. The Bennets, Darcys, and Binglys 
become minor characters in a drama centering on their normally invisible maids, housekeepers and 
footmen. In reality, we aren't getting a retelling of a classic at all but a largely original work.

The plot centers around housemaid Sarah and James Smith, the natural (illegitimate) son of 
housekeeper Mrs. Hill and Mr. Bennet, master of an estate that will be entailed away from his heirs 
because none of the legitimate ones are male. It's this beautiful and tragic irony that provides the 
central thread of the novel. Baker does a great job recreating the daily grind of life in service during the 
regency period. Her descriptions of maids washing their mistresses' filthy menstrual rags and carrying
 sloshing chamber pots down staircases and through endless twisting corridors on the way to the 
outdoor &quot;necessary&quot; house brings us right into that cold, aching, stinking world. Yet Baker works to 
present us with rounded human beings rather than stick figure examples of the evils of social 
inequality. There's plenty righteous indignation on the part of the servants for their employers' often 
frivolous demands on their time and energy, but also genuine care and concern flow both upstairs 
and down.

Where Baker does go wrong is in the beginning of volume three of the book, when the action at 
Longbourn stops dead and we are treated to an exhausting flashback of James's experiences as a
 gunner in Portugal and Spain. Three chapters of violence, hunger and sexual exploitation that lead 
us....where? We already know the footman has an unhappy past and is wary of being noticed by 
soldiers of the militia staying in Meryton. And, through two taut interactions with the noxious and 
conniving Wickham, we get enough detail to set up the coming plot turns. The flashback is gratuitous
 and undercuts the novel at the very point when it should be the tightest and most dramatic.

Luckily, Baker does get back to Longbourn and even takes us beyond the end of Pride &amp; Prejudice, 
so we get to follow James, Sarah, Polly, and Mrs. Hill a little way into their futures. Here's where the 
book really succeeds. Baker's servant class characters are as fascinating to spend time with as 
Austen's elegant creations and, by the end, we're just as sorry to say goodbye to them."
Longbourn,0385351232,Jo Baker,Barnes and Noble,3.6,MommaG,"This is not just another P&P variation.  This book stands apart from all of the sequals, prequals and variations.  It is not another story of the Bennets and Darcys but a story of the average person and the not so romantic real life of everyday Regency England.  The story of Sarah, James and Mr. and Mrs. Hill changes how we think of the ""gentle"" class of Bennets.  Mrs. Hill who is always portrayed as Mrs. Bennet's crutch becomes a person with a past and a present and secrets that have a lasting affect on the members of the Bennet family.  Elizabeth, while not a Caroline Bingley looking down her nose at the world, is unaware that others are not there to do her bidding.  Elizabeth,as an extension of Darcy's arrogance and entitlement, is unable to understand why Sarah is unhappy with being separated from those she loves.  The history and the lives of those that serve provide another look into this period and another view of some of our favorites.  
The characters of Sarah, the Hills and James are real.  I fell for James and his kindness and pain and Sarah as she matured and realized that there was more for her life if she took control.  
I loved this book and will read it again and again.  Jo Baker's characters are alive and moving.  Excellant, excellant book."

"Backstage Pass (Sinners on Tour, #1)",1402244428,Olivia Cunning,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"This was not good i could not finish this book. I had to stop at page 58. Waste of money. If you like reading about a professional that comes across a band and is sexually abused by this band ,then this is your cup of erotica. This was flat out nasty and disrespectful to a woman and her values. This woman was not normal in the head as this author writes."
"Backstage Pass (Sinners on Tour, #1)",1402244428,Olivia Cunning,Barnes and Noble,4.4,missy168,Great book if you are interested in a love story with great sex scenes !!! can not wait to start the second book:)) enjoy enjoy enjoy !!
"Backstage Pass (Sinners on Tour, #1)",1402244428,Olivia Cunning,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Andreat78,"So once again, I've hit a book that is almost too much for my poor brain to wrap around. I am on sensory overload. So I am going to break this baby down into two segments: the story and the sex. Sound good? Let's do this!

The story. Myrna is a sexual behavior professor at a conference. She happens to see members of her favorite band, Sinners, having a great time drinking in the hotel. She introduces herself to the band, and quickly becomes acquainted with them. They would all love to get down with her, but she has her eyes on Master Sinclair, lead guitarist. Brian &quot;Master&quot; Sinclair is actually the master at getting his heart broken. He repeatedly falls for his girlfriends, only to have his heart stomped on when they cheat, usually with his bandmates. When he meets Myrna, Brian is immediately smitten. He falls hard for the beautiful professor with an exciting sexual appetite. The problem is, Myrna doesn't want love. She only wants right now. So Brian sets out to win Myrna's heart. To give her a reason to stay with him. Forever. 

BACKSTAGE PASS was a terrific story. I love a great romance with a strong, secure female lead. Myrna is a force. She knows what she wants, in life and in the bedroom. Her lack of naivete was a welcome change from what I typically see in romance novels. Brian was beyond wonderful. I'm a firm believer that there are fewer things in life sexier than rock stars. When you add the fact that Brian is a hopeless romantic, a one woman man..well, that just seals the deal for me. I absolutely loved him. The road these two take, in getting to really know one another, the give-and-take that transpires as they slowly build a relationship, was gorgeous. I loved that author Olivia Cunning really took her time with Brian and Myrna. Stories like that make the payoff so much sweeter.


Now for the smexy times. *rubs hands together* This is one. hot. book. HOT! Listen, you know how I just said that rock stars are the sexiest things ever? Scratch that. Rock stars who hear music when they're making love and use their lover's body to write the notes on are the hottest things ever. Ever. I just...my brain wants to 'splode when I imagine it. Hot. As for the adventures of Myrna and Brian. Talk about wild. I totally felt like I should take notes while I was reading. Myrna is determined to explore every naughty fantasy she's ever had. Brian is more than willing to share them with her. I have to admire her, the woman knows what she wants and has the cajones to say it. I won't go into all the naughty bits, and there are a lot. Let's just say I will never look at cherry suckers the same way ever again. *falls over dead*

It would be an epic understatement to say I really liked this book. BACKSTAGE PASS is a book I shall re-read many times, probably when I need a good pick-me-up. I am ridiculously excited to read book two, ROCK HARD. I already have book three, DOUBLE TIME, on pre-order. Olivia Cunning is now an &quot;auto buy&quot; author for me. So if you like hot guys, strong women and sexy times, this series is for you!"

Bastard Out of Carolina,0452287057,Dorothy Allison,Barnes and Noble,4.3,songcatchers,"Bastard Out of Carolina tells the tale of a young girl named Bone. Hers is a tale of physical and sexual abuse that grows steadily more violent until the explosive end of the book. It's also about her family, the Boatwrights. The big scary uncles, who adore Bone, are always drunk and shoot up each others trucks for fun. And the aunts, who always stick together whether they are picking over beans or taking care of each others children. Bone is a happy little girl until her mother gets married to Daddy Glen. Daddy Glen is very gentle with Bone at first. Things gradually go bad though when he starts physically abusing and molesting Bone. Bastard Out of Carolina is about the decisions we all make and the effects of those decisions on your children. It's about the meaning of family and loyalty. This is a serious book dealing with some hard subject matter. It's never easy to read about abuse, especially when it's a child involved, but Bastard Out of Carolina is definitely worth a read."

I felt the writing and character development was excellent.  I grew up in the Carolinas, and I would not be surprised at how many 'real' domestic situations exist, that are exactly like this one.  I no longer live in the South, and although I am proud to have grown up there and love my family, some of the 'backwoods' thought processes are far too common there. I was very unsympathetic to the young mother in this story, and the way that she dealt with Bone's abusive relationship with Glen. I hated Glen's character, but I hated the young mother even more for allowing it."
Beauty Queens,0439895979,Libba Bray,Barnes and Noble,3.8,epicrat,"Wow. I may not have been a crazy stalker fan of Libba Bray beforehand (the Gemma Doyle series didn't do anything for me - yes, you may duct-tape me now), but I think Beauty Queens has me wondering what crazy schemes this author will cook up next because I'm pretty sure that I will be in that serving line! Even if it is chicken-tasting grub from some random island.

I realize that this book may not be for everyone - I wasn't even 1% sure if Beauty Queens would be my cup of tea. Yes, I was that uncertain of it. I kept glancing at the book in the bookstores, admiring the lipstick bullet belt concept, but unsure if I was ready for a leap of faith. So I borrowed it from the library and took the book out for a spin.

And holy smokes! Did Beauty Queens grab my attention from the get-go and shook me silly in a similar fashion that Miss Congeniality did? Except 200% more to the power of infinity and whatever goes beyond that? I think flying toasters might be involved in the beyond.

As far-fetched as Beauty Queens may sound, Libba Bray really applies her witty parody quite liberally like sunscreen - and I loved all her shout-outs and snark-outs that celebrated (or eulogized) all things pop culture. Everything was outrageous - everything, that is, except the message that it is okay to be yourself, even if that includes a little crazy or ugly or random. I cannot imagine how much FUN Ms. Bray had with re-inventing the world of pop culture because they are truly quite clever!

What really impressed me with Beauty Queens is how the girls were introduced to the readers via pageant bios and then the next chapter focused on digging deep into what makes them tick, even though everything was told in third-person. It really gave me enough time to connect with each girl and then gradually tie them as one large group into the main story arc. With so many characters to juggle around and decide who gets centerstage for certain moments, I give props to Libba Bray for managing to find a way to make it easy for the readers to befriend the characters. It almost felt like 4 years of high school with a class of 200+ individuals - you start off as strangers, but leave as one big family.

I think Libba Bray may very well be the next Douglas Adams or Joseph Heller in my book. Not a whole lot of authors can serve such a ridiculous dish of random that makes me clutch my stomach from laughing too hard and yet I couldn't stop from devouring the pages!

And for your reading pleasure (in truth, this is for my own because I probably inhaled a pepperoni up my nose when I read this snippet), bar none my favoritest quote from the book because the delivery is GOLDEN:

    ""I count the time like my hemorrhoids.""

I've never been one for online gaming myself.....not that I am opposed to it on any moral grounds....I've just found that for myself I am easily addicted to computer games and never had the time to get lost inside a computer game (maybe it is the fear that I will get lost.....or the knowledge that I WILL be easily lost in the pixels of an artificial reality)

whatever the reason I found the subject and presentation of this book an amazing read that entertained and was thought provoking as well. I loved it and couldn't recommend it more."
The Burden of Proof,0446677124,Scott Turow,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Anonymous,"This book is not a fast-moving mystery-thriller like Presumed Innocent and you can't compare the two. It is a deliberate, thoughtful novel with wonderful, insightful character development. For many years, whenever I needed to enter a security question on a website I always answered ""What is your favorite book?"" with this one. As a woman in her 30's when I read Burden of Proof, I was amazed that the author made me care so deeply about this melancholy older man, Sandy, and his struggle to solve a personal mystery and begin a new life."
The Burden of Proof,0446677124,Scott Turow,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Guest,"I purchased this book at the same time as 'Pressumed Innocent'. I read Pressumed Innocent first. That book blew me away, an amazing read and even greater ending. But with 'Burden of Proof', I have been unable to flip pages as quickly. It is just hard to get into. I was expecting to get drawn into this 'great' story as before, but unfortunately it just hasn't happened."
The Burden of Proof,0446677124,Scott Turow,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Anagarika-Sean on LibraryThing,Another great one by Mr. Turow! I wish I had the time to read the rest of the books he's written. Maybe one day.
The Stars My Destination,0679767800,"Alfred Bester, Neil Gaiman",Barnes and Noble,4.1,cwms,"iBooks seems to have failed to do any correction of errors from scanning in the digital version. On every page, many words have a space in the middle of them causing the words to break across pages. Certain characters from the book are incorrectly translated to the electronic version (an O with a cross at the bottom turns into a subscript T). I only got through 25 pages before it annoyed me enough to stop reading, at least on the nook. Maybe I'll find it electronically at some other store minus the errors, or just go with the print version.

I think the book itself is probably good (I enjoyed the beginning), but the formatting issues made it too annoying to read, for me."
The Stars My Destination,0679767800,"Alfred Bester, Neil Gaiman",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"I have always seen this book listed on best of lists.  I thought nothing of it.  I thought it would be another old style sci-fi romp in the style of Heinlein or Asimov.  It's not.  It reads like it was written this year.  Now I see where William Gibson got his start, Neal Stephenson too.  This is cyberpunk without computers.  It's dark, brooding, and probably the most imaginative piece of fiction I've ever read.  Remember that scene at the end of the matrix where he stands up and flexs and the hallways wobbles...remember how cool that was?  This entire book is that cool."
The Stars My Destination,0679767800,"Alfred Bester, Neil Gaiman",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"Tiger, Tiger!(Published the following year in the US as Stars My Destination) is for most, one of the best science fiction novels and for me, THE best science fiction novel ever written.  In all his works, even the lesser ones, Alfred Bester's trademark is how engaging his characters are.  Stars my Destination is one of the great works of the genre that does not focus on an individual event, but on characters.  True, this book could not exist without an interplanetary war nor the advent of Jaunting(a telekinetic triggered quantum tunneling mode of transport is the best description I make) however this story is about Gully Foyle.  A gradual transformation of him from a brutish man to well...you really must read it.  This book speaks of the value of education as his character's moral substance grows from microscopic to universal due to his absorbtion of knowledge.  He cannot help but become a better person for the aquiring of it even though his original goal was for pure vengence and was driven by reaction.  This is one of literature's best examples of the lengths of unnoticed potential that lies within each person.  I believe the most significant contribution of this novel however, is the vocalization of the idea that the will to destroy is no less dangerous than destruction itself.  I write of the weapon sought after by all in the book.  As this involves a key plot point I do not feel at liberty to scribble about it further.  Those are only two of the many characteristics of this novel that set it apart from other science fiction.  Only one part of the book could be called dated (Dagenheim's impossible physical anomaly) which in itself screams loudly of the quality of writing.  To end, I consider this the best novel in it's genre and one of the best books written in the last century.  That may seem a little extreme even to some who have read it.  But having read the book several times, I cannnot help but find it an accurate phrase.  This book should be read twice, once for the incredibly entertaining style of Bester's writing, and again for the thoughts that occur behind the action."
"Cruel Beauty (Cruel Beauty Universe, #1)",0062224735,Rosamund Hodge,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Brooke-The-Cover-Contessa,"I want to thank Balzer and Bray (Harper Teen) for sending me a copy of this book to read and give an honest review. Receiving this book for free has in no way influenced my opinion or review.




So, I'll be honest from the get go and let you know that I did not read the blurb for this book prior to reading it. I loved the cover and heard so many people praising it, I just had to read it. So, when the chance presented itself, I jumped right in.




To not mention the cover would be a sin. So there I go. It's just gorgeous. I love the color scheme and imagery. It's really quite fantastic. So just by looking at this cover I wanted to read the book!




I'm a huge fan of fairy tale retellings. Or any retellings, to be honest. I love to see how authors take what I know and twist and turn it into something that it totally and completely unique. Hodge does this in such a great way. While I had heard it was a Beauty and the Beast retelling, I can honestly say while there are definitely underlying themes of this story, it is totally different and new. And I really didn't fell like I was reading a retelling but rather I was reading a unique story about a young girl who is sent to her death only to meet and fall in love with the man she should be set to kill. It's dark and twisty and romantic and amazing.




Nyx is such a strong character. I love how she is determined to find a way to save everyone. She begins her trek as a selfless person, hell bent on making sure her town becomes free. I really loved this character. She is strong and stoic. She does have very strong opinions and sometimes those get in her. While she wants to be good, she has this underlying darkness that is itching to break free. And she's snarky and sarcastic, which works well with the other main characters: Ignifex and Shade.
Ignifex and Shade, two sides of the same coin it seems. Ignifex is the monster, hell bent on containing Nyx's village of Arcadia. Shade, on the other hand, has a hand in wanting Nyx to free the city. Ignifex is all that is dark and brooding in a character. I really loved him from the very start. He was snarky and fun, a great compliment to Nyx. I seem to be drawn to the &quot;bad guy&quot; in books more often than the gentle souls that are portrayed as the best boyfriend material. This is Shade. He is loving and gentle side of the coin. He shows Nyx things she would not otherwise be able to see.
I will say that Nyx's sister, Astraia, really made me mad. I just didn't like her at all. In the beginning of the book she's so childish compared to her twin. I just can't understand how she could be so different. But later on in the book we see another side of her, one I was not expecting at all. It was liked she flipped a switch and became a different character. And I hated what she asked of Nyx.




The plot of this book is completely amazing. For the first three or four chapters, Hodge hits us with a lot of world building. I almost felt it was going to be a book full of info-dump. But I quickly learned that all this was necessary so that I could understand why Nyx needed to marry the Gentle Lord (demon lord, really, not sure of the name Gentle since he's anything but!). It's an intricate story of twists and turns, with slow reveals of information that peel back layers as reveal truths. Hodge also infuses a lot of Greek Mythology into this book: The River Styx, Pandora's Box and a bit of high fantasy.




And Hodge's writing, just...WOW. I am not sure I can adequately describe how rich and fulfilling it was to read her words. She paints pictures that are very vivid and real. She makes things complex and intriguing. There are some areas that I had to re-read in order to really grasp the ideas and understand what was going on, but it did't deter me from wanting to continue and figure out just what was going on.




All in all this book was absolutely fabulous. A fantastic debut novel. It's totally original and there's no way that my review would ever be able to truly capture its power. I urge you to pick it up, and read, and keep reading, and then finish reading and sigh as I did when you put it down at the finale! I'm really looking forward to Gilded Ashes and anything else Hodge decides to write. She has pushed her way into my top author list for sure!"
"Cruel Beauty (Cruel Beauty Universe, #1)",0062224735,Rosamund Hodge,Barnes and Noble,4.1,book4children,"If you are looking for your next addictive YA fantasy, this could be it. Cruel Beauty has an intricate plot with complicated, twisted characters. Nobody is who they appear to be. There is so much going on in the story that it is easy to get swept away into this world of bargains and deceit, where answers lay hidden and just out of reach.

The writing is gorgeous. The author manages to describe events and feelings in a way that I've never seen before. The relationships between all the characters is a fascinating web of hatred, love, lies, and truth.

While the book isn't entirely perfect, it is pretty darn close. It's the timeless romance story that every girl loves.

Content: Violence and innuendo"
"Cruel Beauty (Cruel Beauty Universe, #1)",0062224735,Rosamund Hodge,Barnes and Noble,4.1,hrschic,"I did not receive a free copy of this book. I do not know the author. This is an exceptional book. Period. Much more for a first novel. Enough twists and turns to keep the 
mental gears grinding. Not so many as to lose the reader. A heroine to cheer for. A hero to love. a quick pace, but not rushed. Kudos, Ms. Hodge
I hope to read more of your stories in the future."
"The Rise of Endymion (Hyperion Cantos, #4)",0553572989,Dan Simmons,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,This was probably the best of the series. There were so many suprises and it even tells of the origin of the Shrike. I was on the edge of my seat for the other three books but with this one i fell off of my seat. The ending was satisfying and the series is a must read for anybody that is a human.
"The Rise of Endymion (Hyperion Cantos, #4)",0553572989,Dan Simmons,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,Great ending to a wonderful series though it was a bit wordier than Hyperion and the Fall of Hyperion.  I would like to see Mr. Simmons write just one more book in this series in order to wrap-up a few loose ends.
"The Rise of Endymion (Hyperion Cantos, #4)",0553572989,Dan Simmons,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"This was a great book, the story was wonderful, and it had all the elements of a story that when you finish you just wish there were more to read."
"Endymion (Hyperion Cantos, #3)",0553572946,Dan Simmons,Barnes and Noble,4.4,DaveG_GA,"I heard about the Hyperion series from Slice Of Sci-Fi.  This is a must read series.  I have all but absorbed the first three books in this series and am currently getting through the 4th in the series.

Excellent read!"
"Endymion (Hyperion Cantos, #3)",0553572946,Dan Simmons,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"Hyperion was good by itself, I would have been satisfied with it alone.  The story continuing after the Fall of Hyperion further elaborates upon the nature of the antagonists in humanity's struggle to reconcile itself after The Fall. Events from the first two books that seemed to stand alone (and could in their own right) begin to have greater meaning. Good read. The Church's role in this part of the story stands to point out the dangers that can be found in extremist beliefs and the possibility of stagnation through complacency, both physically and spiritually."
"Endymion (Hyperion Cantos, #3)",0553572946,Dan Simmons,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"Though not nearly as entertaining or thought provoking as the previous two books in the Hyperion Cantos, this is still a great book.  Raul Endymion is a nice addition to the tapestry of characters, as is Aenea, and the changes in the overall setting are chilling.  The Shrike in this book, while still a menacing figure, seems more heroic than before."
The Arrival,0734406940,Shaun Tan,Barnes and Noble,4.5,cloggiedownunder,"The Arrival is a graphic novel for young readers by award-winning Australian illustrator and author, Shaun Tan. The father is packing his case, taking his leave of his wife and daughter to travel far away. There’s the hint of something threatening that makes this necessary. A train journey, a ship takes him (and many others) a long way away (it must be a long way because there are sixty different cloud formations seen). 

Then they arrive, are processed, and suddenly, here he is, on his own, away from everything familiar. He needs a place to stay, food to eat, a job. But when he asks a local, they are helpful and friendly. He somehow acquires a helpful pet. Others, refugees too, who have come before him, share their stories of what they left behind. He is welcomed. He works hard, and eventually, he can send money to his family, so they can join him. 

Shaun Tan is such a talented artist and author! Without any words (well, any in a known language, at least) he tells this moving and heart-warming story. The pictures are evocative: from the passport photos on the endpapers, to the tiny images of detail that draw back to show their place in a larger image, to the stains and creases that make it look like a well-used travel document, to the fantastically different place of arrival, all are wonderfully done.  

It’s a story that those people who are grumbling about refugees need to read. And for anyone who has come from their home to settle in a strange land, a place where they know no-one, where the people dress differently, where the food and drink, the animals, the climate, the language, the customs and the people are all different from what they know, for these people, the story Tan so eloquently conveys with his art will strike a chord. Utterly brilliant!"
The Arrival,0734406940,Shaun Tan,Barnes and Noble,4.5,countrylife on LibraryThing,"I don't remember ever reading a graphic novel before, but, WOW, this was excellent!  The drawings were stunning; the story compelling and life-like, even though set in a fantastical time and place.  It is the old story ¿ during hard times, one member of the family leaves to find work.  The immigrant misses his family, and faces the hardship of not understanding language or custom in his new surroundings.  He encounters the kindness of strangers, who share their own immigrant story and help him to find lodging and work. Seasons pass, strangers become friends, and he is finally able to send for his family.  The author did a marvelous job of portraying many ethnicities and cultures converging in the new world, most helpful to newcomers, who themselves learn and help others.  Beautiful!"
The Arrival,0734406940,Shaun Tan,Barnes and Noble,4.5,booksandwine on LibraryThing,"The Arrival by Shaun Tan is a wordless graphic novel about a man who immigrates to another country in order to obtain and forge a better life for his family.One thing that struck me about The Arrival was how imaginative it is. The art is beautiful and so creative. The world pictured in this book is not our world. There are different types of creatures which resemble pets, different sorts of buildings. I loved it! I wonder if these imaginings fall under steampunk or not?To further elaborate on the pictures, I thought they were deeply emotional. The feelings just crawl off the page. When the main character is missing his family, you don't need to read words to understand, it's all in the picture.I thought the lack of words lends to the universality of this book. Pictures are something any human can understand, unless of course you are blind."
"Calamity (The Reckoners, #3)",0385743602,Brandon Sanderson,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,I have been waiting forever for this... the whole book has me turning pages constantly.

Shopgirl,0786891076,Steve Martin,Barnes and Noble,3.8,margieb,"This offbeat romance was delightful. Mr. Martin's writing style is fresh and engaging.  The book was a quick and easy read, but there was excellent character development.  It was laugh out loud funny in parts, but also very poignant.  I frequently found myself re-reading certain lines because I loved the unique way in which they were written.  It is intelligent and does not have the pat ending of many other light romance stories.  It is probably more accurately described as a novella than a book, but the length seemed just right for the story.  I look forward to reading more stories by Steve Martin if they are as sharp, witty and quirky as this one."
Shopgirl,0786891076,Steve Martin,Barnes and Noble,3.8,songcatchers,"Shopgirl is an amusing character study. Mirabelle, a 28 year old, is kind of stuck in a post-college pre-career limbo. She gets involved with two different men; Ray Porter, a millionaire in his 50's and Jeremy, a 20 something who still acts like a teenager. Each of these men have faults as well as redeeming qualities. Mirabelle gets her heart broken but in the end, she finds happiness. Shopgirl has truly hilarious episodes. It has a more somber side though when we see the effects of giving yourself totally to someone only to have them take a tiny piece of you. I really like these characters, they are quite quirky. Overall, Shopgirl is an entertaining novella but I enjoyed the movie more."
Shopgirl,0786891076,Steve Martin,Barnes and Noble,3.8,LovesPrint,"it's beautiful. read it. Based on how much I loved this book, I bought The Pleasure of my Company, and An Object of Beauty; his gentle humor in the event of ridiculous circumstance is what I keep coming back for. He reminds me of a modern-day Somerset Maugham."
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer & Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,0451528646,Mark Twain,Barnes and Noble,4.4,shanda1021 on LibraryThing,Summary: This is the story of a very imaginative young boy and his best friend and their many tall tales.Personal Reaction:I remember reading this at a very young age and loving it.Classroom Extensions:1.  This is a good book to read when teaching about classic books.2.  I would use this as a book to read to my class as entertainment.
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer & Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,0451528646,Mark Twain,Barnes and Noble,4.4,tonyasbooks on LibraryThing,"Tom Sawyer is pure fun, but Huckleberry Finn is the real treasure. Mark Twain's grasp of the various Southern dialects is amazingly true to life, and in Adventures of Huckleberry Finn he satirizes many aspects of that region in the antebellum era, such as superstitions, societal teachings, and family honor. The author underwent a complete transformation in how he viewed blacks between the time he wrote Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn, and it is interesting to see how the character of Tom Sawyer changes from an innocent troublemaker to a mean-spirited, ""adventure""-seeking adolescent. I read The Adventures of Tom Sawyer for fun in elementary school, and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn for my high school senior English class, and because of that, I recommend that you follow along the story on SparkNotes (or a similar guide) because it may reveal to you some insight into the time period or into Twain's satire that you would not have picked up on your own."
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer & Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,0451528646,Mark Twain,Barnes and Noble,4.4,wareaglern633 on LibraryThing,I think this is a must read for every child.

The Woman Upstairs,0307596907,Claire Messud,Barnes and Noble,2.8,Mamma_Librarian,"This is a book that made me ponder about the things that are important. Nora is a character that you can relate to (even if you don't have a budding artist inside you). 
The themes are contemporary, but not cliched. The writing is amazing. Not sure what the one reviewer meant about pedantic--because it is exactly the opposite of that. 
So sad to see this book with a 3 stars because of it. I'm a librarian and I know what I'm talking about."
The Woman Upstairs,0307596907,Claire Messud,Barnes and Noble,2.8,Anonymous,"Funny, angry, intense---riveting!
And with a most natural-sounding writing style. The sentences flow like sweet water."
The Woman Upstairs,0307596907,Claire Messud,Barnes and Noble,2.8,Anonymous,"I thought this book captured so many emotions from disturbing to humorous.  Rarely is an author able to probe the depths of a character's psyche in the way Massud accomplishes with Nora.  A truly well told tale spun from the innermost thoughts of a middle-aged woman seeking to find meaning in her life.  Excellent read.  I cannot understand the negative reviews, as I was totally mesmerized!"
"The Stupidest Angel: A Heartwarming Tale of Christmas Terror (Pine Cove, #3)",0060842350,Christopher Moore,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"I like this author's work.  I listened to a recorded version and found myself wondering if he and I knew some of the same people!  Religious folks who are easily offended should probably avoid this one, though the ""stupidest angel"" in question isn't the central character.  A good, funny, light read."
"The Stupidest Angel: A Heartwarming Tale of Christmas Terror (Pine Cove, #3)",0060842350,Christopher Moore,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"As others have noted, this book is not for the easily offended. If it were a movie, I'd expect an 'R' rating for language, adult-content and violence. (Heresy and sacrelige do not show on movie ratings, but consider yourself warned.)
I could barely control laughing out loud while reading this. The analogies, characters, story-line and everything else conceivable had me gaffawing like a psychotic hyena on meth."
"The Stupidest Angel: A Heartwarming Tale of Christmas Terror (Pine Cove, #3)",0060842350,Christopher Moore,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"Definitely not a lighthearted book for sensitive people. It is warped, a bit raunchy, very rowdy and really really funny."
Carolina Moon,0515130389,Nora Roberts,Barnes and Noble,4.4,seminoelgal,"This is one of my favorite books.  A young woman who is psychic returns home to find answers concerning the murder/rape of her friend when she was a child. She discovers that the murderer has continued to rape and murder on the anniversary of the death of her friend. This books has suspense, romance and a very good ending. I am so happy it is  in ebk form so I can have it available anytime."
Carolina Moon,0515130389,Nora Roberts,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"I love this book so much it is my all time favorite Nora Roberts book. I re read it often and have all ready worn out one copy. Tory is such a great character and Cade is absolutely someone to moon over. Faith is a force to be reckoned with and probably brings the best laughs out of the book. I also love how the friendship between Faith and Tory grows. It's a great mystery and a great love story. This wasn't my first Nora Roberts book, but like I said it is definately my favorite."
Carolina Moon,0515130389,Nora Roberts,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Ray080,"This book is somewhat similar to Carnal Innocence.
 
Don't worry though, it is not entirely the same. I love the characters in this novel, specially Wade and Faith. Nora Roberts certainly knows how to give appealing twist to every persona she writes about. I suggest that you read this book and you'll know that Ms. Roberts will never fail to entertain and hook you up in her cleverly plotted stories."
The Painted Girls,1594486247,Cathy Marie Buchanan,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"The Painted Girls is a brilliantly written historical fiction set in Paris in the 1880's. A story about the lives of sisters trying to make their way through life under less than ideal circumstances. Do the girls have control over their destiny or is it fate that delegates their position in life? Intertwining the tale of the sisters' lives and true facts from historical documents, paintings, ballets, plays, sculpture, murder trials and more this notion is explored. A true page turner! This book filled with sister love and rivalry had me hooked from beginning to end. An utterly captivating read!"
The Painted Girls,1594486247,Cathy Marie Buchanan,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"I'm fascinated by ballet, so was intrigued with the idea of the book about the 'behind-the-scenes' story of Degas's sculpture of the little dancer. While rich in details, the book felt disjointed and the characters remained flat. I can't even call the characters 2-dimensional, because I didn't get any picture at all, as if there were no substance to Marie or to Antoinette. The relationship between Marie the little ballerina and Degas didn't even make it to a side-story in my mind, much to my disappointment. 

On the other hand, the book succeeded in depicting the incredible vulnerability of being female, poor, and young at that time. It made me shudder to imagine my own daughter growing up in Marie's or Antoinette's shoes. And the afterwards about the historical people and events that inspired this book was very interesting."
The Painted Girls,1594486247,Cathy Marie Buchanan,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"Cathy Marie Buchanan has made Degas' paintings come alive.  The juxtaposition of the ugly, gritty backstage life of the Paris Theater life in the late 1800s with the beauty and grandeur of the stage creates a very full, rich world.  
I would love to have an illustrated version with all of the works of art alluded to."
"The Talented Mr. Ripley (Ripley, #1)",0393332144,Patricia Highsmith,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Mr.Krinkle,Most stories need a hero and a villain. Mr. Tom Ripley is suprisingly both. A true gem is this novel. Pay close atenttion to the discrepencies that contrast book and movie. Ripley's sexualallity is not questionable (to me) - his threshold to avoid detection and capture are. Is there anything he won't or can't do? Balls to the wall! I have read over 120 books and this one has the most suspense.
"The Talented Mr. Ripley (Ripley, #1)",0393332144,Patricia Highsmith,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,The only bad thing is I saw this movie before I read the book so I knew what was going to happen.

"Noble House (Asian Saga, #5)",0440164842,James Clavell,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"This is a book I read over twenty years ago and I'm ready to read it again. I lived in this book and was constantly learning little things about Eurasians and Asian culture while reading it, totally fascinated the whole time I read it, and very sad to turn the last page -- wishing this book would go on for at least 4 more 1,200-page volumes. I have read most of Clavell's other books, and they were all a letdown to me after reading this book. That critic who made fun of this book and put it down is sooo full of baloney! If I find 3 other novels in my lifetime as entertaining, educational and fun to read as this one, (and as long), I'll be a happy woman."
"Noble House (Asian Saga, #5)",0440164842,James Clavell,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,This book was great!  It was as satisfying to read as Shogun.  The characters (and their colloquial expressions!) are very colorful.  The book is filled with so many amazing ingredients of drama.  The tragic ending was very powerful and reminded me of some of the writings of the famous Russian writers.  This book is worth reading over and over!

I know of at least 3 of them that started with this one and have followed the rest of the series all the way through like I have.  Christine Feehan makes you love the characters so much that you just can't put the books down because you want to know what's going to happen to them in the end.

"Dark Prince (Dark, #1)",0843955287,Christine Feehan,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Leigh30,"I just finished reading this book and truly enjoyed it. I had never previously read anything by Christine Feehan but I had seen her name floating about the paranormal romance sections, which I've been reading a lot of lately. So I thought I would read one of her books and decided to start on this one first. I love Mikhail and Raven's story, they kind of reminded me of Edward and Bella in the ""Twilight Series"" by Stephenie Meyer. I don't know if there is a sequel to this book or not but I hope there is because I would love to know what happens to them next. Great read and looking forward to reading more by Feehan."
The Shining Girls,0316216852,Lauren Beukes,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Anonymous,"Master wordsmith and tight plotting make this an immensely satisfying read.  I'm not a fan of the overly gruesome scenes, so I skimmed those.  Despite the jumping around, it fits together seamlessly like the Escher stairs."
The Shining Girls,0316216852,Lauren Beukes,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Anonymous,"Don't question how it happens, but a serial killer finds a way to travel through time and find victims when they are young girls and then find them once they have grown and kill them in disgusting ways.  But one of the girls who ""shine"" lives and turns the tables on the killer.  A fast paced and fun read."
The Shining Girls,0316216852,Lauren Beukes,Barnes and Noble,3.7,ReadersFavorite,"Reviewed by Brenda Ballard for Readers' Favorite

The Shining Girls: A Novel by Lauren Beukes is something for the iron gut, thrill-seeking reader. Harper Curtis is one sick dude whose actions are propelled by the call of The House. It is not just any house. This one enables him to time travel, which really helps when you don't want to be found. A serial killer who finds his prey young then springs forward to snuff them out at an older age; it is the perfect getaway. Who would believe it, anyway? His marks are many and his calling card unique. An item from the future left next to their dead bodies means nothing to detectives and goes unnoticed until somebody discovers the pattern. She is the only survivor of his throat slashing habit and quite intent on finding the man who nearly murdered her. Kirby Mazrachi has enough problems without this guy, but somehow she manages to get through high school, enroll in college, and intern at the Chicago-Sun Times newspaper. She requests to assist former homicide writer Dan Velasquez, who also just happens to have covered her story. What lies ahead for all involved will be something that nobody could see coming. 

Lauren Beukes takes her readers to a very deep, dark place in the mind of a serial killer. The Shining Girls: A Novel is nowhere near okay for the faint of heart. It is gruesome, graphic, horrific, and gut wrenching. It is a thriller..the kind that causes you to forever lock the door behind you and close the blinds at dusk. If this is what you are into, you will not be disappointed!"
The Zookeeper's Wife,0393061728,Diane Ackerman,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,"It's a shame that this book misses the mark. The story of Jan and Antonnia deserves to be told by someone who can do it justice. The author can't even decide the narrative point of view, she never commits to it as either a novel or a documentary account, switching view points and adding obscure parenthetical references that are odd distractions. The run-on sentences are very hard to follow. Time and location shifts are vague and confusing too. I heard about this book through an interview with the author on Public Radio, but the interview was 10,000 times more entertaining than the book itself."
The Zookeeper's Wife,0393061728,Diane Ackerman,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,"I wholly endorse the five star reviews already printed here.  I find the most memorable aspects of the book are the instances in which Antonina was able to reach the goodness within apparently evil people through her calm communications.  Although the descriptions at the beginning seemed lengthy, the book was hard to put down as it drew to the climax of the Polish uprising."
The Zookeeper's Wife,0393061728,Diane Ackerman,Barnes and Noble,3.7,FayeT,"I absolutely love reading anything set in this time period and love that the story is fact based. The book serves as a good reminder of the heroics that took place under extrordinary circumstances. The problem was the writing. The author can describe things beautifully as long as it is pleasent. I thought there were times when the UNpleasent details needed to be fleshed out further. Also, at times the story would FINALLY be moving along nicely and the author would go off on a tanget about some inconsequential detail that added nothing to the story and quite frankly she just got annoying. I would reccomend googling the family from the story to learn about them because the family's actions really were incredible but i would pass on the book. There are plenty of other WONDERFUL war-time stories out there.  Cheers!"
Slade House,0812998685,David Mitchell,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,Loved this book and the writing technique of multiple stories winding together. I find all his box fantastic and sit and read for hours.
Slade House,0812998685,David Mitchell,Barnes and Noble,4.2,cloggiedownunder,"Slade House is the seventh novel by British author, David Mitchell. Slade House is a haunted house with a difference. It is not easily found, nor can just anyone get in. But once every nine years, at the end of Otober, a guest enters from Slade Alley through a mysteriously transient black iron door, and a good time is had by all, for a while, at least. And then….

Mitchell divides his tale into five chapters. Each is set nine years apart, and events are narrated by the guest (except for the last chapter). These events follow a pattern, and there are many common elements, but the differences are significant and important. And while it is quite apparent what will happen by the second chapter, the finer details and nuances are expanded in each chapter. 

This novel has an interesting and clever plot with a few twists. The characters are believable and their dialogue natural. Mitchell establishes the era easily with seamless references to politics, popular music and film, literature and current affairs. The genre is described as horror, although it is not of the blood-thirsty variety. It can easily be read as a stand-alone, but does have characters and features in common with other Mitchell novels, in particular The Bone Clocks, so fans of Mitchell’s work will enjoy placing these in their original context. Shorter than his usual, this is, nonetheless, another excellent offering from this talented author."
Slade House,0812998685,David Mitchell,Barnes and Noble,4.2,sandrabrazier,"If you aren’t vigilant, you might miss it…the tiny door in the brick-lined Slade Alley. The door leads to the Slade House, a home that is completely hidden from the outside world. Its lovely gardens and the huge, magnificent mansion are inexplicably hidden here, off narrow Slade Alley. Sometimes people who were last seen going into this alley, are never seen again.

This horror story sure doles out what it promises to deliver! Written in a very realistic manner, things start to take on a supernatural tinge once we enter Slade House. The realistic characters deliver this storyline effectively, eerily, creepily!

Beware. You might not want to enter Slade House, even as a reader. You might be sorry. It could haunt you forever!"
An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth,0316253014,Chris Hadfield,Barnes and Noble,4.3,CozyLittleBookJournal,"I have so many good things to say about this book I don't think they'll all fit into one review (for my full review, including my four-year-old's reaction to it, please visit my blog, Cozy Little Book Journal). Here's some of what I thought about the book:

Chris Hadfield knew he wanted to be an astronaut when he was nine years old. In fact, he remembers the exact moment he knew. It was late in the evening on July 20, 1969. That's when his entire family, spending the summer in Stag Island, Ontario, &quot;traipsed across the clearing&quot; to their neighbour's cottage so they could crowd themselves in front of the television and watch the moon landing. &quot;Somehow,&quot; he writes, &quot;we felt as if we were up there with Neil Armstrong, changing the world.&quot;

Hadfield writes about this early experience--and many, many of the other experiences that have led him to become the world's most recognized astronaut since Armstrong himself--in his new book, An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth.

I would have read this book a lot faster if I hadn't kept stopping every few pages to run out to tell my family what I'd just read. Magda didn't mind. She asked me to read aloud to her from the book every chance I got. At 4, I'd venture to say she knows more about space than most Canadians ten times her age, and we have Colonel Chris Hadfield to thank for that.

His videos from space captured her imagination and mine. Thanks to him, both my daughter and I have new heroes from all over the world.

And that's a gift that Chris Hadfield has given to so many of us; he's renewed our sense of wonder. He's inspired us to look at space again in a way most of us hadn't in a long time. He's inspired us to be passionately curious and unabashedly compassionate. He's shown us--through his eyes--what exactly it looks like to all be connected in this world (and off it). He's reminded us what it looks like to be passionate, competent and sincere, without irony or cynicism.

An Astronaut's Guide to Life really is a guide to life. Actually, it makes a pretty good guide to parenting too. Colonel Hadfield offers an insider's look into the life of an astronaut and the steps it takes to become one. It's deeply satisfying for those curious about the past, present and future of the space program, but it's also full of truly excellent advice for those with ambition in any field.

He writes: &quot;I never thought, 'If I don't make it as an astronaut, I'm a failure.' The script would have changed a lot if, instead, I'd moved up in the military or become a university professor or a commercial test pilot, but the result wouldn't have been a horror movie.&quot;

I love that. I love the attitude that you don't have to &quot;wait for your life to begin,&quot; as so many of us do (I know I have). You can start becoming the person you want to be right away, with the choices you make and the steps you take. And, most importantly, do the things that will make you happy along the way, whether or not you reach your end goal. And in fact the &quot;end goal&quot; may change many times but at least you'll be doing things you love.

I could say so much more about this book. What I can say is that I was even more inspired by the book than I already was by Colonel Hadfield himself, which is pretty darn inspired."
An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth,0316253014,Chris Hadfield,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"Have you ever wanted to know the life of an astronaut? How do you even get to be one? What do they do, especially when on earth? Why do they even do it? And how do you combine that with having a family? This wonderful new book will tell you all about it. 

Hadfield is truly excited about space exploration, and his enthusiasm is contagious. He gives the reader a window into his heart and motivations, alongside the factual account of his journey to becoming an astronaut, which turns out to be a life-long process - training never really stops. He explains how the space program works, all kinds of considerations that go into every single thing, the various difficulties and dangers.
Despite the seemingly technical subject, the prose is fluid and personal, and I really felt like I Hadfield is speaking to me, and I feel I know him a little bit, both as an astronaut, and as a person.
I heartily recommend this to anyone who was ever interested in space, as well as to everyone else - you'll be interested after this one."

An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth: What Going to Space Taught Me About Ingenuity, Determination, and Being Prepared for Anything, by Chris Hadfield, was an extremely detailed look at life on Earth and beyond. Through his description of the process of selecting a career, education, being selected, and going through the training of an astronaut, Hadfield paints a very vivid picture of a life characterized by vision, determination, and above all cooperation and service to others. Astronauts may be called upon to do anything on board, and once he had to fix a toilet and monitor two other men spacewalking, simultaneously. Training is very long, detailed, specific, and arduous as they have to simulate any possible thing that they may encounter and how they would resolve it.

Chris Hadfield describes his excitement during space launch, the view from the spacecraft, the interaction between astronauts of various countries and cultures, and the effects on a family on Earth and how they are a crucial part of his support system. I learned so much, more than I wanted to about peeing in space (astronauts even wear diapers if there is any chance they will be delayed in a no-bathroom situation), but also that weightless sleep is more comfortable than any bed on earth. Also, sinuses don&rsquo;t drain and the natural lubrication of your eyes does not flow as it does in gravity situations. Muscle tone decreases rapidly while in zero gravity, so special modified exercise equipment is necessary to avoid atrophy. This is a great narrative on focusing on and achieving your dreams, and the pluses and minuses that may go along with that. This audio book is 7 CDs plus a .pdf CD of supplementary material. Highly recommended for all ages."
"Ink Exchange (Wicked Lovely, #2)",006121468X,Melissa Marr,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"I really did enjoy Ink Spell, don't get me wrong. I love the writing, I love the darkness of Melissa Marr's writing. But I didn't find this book to be quite on the scale of Wicked Lovely, I felt like the writing seemed forced and didn't flow as easily as it did in the first book. I enjoyed Leslie's character but felt that maybe she was a little TOO dark. I guess it made sense with the plot, but I thought that she needed more substance than that.I missed Asylinn and Keenan's characters, they were barely mentioned and given the circumstances I thought that they should have held a larger role in the plot.Still, a very good book. Great book...not so much. But that's just my opinion. If you like Melissaq Marr, this one will be great for you too."
"Ink Exchange (Wicked Lovely, #2)",006121468X,Melissa Marr,Barnes and Noble,4.1,TeensReadToo,"Torn up inside after her drug-dealer brother betrays her in the most horrible way, Leslie puts on a brave front with her friends, pretending her drunken dad isn't letting the bills pile up and hiding all her pain. Hoping to take back control over her body, she decides to get a tattoo, and picks out a special design at the tattoo parlor she often hangs out at. Unbeknownst to Leslie, that tattoo is the symbol of Irial, the king of the faerie Dark Court, designed to allow him to filter the unpleasant emotions that feed his court through her into him and his people. As Leslie finds her vision changing and her feelings shifting in unpredictable ways, Niall, a faerie of the Summer Court who has always admired her, steps in, hoping to help her and keep Irial away. He has his own tangled feelings about Irial, whom he once counted as a friend. But as Leslie sinks further under Irial's thrall, enjoying the escape from the hurt and fear she'd been living with, only she can decide when to pull away--or whether she would rather stay with him, after all. INK EXCHANGE is a darkly imaginative novel set in the same world as Marr's first novel, WICKED LOVELY. Readers will enjoy exploring the lives of some of that novel's minor characters and seeing more of the shadowy side of the faerie courts. They may find Leslie, Niall, and Irial less engaging than the spirited and perhaps more sympathetic narrators of WICKED LOVELY, but the trio still make for a fascinating ""love"" triangle as each deals with conflicting emotions and tries to decide what is right both for him or herself and for those who are counting on them. The imagery is striking and evocative, and the politics of the different faerie courts is intriguing to explore. A great book for dark fantasy fans."
"Ink Exchange (Wicked Lovely, #2)",006121468X,Melissa Marr,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Tidbitsofscott,"INK EXCHANGE is the second book in Melissa Marr's Wicked Lovely Series. Where the first book dealt with the Summer and Winter Faerie Courts, this one opens readers to the Dark Court and its faeries.
Peace between Summer and Winter Court has weakening the Dark Court for they feed on the negative emotions. Peace doesn't exactly bring on those emotions. Irial, King of the Dark Court, works with Rabbit, a tattoo artist to find the right human to strengthen them - a human who will filter the emotions to Irial so that he can feed his court.
When Leslie, Aislinn's friend, makes up her mind to get a tattoo as a way to reclaim her body from the abuse she has been subjected to, it's one of Irial's enchanted design she elects to have. Little does she know this symbol will bind her to Irial and a fate will be far worse than before.
Leslie ends up caught in the dark world of faeries and sandwiched between a rogue who wants to save her and one who wants to possess her. The bittersweet ending stays true to the dark theme Marr has portrayed in this emotionally addictive story. I recommend it highly."

Normally reading 176 pages would take me about 2 days maximum. I don't know why but I just couldn't get into Bleachers. I like football but the story didn't really seem to have a plot it was just the story of a guy who used to play football and is now coming back to town because his coach is in the process of dying. I guess it shows how strong, but hidden are the friendships of the team. How they all went their separate ways after high school but when are called back to the town they can just sit and reminisce about the ""good ole' days"" when they were on the best team in Spartan history."

This is actually the first of the series I read even though it's the third book in the series. It starts off with Alex Rider an average 14 year old boy except he's saved the world 2 times before the age of 16, pretty amazing!!! At a school soccer game he is greeted by an old frenemy who is from M16 britains spy agency. Alex learns that he is being invited to the Wimbledon Tennis Tournament. I'll leave it at that because I can see you're already interested!!!"
"Skeleton Key (Alex Rider, #3)",0142406147,Anthony Horowitz,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,Anthony Horowitz is by far one of my favorite authors.  He writes so that you visualize every aspect of his writing.  The Skeleton Key is one in a series that has me hooked.  I think guys would like this series better than girls just because the hero is a boy and there is a lot of fighting and shooting.  I know a couple of my friends at school who are reading this series right now and they like it too.  This book is possessed and won't let you put it down until you have finished the last word.  The humor is great in these books and the endings are too.  The middle of the book is the best.  Anthony has a talent.  Read the books.
"Skeleton Key (Alex Rider, #3)",0142406147,Anthony Horowitz,Barnes and Noble,4.5,whyhellothere,"For English class, this book was my choice for a novel project. It was terrific! It fast-paced and it took many different turns. When it seems everything is figured out, for the better or the worse, something changes. Skeleton Key keeps your attention to the last second. Being the third book it the series, I thought it wasn't going to be as good as the other two books.Boy was I surprised when it was! ""Skeleton Key"" starts off with the bad-guys. The villain, General Alexei Sarov, bought one kilogram of weapons grade Uranium. Then, it goes back to Alex rider, a 14 year old spy. One of the workers for the spy headquarters, M16, asks him to go to Wimbledon. Alex accepts the offer, but once he is there he finds out there a bag people, part of a Chinese gang, who were sabotaging the other players. Alex found this out, but then the gang was after him, so he had to leave the country. M16 sent him on a mission, to accompany two CIA agents, so that they could destroy General Sarov's uranium. Will they succeed? At every point in this book, I couldn't help but wonder what was going to happen next. When you hear the words ""spy book"" you think of something gory and gross. That is not what Skeleton Key is like at all. It is for anyone who likes fast paced books!"

Is this the kind of book you will be thinking about for days after you finish it? No. But it sure is a heck of a fun read. Coben is excellent at keeping the action going while still holding back enough to give the reader a real sense of suspense. My only complaint really is what an irritating wuss the main character could be at times, but it didn't really hinder my enjoyment of the book as a whole. One thing is for sure, there were certainly more twists in this book than a slinky. If you are looking for an easy, enjoyable ""average joe"" mystery, then Gone For Good is not a bad choice."

This book starts of the Liveship Traders trilogy in a much more positive and fantastic way then Hobbs other works.

I often find myself not really liking the main characters in novels, but I truly like Harry; he is a good guy - not perfect, but he works hard, isn't a womanizer, and isn't overly macho.  All of the stories are well-written, realistic, contain surprises and twists, and keep me hooked until the very end.  My favorites have been The Black Echo (#1), The Concrete Blonde (#3), Trunk Music (#5), City of Bones (#8), The Narrows (#10), although again - I enjoyed all of them.  If you like detective mystery novels, you won't be disappointed with Michael Connelly and Harry Bosch."

No Spoilers whatsoever in this review.

Why is it harder to write a review for a book that I really loved than one I just liked? I was so excited about this book it was hard to write in complete sentences. Hehe!

I am very conservative with my 10 star ratings, only books that are my absolute favorite that I know I will read again and again get a perfect score. The Iron Trial gets 10 Stars!

Many of the reviews on Goodreads compared this book to Harry Potter. I think fans of Harry Potter will like this book, but this is NOT a Harry Potter copy! The plot, the characters, and the magic are all unique and different.

My short summary: (This only the setup for the beginning of the book.)

Twelve year-old Callum Hunt, called Call, is always getting in trouble at school and being bullied over his bad leg. Call knows about magic, but his father hasn&rsquo;t used it since Call&rsquo;s mother died when he was a baby. It&rsquo;s now time for Call&rsquo;s Iron Trial to see if he&rsquo;s to be trained in magic, but Call&rsquo;s father has told him that the Magisterium is evil and he has to fail his trial.

My Review:

Call&rsquo;s not your perfect protagonist. He has an abrasive personality, always saying the wrong things. He complains that he doesn&rsquo;t have friends, but when people try to befriend him, he&rsquo;s mean to them. I think because he&rsquo;s never had friends he has trouble trusting people. It takes a little while to warm up to Call, but I liked that he wasn&rsquo;t the usual narrator.

Aaron is your typical orphan protagonist. Call calls him Captain America, good looks, nice, talented, and makes friends easily. There are numerous other minor characters and if I had a complaint about this book it was that there were so many minor characters that they were hard to keep straight.

Though I got to read the The Iron Trials early I already pre-ordered it. Yes it&rsquo;s that good!

Sorry I didn&rsquo;t say much about the actual book, I wanted to be careful not to give anything away. Just read it!

I only wish it was longer!! I want more!!

The Iron Trial: 10 Stars!

Point of View: Third (Call)"
"The Iron Trial (Magisterium, #1)",0545522250,"Holly Black, Cassandra Clare",Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,So first off I am not the target age range for this book but with that being said I very much enjoyed this book. It wad a great story line drew me in at the very start. Going to have my boys read this next.
"The Iron Trial (Magisterium, #1)",0545522250,"Holly Black, Cassandra Clare",Barnes and Noble,4.6,Splashesintobooks1,"Wow - a brilliant new magical series is born! The book is skilfully written, with characters you can easily relate to and settings so brilliantly depicted you feel you could be there, watching the events unfold. Don't be fooled into thinking this is going to be just another version of J.K. Rowling's 'Harry Potter' series . . . there are similarities in that the main character, Call, doesn't fit in to his school and is picked on by others and he is magically talented but that's where the stories part company.




Call doesn't want to go to magical school - the Magisterium - because his father has always warned him about how bad it is and how it killed his mother. The Magisterium is an underground school in every sense of the term - it is in a cave system, with no windows and lots of hidden pathways and caverns.  Call has to be tested because his parents were both magically talented. He is determined to fail the tests and really tries to do so. Fairly obviously, he doesn't succeed in that and that's as much as I'll share here because you really do need to read this to find out what happens next - and keep reading to the end because there's a dramatic twist in this tale that will leave you reeling. I can't wait to read the next book in this series, I really want to know what happens next!




This is probably aimed at teenagers but it can certainly be enjoyed by adults, too. I hope someone in the film industry also reads it as it could so easily be another brilliant block buster film series if it carries on in the same manner.




Thank you, so much, to the authors, publisher and NetGalley for letting me read this brilliant book. I'll volunteer to read any other books in this series as soon as they are published in exchange for reviewing them honestly, as I've done here!"

"The Carrie Diaries (The Carrie Diaries, #1)",0061728918,Candace Bushnell,Barnes and Noble,3.8,-kay-,"It's time to meet Carrie. Before there was Carrie Bradshaw with Sex and the City, there was only Carrie, nicknamed Bradley by her friends, from Castlebury, Connecticut. The Carrie Diaries, a prequel to Candace Bushnell's book Sex and the City, and to which the TV series is based on, introduces Carrie and shows how she was sculpted into the woman she became.          

     The first Sex and the City book was published in 1997 and was scripted into a HBO TV series of the same name in 1998 and lasting through 2004.  Sarah Jessica Parker starred as Carrie in the series and reprised her role in the movies as well. 
            
     The book tracks Carrie's senior year in high school, along with details about her family life, her friends, and her experiences with the good, sweet guys, and bad, toxic guys. Fans of Sex and the City will be familiar with the Carrie they have come to know. Her fashion statements began at a young age while wearing red Mary Jane shoes to kindergarten, and only have progressed even more entering a life of adulthood with her thrifty white go-go boots, and her sassy, yet youthful attitude has not changed a bit.
           
     Aimed mostly at teens, and true Sex and the City fans, the whirlwind of high school and all its drama is presented in a way that everyone can relate to. Breakups and makeups, secrets hidden by friends, family trouble, and always that one popular girl who makes your life hell, is what Carrie, her friends and family go through in one single year.
 
     Though all the drama, which makes you actually think you are reliving your high school year, Carrie knows what she wants to be in life and goes after it. Amid her and her friends smoking behind the school, or taking shots down at the local bar, she does everything in her power to get it, but the question is if it all pays off or not. 
      
     With an ending that will keep you captivated waiting for the second installment of this book set to come out next summer, this book shapes a popular character and a better understanding on her adolescent lifestyle. Fans alike will never want to put this book down."

"The Carrie Diaries (The Carrie Diaries, #1)",0061728918,Candace Bushnell,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Dolly80,"I find it strange that anyone would comment negatively about an author's character.  Carrie from The Carrie Diaries is one of the most kick-ass literary female characters I've read since The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.  She's quick as a whip, funny as hell and doesn't take any flack from anyone.  The way Candace has written the true Carrie makes me love the TV version of her even more.  Candace shows you what it took to get where Carrie is when we meet her in the show - finally someone spells it out that you don't just arrive in NYC and move into some fabulous apartment and start writing for Vogue. That's the dream and you have to work hard to get there and bring your experiences that shaped you with you -- that's what matters.  I love the new characters. And I love feeling like a teenager again through this book - all the wonder about what's going to happen next.  I can't wait to read the next one!!!"

Rayford and Buck begin to work for Nicolae and his regime (Nicolae creates ""Global Everything"") and quickly realize that their status as believers is best kept undercover so they can keep working with the other Trib Force members.

Food Rules: An Eater's Manual,014311638X,Michael Pollan,Barnes and Noble,3.9,NormaHartie,"I picked up Food Rules: An Eater's Manual, because I have been searching for just this type of book for many of my clients as a New Year's gift. I read the slim book quickly in a bookstore and it is the perfect present for my clients who are not eating healthy diets (but who have confessed they wish to.)

I am an interior designer/organizer and see how my clients eat all the time when I redesign and organize their kitchens. Pollan's In Defense of Food and The Omnivore's Dilemma are both excellent, but can be intimidating. Not Food Rules--it is short and easy to understand.

The book is divided into three parts and has 64 chapters or rules. The following will give you an good idea of what the book is about: Part I, What should I eat? Includes such chapters as ""Don't eat anything your great-grandmother wouldn't recognize as food"", ""avoid food products that contain more than five ingredients"", and ""avoid foods that contain high-fructose corn syrup"".

Part II, What kind of food should I eat? Includes ""Eat mostly plants, especially leaves"", ""eat your colors"", and ""the whiter the bread, the sooner you will be dead.""

Part III, How should I eat? Includes ""pay more, eat less,"" ""eat less,"" and ""limit your snacks to unprocessed plant food.""

For those of you who desire a healthier diet, Food Rules is a terrific guide that makes understanding what to put into your body simple to understand and implement.

Finally, if healthy eating is a new concept for you, you will find the clever chapter titles easy to memorize, thus making the concept of healthy eating a simple one to learn.

Highly recommend.

Those Who Leave and Those Who Stay (The Neapolitan Novels #3),1609452232,"Elena Ferrante, Ann Goldstein",Barnes and Noble,4.3,cloggiedownunder,"Those Who Leave and Those Who Stay is the third book in the Neapolitan Novels series by Italian author, Elena Ferrante. This installment takes up the story of Lila Cerullo and Elena Greco when they are in their mid-twenties (1969) and relates the events of their lives until they are in their early thirties (1976). Lila is living in San Giovanni a Teduccio with her young son, Gennaro, under the care of Enzo Scanno, and working at the sausage factory of Bruno Soccavo. Elena has just published her first novel, is about to marry Pietro Airota and move to Florence. Against the background of the political upheaval and violence in Italy during the seventies, Elena details significant incidents in her own life: the mixed reception to her novel, her marriage, children, her further attempts at writing, her encounters with her dear friend, Lila and with the man she has always loved, Nino Sarratore. Elena begins her narration by stating when she last saw Lila (2005) and that the purpose of her narration is to draw Lila (who has been missing since 2010) out to correct her story. The reason for this eventually becomes apparent. Elena relates what she knows of Lila&rsquo;s life from what she has been told by Lila herself, and what she has heard from others. Ferrante skilfully evokes the feel of Italy and the &ldquo;neighbourhood&rdquo; in Naples at this turbulent time, and it is a story with virtually no joy, but plenty of honesty and grit. It is, at times, confronting and never pleasant. Ferrante&rsquo;s characters are complex and well-formed and, while the reader may be able to identify with some, they are, without exception, unappealing. Elena&rsquo;s final actions, uncharacteristic as they are, make for a cliff-hanger ending. The first-person narration by Elena gives this series a decidedly autobiographic feel, which is echoed in the subject of her narrator&rsquo;s own novel. Not only readers new to this series will appreciate the seven-page Index of Characters and Notes on the Events of Earlier Volumes (even if only to distinguish Dino from Gino, Rino, and Nino). Readers will find themselves constantly flicking back to these seven pages to establish the relationships, political affiliations and loyalties of the many characters. This powerful novel is flawlessly translated by Ann Goldstein. Readers who enjoyed the first two books of the series will not be disappointed, and will look forward to the final book of the series. A compelling read."

I feel as if I know everyone in these stories, as if I see them every day, as if I grew up and lived with all of them. I rarely reread books, but I plan to reread all three novels prior to the release of the fourth one. The writing is so vivid, it's like watching a favorite film series over and over."
Those Who Leave and Those Who Stay (The Neapolitan Novels #3),1609452232,"Elena Ferrante, Ann Goldstein",Barnes and Noble,4.3,carlosmock,"Those Who leave and Those who Stay by Elena Ferrante (pseudonym).  Translated from Italian to English by Ann Goldstein

This is the third installment of Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan Novels.  The book opens when our protagonists, Rafaella Cerullo (Lila or Lina) and Elena Greco (Lenu) are in their thirties.  Elena is marrying Pietro Airota, a professor in Florence.  Elena physically escapes her home in Naples to become and also get married to an intellectual in Florence. Lila remains in Naples, hence the title of the book. 

Lina has separated from her husband Stefano.  Lila has a son, Gennaro - we don't know who the father is.  Elena has two daughters, Dede and Elsa.  Both women are unhappy and the book ends when Elena decides to leave her husband, Pietro for her childhood crush, Nino Sarratore, a womanizer and intellectual man who is supposed to be the father of Lila's son.

The book is narrated from a universal first person point of view, and there lies the problem.  The pronouns are confusing  - most of the time you have no idea as to who ""he, or she"" refers to, and it's very impersonal.  it would have been a much better way of narrating the story if Ms. Ferraro would have chosen the third person point if view - especially since she is trying to convey other people's feelings. I found this third book more difficult to follow. While the writing is still phenomenal in its minute psychological detail and insights into class and gender and how ideology gets used as a currency in social games, it is difficult and not always pleasant reading.  I found myself skimming long paragraphs that were supposedly someone's feelings, but were told from someone else's point of view.  The narrative becomes more intense and her personality less pleasant.  The Italian conflict between the right (fascists) and the left (communists) is more pronounced as the protagonist's friends chose one side or the other.  However, until the author embraces the third person point of view,  her work is at most average."
Then We Came to the End,0316016381,Joshua Ferris,Barnes and Noble,3.5,LonestarRx,"This book won all kinds of awards, and deservedly so. You'll want to give it to everyone you know who works in an office. Daring to write in the second person (we), Ferris paints a nuanced portrait of a large cast of characters working in an ad agency at the moment the layoffs begin. The novel begins like this: ""We were fractious and overpaid. Our mornings lacked promise. At least those of us who smoked had something to look forward to at ten-fifteen. Most of us liked most everyone, a few of us hated specific individuals. ... "" Either he's got you from the get-go, or this isn't the novel for you. Over the course of the book, we meet a range of characters with very real problems (one has breast cancer; one has a big inferiority complex; one has lost her daughter; etc.) and the mood deepens; but nearly all of the action of the book is filtered through the unwavering voice of the ""we,"" that bizarre nameless mob made real by pitch-perfect details, and made bearable by Ferris's wonderful dry wit. I can't wait for his next book."

Then We Came to the End,0316016381,Joshua Ferris,Barnes and Noble,3.5,DesignerReader,"Ferris writes in such a way that he combines anonymity with an intimate view of each character. In a way, this truly reflects the feeling of an office environment. No one knows anyone, yet everyone knows everything.  A fresh voice, but it is a little surface-level. Hopefully there is another, meatier novel soon to be born from Joshua Ferris's mind."
"Ship of Destiny (Liveship Traders, #3)",0553575651,Robin Hobb,Barnes and Noble,4.5,GLTurner1,"Excellent series.   Loved every book in the series, and the characters of Captain Kennit and Paragon, as well as their relationship to eachother, are very , very deep and profound.  WOW."
"Ship of Destiny (Liveship Traders, #3)",0553575651,Robin Hobb,Barnes and Noble,4.5,JahaRa,"I loved the whole Farseer, LiveShiop saga and think Robin Hobb is one of the better fantasy writers of the ages.  Her characters are well developed, she can write well in both 1st person and 3rd, and the story is wonderful.  This was a great end of a middle of a great series."
"Ship of Destiny (Liveship Traders, #3)",0553575651,Robin Hobb,Barnes and Noble,4.5,liveshipvivacia,"The good: I quite enjoyed seeing references to Fitz and the changes wrought in Paragon. The dragons taking precedence was stunning, but not unwarranted. I also appreciated the romantic entanglements and the ability to hate a character for about thirty pages and then sob hysterically over his death. The characterization is, as always, superb.

The bad: That being said, perhaps because I read the three books together, with only one book in between the second and third, it was far too long. The pacing, in certain parts of the book, was atrocious. I had to set myself a goal in terms of reading just so I could get through the book in a reasonable time. Don't get me wrong- I wanted to know what happened, but the pacing was so slow, I had to force myself through.

I've heard the Liveship Traders are not as good as the Assassins' series (nor the Tawny Man trilogy). I look forward to seeing if that's the case, but for now, I'm taking a break from Robin Hobb. I need to read a book that takes less than the sum total of 2100 pages (if we consider the trilogy actually one book) to reach its conclusion. 

The Nook edition contained a couple of typing errors (one capitalization problem and one spacing), though nothing terribly distracting."
"Hana-Kimi, Vol. 1 (Hana-Kimi, #1)",1591163293,"Hisaya Nakajo, David Ury",Barnes and Noble,4.5,rationalizedmadness,"The notion of crossdressing in manga is not a new one. The notion of using crossdressing in manga as a long-term device to acquire love is also not a new one. Therefore, I was not particularly shocked or intrigued by Mizuki's endeavors...especially when it takes the main couple 2 volumes to figure out that they're in love and *23* to actually say it. I would have put this manga back on the shelf long before I finished it, however...

All of the side characters in Hana-Kimi convinced me to not give up on the story until I had finished it. Despite the fact that you were supposed to be focusing on Mizuko/Sano/Nakatsu, I couldn't help but feel like each of the side characters had a more interesting personality or storyline than the main love triangle. (I'll admit that Nakatsu has his lovable quirks, but the naive, Mary-Sue type heroine, the silent, overly-protective love interest, and the goofball friend can only get you so far.)


Whether it was Oscar, the germanophile with a supremacy complex and his rivalry with the equally egocentric Hibari, the eccentric karate club and the questionable relationship between Kujou and Kadoma, or the mildly sarcastic psychic who can see auras and ghosts, everyone seems to outshine the the main group of lovers. Even at the end, I found myself saying ""Oh no, what will happen to Kadoma once Kujou graduates?"" rather than *SPOILER*  ""Oh no, Mizuki was found out!""  *END SPOILER* Their situation and personalities were just too unbelievable and cliche to focus on, so I didn't feel a strong connection to them.

Art-wise, Hana-Kimi starts out a bit weak, but eventually grows to a more advanced style as the series progresses. Towards the last 3 or so volumes, the art quality does seem to take a bit of a nosedive, however. It maintains a very general 90's shoujo manga style, and doesn't take any risks or develop an extremely defining style.

Overall, Hana-Kimi is good for those who are interested by the average shoujo series, or for those who are content with being amused by the minor characters, but it isn't a very stimulating series, and you can easily skip 5 volumes and still see Mizuki and Sano doing exactly what they've always been doing. How much you enjoy this series mainly depends on what types of characters you are drawn to, and for how long you are interested in them."
"Hana-Kimi, Vol. 1 (Hana-Kimi, #1)",1591163293,"Hisaya Nakajo, David Ury",Barnes and Noble,4.5,nmhale on LibraryThing,"This is one of my favorite manga series. I'm a bit of a sucker for the cross-dressing motif that appears again and again in this format. (As well as in television and movies, Japanese and American, dating from way back when - Twelfth Night, anyone?) In this series, Mizuki wants to go to school with her idol, Sano, who is a high jump athlete. Unfortunately, he attends an all-boy school. What's a girl to do? Cut her hair, don a halter to hide her bust, and enroll, of course! We meet all the main characters in this initial volume, and also see that Sano learns Mizuki's secret right away, but decides to keep mum. The romance abounds, but not as much as the humor and school shojo themes. A happy and uplifting story about truly good people, it made me miss my college days (which seemed more akin to their high school experiences)."

"Daughter of the Forest  (Sevenwaters, #1)",0765343436,Juliet Marillier,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Leaht52086,"This book and it's sequels were first recommended to me by a girl I went to school with. We were on a school sanctioned field trip to Belize at the time. I bought the book soon after we returned home, but as close minded as this sounds, because it came from the fantasy section, I had many reservations about whether or not I'd be into the book or not. Plus, the girl who recommended them was very nice, but at the same time a bit eccentric and over all into completely different things than me. So the book sat on my shelf for a good 7 years, until one day this past year I entered my old room at my parents house, wiped away all the dust and took it home. To make an already long story short, I read it and fell in love. Yes it was a bit different than the books I usually read with fair folk and a soceress, but it contained the one thing that's always sure to please me, a realistic and beautiful love story! If you like books that have a love story, but just as importantly have a well written, unique and interesting story line to go with it, this book and it's sequels are for you!"
"Daughter of the Forest  (Sevenwaters, #1)",0765343436,Juliet Marillier,Barnes and Noble,4.7,katford11,"I was a sophomore in high school the first time I read this book.  That was 2002, and I have probably read this book once a year since then.  At the time I read this book, it really impacted me, and i could not put it down. Still, even now, every time I re-read this book, I know that I will read the story with the fervor I read it with that very first time.  

The story is based off an old fairy tale, and I even remember a cartoon from several years ago that was a different interpretation of the same story, but for those who love re-imagined fairy-tales, celtic adventure, and have a penchant for the genres that re-visit the past, then this is the book for you.

The content of the story is mature, and it is a little slow to start, but once the book picks up, it flies.  As a military family, we moved a lot.  The first time I read the book, it was a copy from my school library.  The second time, I bought the book.  The book was lost in a move.  I bought it again.  During our next move it was misplaced in a box that I still have not found.  Long story short, I am sure that I have purchased this book at least 5 times for myself, and at least twice as a gift for a friend.  After yet another move and search this summer, I gave in and purchased the eBook.  Hopefully I cannot lose this version.  I highly recommend the story, and hope that you love the book as much as I did."
"Daughter of the Forest  (Sevenwaters, #1)",0765343436,Juliet Marillier,Barnes and Noble,4.7,AmPHiTrtE91,"This is the first book that I've read by this author and I am completely hooked. The story is based on a fairy tale and the author takes it to a whole new level of story telling and writing. I enjoyed every page. There are books that you read and while you're reading them, you imagine that you are one of the characters and are going through every action and emotion that they are. While I enjoyed going through Sorcha's journey with her, it was difficult to imagine myself in her position. Not because it seems unlikely, but quite the opposite. She seems like such a strong person and were I in her shoes, I don't know if I would've been able to withstand everything that she has been through.

The Very Busy Spider,0399229191,Eric Carle,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,Eric Carle is a very popular children's author in our classroom. His illustrations are vibrant and this story has a repetitive refrain that makes it ideal for child participation.
The Very Busy Spider,0399229191,Eric Carle,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,My 1 year old likes the animals sounds.  He says 'Moo Moo' and 'Baa Baa' as soon as he sees the pictures.  After a few months of reading this to him he's finally interested in the spider and feeling the web.
Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?,1591843162,Seth Godin,Barnes and Noble,4,jmunz,"This is the basic premise of the new book by Seth Godin - ""Linchpin - Are You Indispensable?""  I have to admit that this book took longer to read for me than what I thought it would.  It is not an overly complex book in layout or form but for me it struck close to home on many topics that I have had to work through over the past several years. So I found myself reviewing sections and comparing with past experiences.

Mr. Godin describes what it takes to become a linchpin in your current job or if that just isn't possible how to make changes in your life so you can become one. A linchpin is an individual who can walk into chaos and create order, someone who can invent, connect, create and make things happen.   He describes that the constant resistance to achieving this status in your company or in your life is our biological desire to survive which prevents us from taking risks. The current machine also inhibits this by educating you to follow processes and procedures that are meant to make you a replaceable cog in the industrial framework that we live in today.

So are you indispensable? If you believe you are, make certain you fit the model described in this book. If you have never thought about it before, are struggling with the changes that are taking place in the work place, or feel you have lost control of your career then stop everything and read this book. 

What Mr. Godin provides is a clear description of where the world has ventured and for anyone who wishes to participate he gives them the new rules of engagement."
Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?,1591843162,Seth Godin,Barnes and Noble,4,alphaneer,"I read LINCHPIN and couldn't put it down and read it again months later armed with a highlighter.

One of the key themes resonating the pages is the continuum of where average comes from, the attitudes of success, and the NOW moment for reclaiming the indispensability that has been thrown to the wayside in exchange for cogs, for parts, for industrialization and dehumanization.

The Quadrants of Discernment that Seth maps out are one of those short pause and study moments.  It's a tempting place to think of where people in your life fit in here, but if you take an honest inventory of yourself, you may find that fundamentalist zealot, whiner, bureaucrat, and linchpin tendencies come to mind.  The idea here is that the linchpin really stands to be mutually exclusive and carries the traits of passion and discernment and dumps the rest.  

The &quot;When It Doesn't Work&quot; section gives the reader valuable ways to think through this problem.  &quot;My Boss Won't Let Me&quot; is, perhaps, placed into the bread slicer and most of that loaf gets toasted.  Do art and don't get caught up in monetization.  The contrast of the influence Renzo the architect has in doing his craft and real tactics you can use when you're not a big name.  

Study the venn of indispensability and the venn of surrender-- it could be a fork in the road calling you to travel the straits of surrender with the same old scenery or travel the terrain of indispensability with the artists' cycle of continuous giving and not being a cog.  

One could use words like common knowledge or cheerleader manual to describe the book and so choose to occupy the quadrants of fundamentalist zealot and whiner.  They travel the straights of surrender with a small canvas and two colors of paint, black and white.  Where there is a group of them, there you will find the bureaucrat, keeping the passivity in order.  

Make and Give Art, Learn, Make More.  Give it to the above mentioned.  Try and fail because you have the right to."
Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?,1591843162,Seth Godin,Barnes and Noble,4,RolfDobelli,"Warning: If you absorb all business blogger Seth Godin's advice, you could end up overworked and underappreciated. Godin's antidote to mediocrity and conformity is so effective and convincing that it may have the unintended consequence of making you the go-to person for your whole organization. Godin stipulates that everyone faces a choice: An individual can choose to live day after day, year after year, languidly going through the motions, doing work that is devoid of excitement and imagination. Or, he or she can choose a path that promotes uniqueness and ingenuity by becoming a ""linchpin,"" an invaluable, indispensable employee, the center of all a company's activities. Godin declares that if you believe in yourself and your potential for greatness, kindle the creative spark within, embrace risk and seek the good in others, you can become an influential linchpin. Although Godin writes in his signature rambling style, which some readers may find distracting, getAbstract applauds this unique, absorbing business book, whose reach extends far beyond the conference room. The author has done his part; your path is up to you. Proceed with caution - even being a linchpin has its hazards.

The River of Doubt: Theodore Roosevelt's Darkest Journey,0767913736,Candice Millard,Barnes and Noble,4.1,BrianKGlass,"I've been a longtime admirer of Teddy Roosevelt so when this book was originally published I got it right away. I started reading it but something happened and for no particular reason I stopped after a few chapters. I found that I wasn't as enthusiastic about it as I thought I would be. So for several years it set on my book shelf and I promised I would go back and finish it someday. I'm glad I finally got around to reading it. This book has a lot of interesting information, everything from Roosevelt family history to politics of the era and the story of the Amazon all rolled into a pretty rousing adventure tale. If there is one failing of the book it is the lack of atmosphere. What I mean by this is that while the author writes of the dire circumstances of the expedition's plight the writing can be a little too sterile to convey that emotionally. It's one thing to be told of the crew's starvation but I didn't necessarily feel like I was there. It's hard to quantify and it is not a major problem, the writing is very well done.

I like the insight into Roosevelt's personality and ideals. If there is one thing the author conveyed in no uncertain terms it is the admiration and sense of awe that the former President instilled in those around him.

I love this time frame in US and world history and this jungle safari fantasy come to life. It was packed full of great information and little bits of detail that added quite a bit to the story. The historic photos also added a lot. For me it was a fast and enjoyable read."
The River of Doubt: Theodore Roosevelt's Darkest Journey,0767913736,Candice Millard,Barnes and Noble,4.1,davedDD,"River of Doubt is a great read.  It's a look into a day when men still did exceptional things, without thought of their safety.

Complications: A Surgeon's Notes on an Imperfect Science,0312421702,"Atul Gawande, Susanne Kuhlmann-Krieg",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"This is a great read from a very respected surgeon.  As a physician myself, I've always enjoyed reading books by physicians.  Dr. Gawande has emerged as quite possibly the most reasonable, insightful, and even poetic of all physician writers.  This book is a great read for anyone interested in the ethics of being a surgeon.  Dr. Gawande's other books are also interesting reads, especially for doctors.
Other books by surgeons I highly recommend are Dr. Anthony Youn's &quot;In Stitches,&quot; which is his absolutely hilarious and heartwarming story of becoming a doctor, and &quot;Hot Lights Cold Steel&quot; by orthopedic surgeon Dr. Michael Collins.  These are geared towards a general audience and very worthwhile reads."

"Side Jobs: Stories from the Dresden Files (The Dresden Files, #12.5)",045146365X,Jim Butcher,Barnes and Noble,4.5,amslogos,"The hardcover is on my desk next to me, and of course I have all Dresden titles for Nook, too, now. Each short story is headed by an annotation by Jim Butcher himself. Pretty cool.

A Restoration of Faith (pg 1) is a pre-Storm Front look at Harry meeting Murphy. Harry saves a run-away pre-teen girl from a Bridge Troll.

Vignette (pg 21) is a look at Harry working out a Yellowbook ad with Bob.

Something Borrowed (27) is a look at a Faerie revenge move on Billy and Georgia's wedding.

It's My Birthday, Too (61) is a fast-paced Black Court Vamp romp of wit, quick thinking, and Little Folk bargaining when Harry tries to celebrate Thomas' birthday. My favorite of the book!

Heorot (107) teams Dresden up with Gard. We learn her background, your jaw drops, a damsel is saved, and Mac thanks Harry.

Day Off (149) is my second favorite ""side job"". If artists were contracted to paint this story, they would need to hire the genetic love-child of Norman Rockwell, someone from The New Yorker magazine, and any conceptual artist Sam Rami used in the Spider-Man trilogy.

Backup (173) is a Thomas Raith POV. Worth the read. I bought this when it was released seperately, and was not disappointed. It deepens the scope of the non-human realm of the Dresdenverse.

The Warrior (211) shows how little choices have big ramifications. And it shows that Michael, though disabled, is still one kick-butt character.

Last Call (269) is a Harry/Murphy tag team that stops a maenad from turning a Bulls game into a drunken lovefest. Murphy nearly cleans Dresden's clock. Read it!

Love Hurts (303) is a fun read about a Red Court scientist ""spreading"" love through enchantment, and how Harry/Murphy tag that creature for Death's collection.

Aftermath (335) is a Murphy POV after Changes, when Dresden is missing/ presumed dead. Murphy and Billy go after Sea Mutants. Oh, yeah, and Marcone spares Billy's life so he can save others' lives. Look for that debt to be called upon later in the Dresden series.

I rated the Book Cover poorly, because Dresden does NOT wear a hat, but ROC's artist can't take it off, apparently....

I had a hard time rounding up these Side Job stories on my own. I ran across ""The Warrior"" after I read Turn Coat in that small anthology. I scoured the Internet for PDF scans of any other short Dresden story. Now I have them all! :)"
"Side Jobs: Stories from the Dresden Files (The Dresden Files, #12.5)",045146365X,Jim Butcher,Barnes and Noble,4.5,harstan,"Although the quality of the eleven entries varies to an incredible degree, fans of Dresden will want to read the anthology that is a sort of history of the author.  No question, the audience will want to read the novella ""Aftermath"", which occurs a few hours after the end of the stunning Changes.  Many of the tales fill the gaps between the novels especially with a close look at support cast in entries like ""Backup"" focuses on Thomas and ""Warrior"" on Michael.  Some like the first Dresden unpublished tale, A Restoration of Faith, displays Jim Butcher's talent, but not experience as the contribution is a bit confusing; that might be caused by knowing so much about the only wizard in the Chicago phone book.  Clearly this compilation is for fans of the series; newcomers would be better off watching the TV show or starting with the novels as that is Mr. Butcher's forte.

"Side Jobs: Stories from the Dresden Files (The Dresden Files, #12.5)",045146365X,Jim Butcher,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Shiroikami,"Side Jobs is both alike and completely different from all of the Dresden Files books up to this point. It's a collection of short stories, written by Jim Butcher, which take place at various points in the continuity of the Dresden Files universe, each one prefaced by a short explanation.

It's the same, most obviously because it involves the characters and locations that readers have come to know and love through the main series of novels, but also because of the writing itself, which pulls you in and never wants to let go. The difference comes through the feeling and the ideas behind each story. The ones written in the usual manner, from Harry's perspective, feel lighter and less serious, while the ones NOT written from his perspective (of which there are two - one from Thomas's viewpoint and the other from Murphy's) actually have a different texture, and really do feel like they are being narrated by someone else while still keeping with the usual Dresden Files tone.

In all, Side Jobs is definitely a book to pick up if you've read the other Dresden Files novels (if you haven't, some of the characters and events referenced in the short stories will be a bit confusing, although Jim Butcher does his best to explain them in the narratives)."
The Hundred Secret Senses,080411109X,Amy Tan,Barnes and Noble,4.3,MissPrint,"While Amy Tan is an amazingly talented writer with a lot of great books under her belt, she is arguably most well known as the author of The Joy Luck Club, which I have yet to read. I did, however, read The Hundred Secret Senses (originally published in 1996) not once but twice. I almost never do that because the second reading just feels boring. However, that wasn't the case with this book because it was so enjoyable and rich that rereading felt more like visiting old friends than rehashing something I already knew.

While on the subject of this novel's freshness, it bears mention that some reviewers suggested The Hundred Secret Senses was little more than a rehash of previous, very similar, plots from her earlier books. Obviously, I can't speak for The Joy Luck Club but I did read The Kitchen God's Wife which had a similar theme but in my view an entirely different plot. I also happened to think this novel was the markedly better of the two.

Olivia's mother is American, her father Chinese. She comes from a ""traditional American family."" At least for the most part.  At the age of eighteen, Kwan entered the lives of Olivia (then four) and her family from her native China. Nothing about Kwan is American from her accent to her belief that she has yin eyes to see ""those who have died and now dwell in the World of Yin, ghosts who leave the mists just to visit her kitchen on Balboa Street in San Francisco.""

These ghosts are not only a fundamental part of the story but one of the main reasons Olivia can never truly get along with her older sister.

For a while, it seems like Olivia will be able to ignore Kwan's eccentricities and lead her own, American, life. But the more Olivia hears, the more Kwan's old ghosts stories intrigue her. Their enticement grows when Olivia unexpectedly finds herself traveling to China with her husband, Simon, and Kwan for a magazine assignment. As the three navigate Kwan's childhood stomping grounds, surprising connections are made between the threesome and, amazingly, with one of Kwan's ghost stories.

The novel chronicles Olivia's relationship with Kwan as well as her early courtship and eventual estrangement from Simon. At the same time, in alternating chapters, The Hundred Secret Senses tells the story of one of Kwan's past lives in China during the 1800s--a dramatic love story closely tied to Kwan's (and Olivia's) present lives.

Tan's prose here is conversational and enticing, feeling like a friend telling a particularly juicy story at dinner or over the phone. The connections between past, present and the very distant past is seamless creating a tight narrative that, by the end of the book, weaves all aspects of the story together in a neat package.

At the same time, The Hundred Secret Senses offers an interesting commentary on assimilation and multi-cultuarism with both Olivia and Simon being half-white and half-Chinese. Although Olivia might be too old to say she comes of age in this novel, it would be fair to say she learns to accept her own identity by the novel's completion.

While all of that makes for a dynamo on its own, my favorite aspect of this book is the way in which it deals with family relations both romantically (with Olivia and Simon) and otherwise (with Olivia and Kwan). The story ends with an optimism that suggests, if you are willing to see them, loved ones are never very far away."
The Hundred Secret Senses,080411109X,Amy Tan,Barnes and Noble,4.3,steveiewoolf,"American Chinese Olivia Laguni finds out she has an older Chinese half sister, Kwan Li, after her father&rsquo;s death bed confession to her mother.  From initially being excited about the prospect of having a sister the six year olds excitement soon evaporates and turns into embarrassment and resentment of her mangled English speaking sister. This embarrassment is compounded by Kwan&rsquo;s belief that she can see and talk to dead people in the World of Yin. Interwoven with Olivia&rsquo;s story of her life in San Francisco are the stories told by Kwan of her former life in China. 
The sisters are the narrators, with Olivia being the primary one. The main body of the novel has Olivia relating her life in San Francisco between the 1960s and the 1990s. As Olivia grows up she continues to be embarrassed by her half sister Kwan who is twelve years older than Olivia. Kwan&rsquo;s broken English and her lack of knowledge of American ways creates a climate of bullying and teasing for Olivia as other children perceive Kwan to be a &lsquo;retard&rsquo;. This childhood trauma and subsequent dislike and resentment of Kwan bleeds through to Olivia&rsquo;s adulthood and is exacerbated by Kwan&rsquo;s interference in Olivia&rsquo;s relationship with her partner Simon.
Kwan, however, unreservedly loves her little sister even when it transpires that because of Olivia, Kwan is sent to a mental hospital due to her belief that she can see dead people. 
During Olivia&rsquo;s childhood Kwan tells her &lsquo;ghost stories&rsquo;. Stories of the dead people she sees. These stories continue into adulthood and in addition Kwan recounts stories of her past lives. 
Convolutedly, Kwan, Olivia and Simon visit China and in particular where Kwan grew up. 
The author of bestseller The Joy Luck Club, Amy Tan, has crafted an ornate, chiaroscuro like piece of work with The Hundred Secret Senses. The novel is about America and China, life and death, cultural incongruities and the difficulty of filial devotion to one&rsquo;s siblings.
However, fundamentally the novel is about relationships; the relationship between married couples, siblings, parents and their children and the most difficult relationship we all face, between the living and the dead. Amy Tan handles all these issues with adroit aplomb."

The Gargoyle,0385524943,Andrew Davidson,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"A story that starts in the Fourteenth Century and ends in   ours, a love story between the enigmatic sculptor   Marienne Engles and the narrator of the book .    After surviving a horrendous car   accident in which leaves him badly burned and injured   beyond belief our narrator meets our heroine Marrianne   Engles a world renowned sculptor who begins telling him   stories about her life and how they first  met.  She then   beguiles him with other love stories over the centuries.   As he recovers we meet other people who influence the   characters and add to the story.  This is a definite must read."
The Gargoyle,0385524943,Andrew Davidson,Barnes and Noble,4.3,ti-amo,"Such a unique and well written story! One I won't soon forget. I agree with other reviewers that it is hard to pick up another book right away after finishing the Gargoyle. It is a book in which the characters are so well developed you can't stop thinking about what they are doing now. That to me is great writing, to transform words on paper to feeling like you have a relationship with these people. Such a complex novel that was well thought out and thoroughly researched. When I purchased the book, I was a little worried that I wouldn't be able to remain interested in it, being that it does switch back and forth between present and past. But that was not an issue AT ALL, it flowed perfectly. I enjoyed it so much that I wish it was a series. So great job Mr. Davidson, I anxiously await your next book!"
The Gargoyle,0385524943,Andrew Davidson,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"If I had only one word to describe this book it would have to be intriguing.  If I had only one category it would have to be a love story; however, it is so so much more than just any love story.  It transcends centuries, cultures, and lifestyles.  It made me believe in the everlastingness of the soul, and the love you have is taken with you throughout eternity.   The story is quirky, at times smutty, a little bit sci-fi, containing some aspects of action-adventure, yet achingly human.  
A vain porn star is burnt in a fire caused by his own actions.  Looks and daily functions gone, pain his company and addiction to pain-killers present, he is nursed back to health by a woman of questionable sanity. As she nurses him to health, he learns of her past encounters with life which span centuries.  She convinces him that their love has been since before his present life, and as he increases she decreases. 
I can't recommend this book to children or teenagers due to language and content; however, those aspects should not influence an open minded person from enjoying one of the better books written in the last 20 years."
"Quicksilver (The Baroque Cycle, #1)",0060593083,Neal Stephenson,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"Thusfar all the 'complaints' regarding this book are that it's too long, the dialog is too stiff, and that there's no plot.  History doesn't have a plot.  Life doesn't have a plot.  This book is a portrait of what life was like in the 1600's. It's not a neatly packaged story with a clear beginning and ending.  Think of the Baroque Cycle books as a history lesson with personality.  If you don't like history, or don't care about how aspects of our lives came to pass, then this isn't the book for you.    As for the 'passivity' of the characters in the story... in order to maintain the historical integrity of real world events the *fictional characters* kinda need to be passive.  Daniel Waterhouse doesn't do anything of consequence because Daniel Waterhouse didn't really exist... what would you have him do? Invent something? Cure something? Kill someone?  Daniel Waterhouse is the camera-man through which we can watch Neal Stephenson's retelling of real-world history.    If you want pure fiction, look elsewhere.  This is a masterfully disguised history lesson."
"Quicksilver (The Baroque Cycle, #1)",0060593083,Neal Stephenson,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Golfer76,"Although this is fictional and staged during one of the greatest periods of scienctific discovery, it is not science fiction. The many historical characters act and perform as they did in their exciting times.  Questioning everything, from science to religion to financial systems to governmental forms, the delightfully real and fictional characters live each day to learn, educating the reader at the same time.  Lest this 1000 page volume 1 of the Baroque Trilogy sound daunting, rest assured that the creative inclusion of lovable scoundrels keep you laughing and wondering what mess is around the next corner.  A sure bet for avid readers with scientific, financial, historical, or philosophical interests."
"Quicksilver (The Baroque Cycle, #1)",0060593083,Neal Stephenson,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"As a Stephenson fan, I opened this book with high hopes.  Alas, they were quickly dashed.  He shovels up mountainous descriptions of landscapes and architecture and period costumery, religious and political and scientific intrigues, but all to no purpose in advancing the action. A second flaw is that he pastes much of this description into dialogue form, making conversations between the characters stilted and artificial.        Stephenson is undeniably brilliant; but he needs to cut more and write tighter.  What might have been a decent 400-page story unfortunately balloons to 900+ pages."

"The Fairy-Tale Detectives (The Sisters Grimm, #1)",0810959259,"Michael Buckley, Peter Ferguson",Barnes and Noble,4.6,Cookery,"I'm not a child psychologist but I believe author, Michael Buckley has gifted the middle graders of today with his creation of the Sisters Grimm series. At a time when  adolescence is looming up ahead and plush toys are packed away, the protagonists in The Fairy Tale Detectives successfully mirror the average ten-year-old's conflicts. And successfully soothe worries away.  By introducing less than perfect princesses and pigs from famous fairy tales, Buckley allows readers to embrace the fantasy world of the six-year-old while encouraging a soupcon of suspicion that all is not what it appears in the world. Although hugely entertaining, this adventure also provides a place where greater acceptance of self and reality are fostered."
"The Fairy-Tale Detectives (The Sisters Grimm, #1)",0810959259,"Michael Buckley, Peter Ferguson",Barnes and Noble,4.6,Victoria-Star,"Ah, the sister's Grimm. Ever since I picked up the first volume at a bookstore i have long been a fan (that's about 2 or 3 years, to be exact) These books got it all, baby! Fun, humor, sparkles of romance (esp. as the series progress) adventure, mystery, SUSPENSE...they're plain awesome and undoubtedly one of my favorite series of all time for me.
Sabrina and Daphne set foot into a magical town, where almost all the residents are REAL fairy-tale characters. Think Disney World- Snow White teaches kirate, Prince Charming runs the town, Sleeping Beauty owns a cofee shop. Sounds fun right? Well, there's more, lots and i mean lots of these characters arent as, well, fluffy and charming as you may tend to believe. Most are downright wicked, and despise humans. so when Sabrin and Daphne are sent to live with their grandmother in this little magical town, it sets off a chain of funny, adventrous, and simply delightful reads. So far, there are 7 in this series. Each one better than the next. 
As for content? Look no further. Absoutle no language and no sex. Kisses and flirtations are shared, sometimes more strongly as the series progress, but nothing you could even call sensual. Violence is kept at a minium, but there may be just enought to ward off younger kids. There is plenty of crude humor (sometimes it makes me squirm- thats my only dislike of these books) but it's nothing bad, think Shrek crude humor. To grasp the delight of these books, i would reccomend readers 10/11 and older. Adults will adore these series, and catch things kids do not. It's pure fun and charm for all ages. The covers are simply beautiful, and the illustraitions are loveable and classic-worthy. These books are a classic all their own. I believe the true Brothers Grimm would be so proud, if not a little green with envy at all the hype and attention these strong girls are getting. I can promise that if you read this series, you will NOT be dissapointed.

"Birthmarked (Birthmarked, #1)",1596435690,Caragh M. O'Brien,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Lawral,"Set on the shores of Unlake Michigan, this dystopian world has me hooked. Following some kind of environmental fallout that resulted in not nearly enough water to go around, the difference between the haves and the have-nots grows much more pronounced. What used to be the northern United States becomes something resembling a feudal city-state. The have-nots in Wharfton, where Gaia lives, depend on the ""good people"" of the Enclave for water to survive. And a bleak survival it is. Gaia and her parents do alright; there are only three of them and both her parents work, her mother as a midwife and her father as a tailor. Gaia's new status as a full midwife should have brought her family the Wharfton version of luxury: plenty of water and extra passes to the local entertainment center, Tvaltar. The Enclave also could not exist without those in Wharfton. Though there are bakers, tailors, and other services available right inside the wall, the people of Wharfton provide much of the labor and services the Enclave requires.

And the babies. The people of Wharfton also provide Enclave families with babies.

At first I thought this was going to be a situation like that in The Handmaid's Tale where most women become sterile and those who still can are pressed into service as babymakers. That is not the case here, though why the Enclave needs Wharfton babies remains a mystery for most of the book. Many people on both sides of the wall believe, like Gaia herself, that the children sent to the Enclave are simply lucky, even while their parents are left heart-broken; they have a chance at a much easier life. The Protectorat, the ruling class of the Enclave, have a much more complicated need for children born in Wharfton. Luckily (not really) Gaia is caught pretty early on on her attempt to rescue her parents and so gets to meet the key people behind the ""advancement"" program.

After Gaia is captured in the Enclave, where she has no right to be, she learns so much more about the history of her society and world than she could have imagined. She learns just how the Enclave uses those in Wharfton and the vital part she and her mother play in that relationship as midwives. She learns that her parents, who she trusted implicitly and thought she knew inside and out, hid very important things about themselves and their family from her. She learns what they hid about her own past. And during all of this acquisition of knowledge, she makes some unlikely allies inside the wall and, of course, falls in love with an especially broody, high-ranking member of the military who seems to hate her and yet find her interesting.

It's a lot for one girl to go through. And it's all a set-up. It was an emotional thrill ride the whole way through with an ending just barely satisfying enough to not make me want to tear my hair out.

I can't wait for Book 2.

I was slowly drawn in by the story of Gaia and her determination to fight for what is right, not just what is popular. I loved how the little pieces of her past start to fall together. I have the second book on it's way, should be here tomorrow, and have already pre-ordered Promised. I look forward to reading Prized! I think it was a great book to follow The Hunger Games Trilogy. If you liked this book you'll LOVE the Divergent series!"

Skulduggery Pleasant himself is a funny gentleman who has a darker side. This book is not only thrilling but it also reviews alot of things about society and such.

Pale Fire,0141185260,Vladimir Nabokov,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"Never have I despised a novel's protagonist more than I do the excruciating Charles Kinbote as he dragged me through his interpretation, and subsequent self-promoting butchery, of his 'dear  friend's' poem. So much so that I regularly had to remind myself that it wasn't real.  And that's one of the great things about this book; whilst reading it we spend so much time wondering whether Kinbote is telling the truth or not that we forget that none of it's real at all. I got the distinct impression that I was being led to jump through hoops by Nabakov, whilst he sat back and laughed. In so far as I'm fit to judge, this is a work of true genius."
Pale Fire,0141185260,Vladimir Nabokov,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"Pale Fire is a novel obsessed with the relation between fiction and truth, text and life, that which is read and that which is experienced.  It is unfortunate that Nabokov is known almost exclusively for Lolita (quite possibly his least interesting and most pedestrian work), when such novels as The Defense, Pnin, and Pale Fire go unnoticed by most readers.  Pale Fire, a challenging and exceedingly deep book, is one of the finest examples in any language of exploring the reader's relationship to a novel.  In a mature, exact fashion, Nabokov uses this book to not only tell a fascinating story to his audience, but also to show how that story is both true, a lie, an experience, a dream, an epic poem, and possibly something even more amorphous than that.  Recommended to anyone you wishes for more than simple entertainment or cheap thrill in their reading."
Pale Fire,0141185260,Vladimir Nabokov,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"Although I desperately needed to keep reading this story, I needed just as much to stop, close my eyes, shake my head, tilt it back and smile a broad smile of worshipful delight at Vladimir Nabokov doing it again, giving me just what I wanted when I wanted it. He lets you into his private mind, and I feel privileged!"
The Lady and the Unicorn,0452285453,Tracy Chevalier,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"I was very pleasantly surprised when I picked up this book.  I knew the author from the prior Virgin Blue, but I wasn't expecting to quickly become as absorbed as I did.  The book is amazingly detailed and in turn a fascinating world is created."
The Lady and the Unicorn,0452285453,Tracy Chevalier,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"Absorbing and colorful. The author has a wonderful talent for historical writing.Her grasp of the arts and how they were achieved back then was excellent. The characters were clear and interesting, keeping me reading all night long. I cannot wait for the author's next book!"
The Lady and the Unicorn,0452285453,Tracy Chevalier,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"Having recently visited the Cluny Museum and viewed the beautiful tapestries which are the true stars of this story, I was especially eager to read Ms. Chevalier's latest novel.  I was not disappointed in this tale of the lusty, handsome artist commissioned to design the tapestries for a wealthy patron who has more interest in making a fine impression than in works of art.  With the skill of a fine weaver, the author creates a stunning tale through her use of interwoven points of view.  The setting is five hundred years ago, yet it is easy to identify with the characters' hopes, dreams, and disappointments. The descriptions of the ongoing process of creating a magnificent and intricate tapestry at a time when everything was done painstakingly by hand are fascinating.  This is a wonderful story that once started is very, very difficult to put down."

One More Thing: Stories and Other Stories,0385351836,B.J. Novak,Barnes and Noble,3.6,CliffWhoReads,"This is a wonderfully humorous collection of thoughts and stories, most of which involve unusual twists and viewpoints.  For that reason, it is difficult to provide a descriptive review without including spoilers.  It would be like reviewing O&rsquo;Henry without revealing his surprise endings.  One cannot do justice to the work with that approach.



Now, this is not O&rsquo;Henry.  The stories are somewhat less serious and the characters are less empathetic.  But that is not necessarily bad.  These stories and characters are from our present age.  The people are social networkers who have a more holistic worldview, and they can laugh about themselves with the author and reader alike.




And I laughed.  For this is a very funny and enjoyable book to read.  Even the lesser stories, and some can be no more than a few well written lines, are thought provoking in a light hearted way."

"Carpe Corpus (The Morganville Vampires, #6)",0451227190,Rachel Caine,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"it ties up all the loose ends, and completely satisfies what the readers want. Shane is so amazing with Claire, i love their relationship with each other, so glad it finally happens. it had me hanging on edge to figure out what would happen between the vampires and humans. it puts the drama in at the perfect times. I'm so going to reread it. Can't wait  for the next one!"
"Carpe Corpus (The Morganville Vampires, #6)",0451227190,Rachel Caine,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"Somehow, this series gets better and better with each book! Carpe Corpus had lots of unexpected turns. Love, friendship, and suspense kept my attention glued to the pages until I was finished. I'm absolutely in love with these characters...and that was only further solidified in this installment! I can't get enough of them and I'm happy to know that I'm only half way through the books (there are supposed to be 12, at least for now)."

I loved that Shane and Claire... sorry I'm not going to ruin it for those who have not read it yet. This series for me ranks higher than Twilight. I hated the cliff hanger but if you are like me and just can't wait until November 3,2009, then you can go onto her website and read the first three chapters of Fade Out. This series is utterly extraordinary!"
"Asylum (Asylum, #1)",0062220969,Madeleine Roux,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Anonymous,"I was excited about the plot and use of photos. I couldn't wait to read the book being compaired to Miss Peregrin's Home for Peculiar Children. Unfortunatly, this book fell short of expectations. The characterization tried to be dynamic but instead the characters came across as unfleshed out. I never had a grasp on who they were supposed to be. The use of photos was strange because they didn't run congruently with the text, they seemed random at times. Further more, the end (and I promise not to spoil) was not a satisfactory resolution to the plot and didn't provide a compelling cliff hanger for a sequel. I have since learned this is the first in a series but I will not be reading the subsequent books."
"Asylum (Asylum, #1)",0062220969,Madeleine Roux,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Anonymous,"Very, very disappointing.  The book was so badly written that I could not suspend reality at all and the story just ended up being silly.  This is a shame since it is a very good plot line.  The pictures could have easily been left out as they added very little to the story.  I was also very disappointed that Ms. Roux gave no thanks or credit to Ransom Rees, who had an excellent &quot;picture&quot; book with Ms. Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, which was actually written around real, unusual pictures.  It is also pretty obvious that Ms. Roux did no research on how lobotomies were performed.  If she had, she would have found out that they were done through the eye socket - NOT  through the forehead.  The characters were all, except for poor Lucy, one-dimensional and extraordinarily self-centered who were constantly throwing fits when they did not get their way.  All in all they were all very pathetic.  This could have been a very good the hands of a better writer or even a better editor.  As it is, well, this is just my opinion, but it pretty much sucked."
"Asylum (Asylum, #1)",0062220969,Madeleine Roux,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Anonymous,"Seriously, did the author literally write all of the five star reviews herself.  This is the deal with this book, it did set up some good storyline but it was not executed properly!  The author could not write or get into the mind of a teenage boy, she write that the main character is socially awkward but gets best friends not soon after that statement.  She makes one of the characters gay so she can relate her novel to the LGBTQ community but that's it.  She just says that he's gay and doesn't go farther than that.  I seriously hope that the writer goes back to school or at least find herself another job.  I usually don't hate books but this book, oh this book is seriously a waste of money.  The author is seriously trying to rip off Miss Peregrine's home for pecular children!"
The Heart Goes Last,0385540353,Margaret Atwood,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Deb-Krenzer,"This was my first book by Margaret Atwood, yes I know where have I been? It's not because I was trying not to. I just hadn't had the chance so far. I will say that this one was definitely a different kind of book. Not sure if this is an usual kind for her or not. But, in the whole realm of reading, it was a different kind of reading. 

I very much enjoyed reading the book and it definitely kept me interested. There were some definitely far out things going on in this story. I never did understand why they lived in regular housing for one month and then a prison cell for another month and then start the trend all over again. That was kind of strange. However, I guess it kept life from becoming monotonous. Also, I'm not sure I would like to share my house every other month with someone else either. But, it sure beat living in a car. I couldn't imagine that.

There were some pretty creepy characters in this story. Some of them felt almost too robotic as if they felt no emotion or had no feelings. But the main characters felt and acted human. 

There was some mention of sex in here, but it wasn't that bad and it was referred to several times, but it wasn't like in the romance books or anything so I don't think it would be enough to put people off.

I thought that while the story was strange, it was very enjoyable and I would definitely recommend it especially if your into dystopian novels.

Thanks Doubleday Books and Net Galley for providing me with this free e-galley in exchange for an honest review."
The Heart Goes Last,0385540353,Margaret Atwood,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Anonymous,"One of the most ridiculous stories i have ever read, what a waste of time!"
The Heart Goes Last,0385540353,Margaret Atwood,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Sandy5,"They lost almost everything when the economy went belly up and now they lived in their car.  Stan was getting tired of the situation while Charmaine tried to remain positive although her new working conditions at the Pixel Dust bar, were less than ideal.  When Charmaine saw the commercial for the   Positron Project, she knew this was their way out.  

The Positron Project was a serious commitment and as the couple was put through a screening process and a waiting period, Stan’s brother tried to warn him about the dangers in his future.  Charmaine already had made up her mind though. 

The project. Who thinks of these things? As I read about this idea, I had to wonder about this author and how she came up with this idea. Then, I thought about the individuals who had signed up for this type of society, freely without any pressure.  Life on the outside must have been pretty miserable for them. Did they really know what lies ahead for their future?  

The project runs on a monthly cycle.  One month an individual or a couple would live in a house and they would be treated as civilians.  At the end of the month, they would go to their lockers and change their clothes.  Putting on their prisoner apparel, they would now become prisoners for a month and live in another section of the project. This same exchange would occur with individuals who were prisoners last month, only they would now be putting on civilian clothes and they now would be living in the houses that the civilians just left.  It’s an exchange program.  The same people live in the same house only in different times, cleaning up after themselves before they leave.  These individuals are to never, ever see who they share their houses with.

If you think about the tone within the project, things have to be running pretty smoothly.  As a resident, you experience both ends of the spectrum.  

For Charmaine and Stan, they were enjoying the project.  Life seemed easier, they both had jobs and knew what was expected of them but of course, they hit a bump as Stan makes a discovery. The novel got pretty interesting then as it was one twist after another until I wasn’t sure what the heck was happening.  There’s this master plan, I know there had to be, but who was in charge and what was the purpose? 

I felt like an investigator, leaping around, keeping track of all the dirt I was uncovering.  By the time the whole plan was ironed out, I was shaking my head.  I felt like I had been bounced around in a pinball machine during that second half of the novel.  That was crazy.  I liked parts of it as I felt it was very creative and interesting and there were other parts that I thought were confusing and rushed.  

It is after I have finished this novel that I am told that this is part of a series, I don’t know if I will read the others in the series. I’ll need to read the synopsis but I think I should have read the first book to help me understand this book better."
"A Fistful of Charms (The Hollows, #4)",0060788194,Kim Harrison,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Ozzy12,"Loved it. Great book, great story. I was very entertained."
"A Fistful of Charms (The Hollows, #4)",0060788194,Kim Harrison,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Kasia_S,"Obviously I would not recommit this book to anyone who has not read the previous three installments, this series is so mouth wateringly good that you cannot miss a beat; it would truly be a loss for anyone to read this out of order. That aside I will keep the narration of this book short and sweet, ruining or giving anything away is the worst favor anyone can do with this series, the surprises emerge like spring flowers through the snow and action builds up with no sights set up on stopping anytime soon. This book does not disappoint, there's drama, action, love and lots of good old fashioned fighting. I was enamored with this story and where it took the characters, it promises a good story continuation from here on! Rachel is still amongst the living even though her luck has been stretching thin and what is in store for her in this novel is a big chunk of adventure. Kim Harrison really puts her all in her books, from the moment I open each novel I feel the warm welcome of the cozy church Rachel, Ivy and Jenks live in. The big kitchen with the wooden counter, large windows overlooking the pixy garden and the pots and pans, brownies baking or pizza sauce simmering and constant foods and spells Rachel is cooking up makes he hungry, she also simmers smells and makes charms, while I can't make those, at least reading about her cozy cooking makes me feel teleported into her world. The real charm of these books is the strength of characters and their bond with each other; Rachel the bounty hunter,then there's Ivy, her slinky hot vampire roommate with her almond shaped eyes, wearing leather and always defending her territory like a lioness and Jenks, mischievous and charming pixy with a great attitude, they are all familiar to but but they have a new problem on their hands. Nick, Rachel's missing ex-boyfriend is in trouble, and it includes an island bathed in mist, occupied by wild packs of werewolves. This book made me salivate and drool; finally the vampires make some room for the real monstrums in this book and with the help of some black demon magic, something that I can just tell will bite her back later, Rachel does the unthinkable, she finds a way to transform into a werewolf. I can not saying one more thing, the tale was sizzling and intense and things that happened between Rachel and Ivy almost made me fall out of bed. Hot hot hot....Something is happening between the powers of the wolves and the vampires and Rachel finds herself in midst of a huge new conflict. Read this and you will know it all! I was thinking that my only complaint would be how long this book was, but honestly, after I read the last page I was looking up across the room for book five and then at the clock, then decided that 2;30 am is not the best time for starting a new Harrison book, it might lead to reading till my eyes fell and having to call out of work, not fair to others, so here I am, sitting here and trying to restrain myself from devouring the next installment. It's always a battle to try and hold on, the author is not only a generous and wonderful woman but she writes with so much love and humor and passion I hope she lives to be a thousand and writes millions of these books. She's funny like Xena, you know the warrior princess with brains and brawn, well she's just like her but a whole new combination of strong and cool, something you want in a writer that will knock you socks off. - Kasia S."

The Coldest Girl in Coldtown,0316213101,Holly Black,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Kristas_Dust_Jacket,"One thing I've noticed about vampires in many of today's books is that they've been romanticized to the point where they're not really all that scary any more. Think about the vampires you know the best - Edward from the Twilight series, the Brothers from the Black Dagger Brotherhood, Simon from The Mortal Instruments. These are the sexy, sweet vampires who don't kill humans and love their women fiercely.

Holly Black has reminded us in The Coldest Girl in Coldtown that vampires are inherently evil and bad and so scary. When I learned that this book was about vampires, I was prepared for the usual. What I got instead was something dark, bloody and freaky. It was awesome!

Tana wakes up the morning after a party and 48 of her friends are dead. She discovers her ex-boyfriend and a vampire chained in a room and saves them. The three of them set off for Coldtown, with Tana having every intention of returning home when her cargo is delivered. Things don't happen according to plan, though, and before she knows it, Tana finds herself fighting for her life as she knows it.

The Coldest Girl in Coldtown is unique in many ways. In it, our world knows about vampires and fears them. Vampirism is treated as a disease, and something that can be fought - like a cold. It's a different way of looking at it, for sure.

Let's talk characters. Tana was an awesome heroine. She had something truly awful happen to her as a child, and although that event certainly helped shape her, it hasn't defined her like we see so many times in characters that are in situations like this. She's brave and strong and smart. She's cautious when she needs to be, and she doesn't blindly trust anyone.

Gavriel was... wow. He was something else. A centuries-old vampire who is more than a little nuts-o, yet young-looking and hot (of course!) and so dynamic. He says the craziest things, and pairs them with moments of lucidity that make you think that perhaps there's a method to his madness. And, there's definitely more to him than what meets the eye - that was evident from the very first moment we see him.

The way that Black layered the chapters with one flashback followed by one present-day helped to slowly develop the characters and the world so that it wasn't so much info dump all at once. I did appreciate that a lot.

The other thing I appreciated is that, although there is a very nice slow burn romance, it wasn't thrust in with a crowbar. Many times, a romance is added just for people like me who need something like that in my stories. Not because the story calls for it. In this case, the romance is a little darker, but no less sweet. Gavriel is an a-typical hero and leading man, and I was okay with that. I still fell in love with him, just like Tana did.

At 419 pages, The Coldest Girl in Coldtown is a smidge long. It could've been tightened up some. Some of the flashback chapters felt unnecessary. In fact, I think the addition of Tana's sister Pearl was completely nonessential to the main story, and I don't think I would've felt like I was missing anything important if she had been omitted entirely.

Despite that, I really loved the dark and foreboding aspect of this story. The romance that I need was there, although it wasn't prominent. The heroes are exciting. The villains are confusing in a very good way (Are they all bad? Good? How bad are they?). If you like vampire stories even a little, you really should give this one a shot. I can't wait to see where Black takes this story next."
The Coldest Girl in Coldtown,0316213101,Holly Black,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"This shows all just how horrid Twilight &amp; other Vampire stories with little-to-no plot and only romance.
Really, Twilight had quite 1-dimensional characters, while this makes you feel for them.
This story takes you back to true vampires- Scary, blood sucking monsters.
This has an amazing plot, the premise of Coldtowns, and interesting characters.
Crazy plot twist in the end- I recommend this to anyone that likes to read!"

"Feast of Fools (The Morganville Vampires, #4)",0451224639,Rachel Caine,Barnes and Noble,4.5,LVB4H8T,"The ""Morganville Vampires"" books, despite their short page count (""Feast of Fools"" came in at under 300 pages) manage a balance between development, plot, action, and dialogue that is rarely accomplished well even in books twice the page count. I remember a time when I feared that Claire's point of view might become tedious, that her bookishness and logical internalization might interfere with the direction of the books. Boy was I wrong, and ""Feast of Fools"" shows just how far young Claire has come: from a shy, reserved teenager to a genuine heroine who is smart, loyal, stands by her convictions, and yet a part of her dreads the role she's been given and wishes she could be a normal teenager. Even Eve, Michael, and Shane have grown to understand that their experiences in the town of Morganville have to be pushed aside to defeat Mr. Bishop. The best thing about ""Feast of Fools"" is that the interactions between Claire, Eve, Michael and Shane have evolved into such a tangible, intricate understanding and their relationship and care for one another shows. Michael, still dealing with his vampirism, is fighting to stay true to himself and hiding the parts of him that crave blood and put his friends in danger. Eve is forced to deal with her family when tragedy strikes, and is still unsure how to handle her deadly brother. And Shane is visibly trying to accept what Michael has become, and his relationship with Claire becomes conflicted when one of Mr. Bishop's vampires tries to control him, body and soul. Like the prior Morganville series, this story was darn near impossible to put down. It's also not a stand-alone--so beware, you're going to want to have ""Lord of Misrule"" close at hand, because I promise you will not want to wait too long to find out what happens next. This would be a great TV series."
"Feast of Fools (The Morganville Vampires, #4)",0451224639,Rachel Caine,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"Since the arrival of Bishop, Morganville has gotten stranger than it already seems. Claire's parents have decided to move to Morganville, much to her utter surprise. Not only that but there's an upcoming event called the Feast of Fools. As the town of Morganville prepares for the feast, Claire has a feeling that something's not right about it. Awesome series that you should definitely read."
"Feast of Fools (The Morganville Vampires, #4)",0451224639,Rachel Caine,Barnes and Noble,4.5,bre3307,When I first picked up this series I was unsure of what I would find. I was looking for a new exciting series. Once I picked it up though I couldn't put it down! When Clarie was struggling to find her way in her new town I felt it all with her. The author is very desriptive and good with emotion. Book four has been one of my favorites so far. The action is intense and keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole book. Especially when she becomes friends with a crazy old vampire who is losing his mind! Trust me this is one series you will absolutely love!
Consider the Lobster and Other Essays,0316156116,David Foster Wallace,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with David Foster Wallace's writing. In fact it is superb. I've given the nook book version of his essay collection only one star because it is missing probably one his most interesting pieces, ""Host."" Perhaps the reason is because the form is so strange and it couldn't be adapted to a nook book format. However, I don't buy this excuse. The hard copy is cheaper (online) and complete, so buy that one instead."
Consider the Lobster and Other Essays,0316156116,David Foster Wallace,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"David Foster Wallace has looked into the heart of American.  I think he saw all we are/were and had trouble coming to grips with it.  A man for all seasons.   His writing reminds me of the character Homer Simpson in that we all have a trait that is a fault, so you can either take a step back and laugh at yourself, or you reject the truth of it.  Those who reject the truth often can not look at themselves with a truly enlighten and open mind.  The truth is out faults are what make us most human and in that respect most endearing."
Consider the Lobster and Other Essays,0316156116,David Foster Wallace,Barnes and Noble,4,WithKnivesOut,"David Foster Wallace is the best writer you haven't read. This book of essays allows the reader to get a great idea of how he writes. He's witty, amusing, well-researched, and talented. I cannot speak for his short stories or other fiction, but his essays were very fun to read.Note, his favorite essay technique is the footnote, so be prepared. Every essay is an exercise for the eye as much as the brain."

Orion is hilarious and humiliating, and Artemis (therefore Mr. Colfer) once again proved his (their?) genius-ness. The plot is a good one, though I admit that it's more moral-filled than the others. I prefer just reading about Butler and Holly blowing things up together and Artemis carrying out his schemes. I like Angeline's part in the book and after I finished reading I wanted to design Atlantis #3 and get arrested just so I could test the security. Once again, this was an amazing book and Colfer is well on his way to becoming my new role-model. Goos job to him, and I think everyone familiar with the story- or comedy- should definitly read this book."
"The Atlantis Complex (Artemis Fowl, #7)",1423128192,Eoin Colfer,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"This series is definitely ONE OF THE BEST I've ever read. I am a big fantasy lover and this is definitely in my collection. I think all around, it is FANTASTIC! It is funny, exciting, smart...I hope the latest will be as good as the rest! :) The WHOLE SERIES has been amazing so far. Keep it up, Eoin! :)"
"The Atlantis Complex (Artemis Fowl, #7)",1423128192,Eoin Colfer,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"You will either love/appreciate this latest installment, or be severely disappointed. The most likely cause for disappointment would be Artemis's strange absence - psychologically that is. Artemis is suffering from Atlantis Complex, symptoms including OCD, paranoia and multiple personality disorder among many other psychological issues. As a result, the Artemis we know and have grown fond of is.not entirely 'there'. And as a result, Artemis's alter ego, Orion, often takes over. And Orion is hardly a genius. Granted, Colfer does an amazing job with this new Orion fellow as well as the remaining characters. The dark humor is there, the one-liners present, Mulch's sarcasm as vibrant as ever and the banter is perfect. And when 'Artemis' (not Orion) is present, the novel holds true to its predecessors. Don't get me wrong, Orion is a riot and I laughed more than once when he showed up, but there is a reason I picked up the Artemis Fowl book.and it most certainly was not because I wanted a book about this Orion guy. So where is Artemis? Oh, he's there. In bite size pieces and as a result, it would seem as though this novel were severely lacking. But despite Orion's humor, the novel is darker than any of the others before it, not only because of the strange emphasis on emotions, but because Artemis and the gang always seem a step or two behind their adversary as opposed to a dozen steps ahead. We're so used to the ingenuous Artemis being so far ahead of the game that by the time we manage to understand the twists and turns, we're struck with awe. But now the team can't seem to catch up effectively - and this new vulnerability brings another aspect into play; and makes the reader shiver with anxiety in an entirely new way. I do miss Artemis's deductions and the rapid twists and turns that leave me in the dust. What's worse is that this new adversary isn't nearly as formidable as Opal Koboi (whose name I genuinely fear). Yes, this novel was very different. But it was darker and in that sense, better. Yet, the boy we've become accustomed to seeing isn't there. And that for me, as a reader, was painful enough. But maybe this was Colfer's point in the end - this new vulnerability that the characters face. This novel runs deeper than the others and the emotions are stronger and that much more terrifying. Under this new lens - then it is probably the best in the series. After all, no other Fowl book has had this effect on me once I put it down. Even now there is a looming darkness that I cannot seem to place. This novel is very different. But if you read it, expecting another 'Fowl' novel, you will be disappointed. Instead, I suggest reading it under a new lens that has not been stained by expectation and to appreciate the differences and what it has to offer. This latest installment is good.very good but for different reasons entirely. And this strange drift away from the other novels can we welcomed - once. If Colfer repeats this venture again, I can confidently say that this new plot line has overstayed its welcome. But for now - this book was strangely amazing and definitely unforgettable."
Merrick (The Vampire Chronicles #7),0345422406,Anne Rice,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Fuarie,From the beginning I could not put this book down. Normally it takes a while to get through one of the Mrs. Rice's vampire books for me...even though I love them to death...not this one. I read through it so quick I amazed myself. The story throwing in a surprising twist of when the world of the Mayfair witches and the Vampires finally unit with the stunning new character of Merrick. Anne Rice never disappoints!
Merrick (The Vampire Chronicles #7),0345422406,Anne Rice,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Aimee_Leon,"This book was extremely exciting & thrilling that it's just too hard to put down. I love the strong and wicked enchanted female character of Merrick. I also love how Anne Rice shows how vampires can be humanly vulnerable with their emotions & nature. 

 It was wonderful to have the vampire collide with the witches. Especially to have Lestat, Louie & David back together. I simply loved it from beginning to the end. I would recommend anyone to read this book."

The Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays,0679733736,"Albert Camus, Justin O'Brien",Barnes and Noble,4.1,MerleF,"This is a specialized book, mostly for those interested in philosophy, French culture, and Camus the writer.  I bought it as I had read more about Camus in Brave Genius by S B Carroll, a book about Camus and J. Monod, both Nobel Prize winners.

The Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays,0679733736,"Albert Camus, Justin O'Brien",Barnes and Noble,4.1,P_S_Patrick on LibraryThing,"This certainly isn't dry philosophy, and it deals with big questions, but it is more a work of aesthetics than it is of metaphysics. The main theme is the absurdity of the human condition, God, (or the absence of God), and the meaning (or lack of meaning) of life. Camus discusses whether we ought to commit suicide, in light of our absurdity, or whether it is better to carry on living, and he reaches the conclusion that we needn't kill ourselves. Which is reassuring.I say this is more a work of aesthetics than metaphysics, despite the main theme being existence, for the reason that all the arguments are supported with judgements of value, rather than with rigorous logic. He says we ought to live so that we can make the most of the freedom which we would not have if we were dead, the sensations that are only available to the living, and the irony of knowingly living an absurd life. He uses the illustrations of Don Juan, and the actor, and talks about the characters of Dostoievsky and Kafka. But why classify a work, it is more than aesthetics, and metaphysics, it is art also. Not the completely rational type of art, but the type that tells us something about the artist. Apart from the main essay, the shorter ones at the end are about places he has been to, including Algiers and Oman, and they are very atmospheric. They fluctuate between melancholy and joy, and make me want to visit the places, though I wouldn't want to live in them. I don't necessarily agree with all of his views, but I think the main ones are sound enough. His philosophy seems to be self consistent, which is important, but I found it a touch vague."
"Someday, Someday, Maybe",0345532740,Lauren Graham,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Deidra_Simply_Books,"A Book Full of Lauren Graham Humor!
 I'm a Gilmore fan.  I bawled when the the finale aired.  BAWLED.  So when I saw a debut novel by THE Lauren Graham, I knew that I had to read it.  I honestly had to expectations other than I knew it would be funny edging towards snarky.  And my dear readers, it was that indeed. 
I'm not going to re-summarize the story.  The summary above does a decent job of that.  I'm going to give you the low-down on the book though.  Lauren Graham depicts a great deal of her personality into this story.  There was a reason that people loved Gilmore Girls, and a big chunk of that reason was the quirky personality Lauren Graham played.  There was so much of that kind of personality in the book complete with the long-winded and super humorous rants.  The book is full of light humor, and the struggles of a woman trying to make it in the world of theater as an actress.  The story may be predictable, but the refreshing perspective full of humor and clever wit was a huge selling point for me. 
Since I am not normally one to really get into chick-lit, liking this book was a pretty big deal.  Franny, the main character, is incredibly self-depracting in a way that I actually admired and related to.  She wants success, but she struggles with getting it on her own terms with her dignity in tact.  She ends up in a relationship with a guy that is just all wrong.  But there is an incredibly sweet guy waiting that just adores her.  Dan is probably one of the sweetest and awkward characters I've met in awhile.  
The book may be chick-lit, but the story is well-thought out and relatable.  I appreciated the story I was being told, and enjoyed spending some time reading the words of Lauren Graham.  Also, the character is named after Franny from J.D. Salinger's short story.  I love it when authors include that story into their own.  
Low Points:  It was pretty predictable.  I had to spend more time with James, a love interest, than I would have liked.  There was a bit of flip flopping on Franny's part that drove me a lot crazy at times.  High Points:  Well of course the humor.  There were a lot of scenes that if I just pictured Ms. Graham doing them, they became even funnier in my mind.  I loved the 90's references and reading the different messages left on her answering machine.  *I honestly miss the old-fashioned answering machines.*  Also ever so once in a while, Franny's Filofax pages are shown, and it was fun to read the different things written on them.  
Who Should Read It:  Did/do you love Gilmore Girls?  If you enjoyed the humor of the show, you will probably enjoy the book.  Lovers of chick-lit and light fiction may enjoy it as well."
"Someday, Someday, Maybe",0345532740,Lauren Graham,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"I read this book while in the hospital... I'm afraid I may have woken other patients up with my laughter. I consumed the book in less than 24 hours. It's light hearted, easy and a thoroughly enjoyable read. Totally raised my spirits when they were at their lowest."
"Someday, Someday, Maybe",0345532740,Lauren Graham,Barnes and Noble,3.9,CandyCain,"I am a Lauren Graham fan, and I LOVED Gilmore Girls. But I'm not a fan of Someday, Someday, Maybe. The story is slow and there is not much about the characters that keeps me interested. And as much as I love the quirky humor of Gilmore Girls and the rambling, incoherent but somehow charming banter, it just does not translate well on a page. &quot;uh&quot; expressed verbally can sound delightfully awkward, but on a written page only disrupts the natural flow to a story. I can't finish this, because I would be forcing myself to do so."

Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda,0062348671,Becky Albertalli,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Take_Me_AwayPH,"Reading this was like watching one of those good episodes of Catfish. Where the person is actually the person they say they are. Those are my favorite episodes. There aren't nearly enough of them. Just like there aren't nearly enough of books like this. 
     Simon doesn't like to let anyone in on his life to avoid making everything a big deal. But suddenly  his email account comes up to someone who doesn't care that Simon is trying to avoid these things. He blackmails him. Help him land someone or he'll expose his secret. The bad thing is, it's not only Simon's secret, it's Blue's (the boy he's been talking to) secret too. Eventually Simon is ready to come out to Blue... And more importantly, the world. 
     I have to admit... At the beginning I wasn't really pulled all the way in. I don't want to say it, but it seemed like there was too much hype surrounding it. I get it. It's about a very important topic that all teens that may be going through this should read, but it really felt like a regular contemp to me. Maybe because there never really was a &quot;default&quot; to me, I'm not sure. But Simon and Blue are completely cute and their emails are adorable. But at the beginning that's the only reason I wanted to keep reading. The actual story line wasn't the best for me. It moved really slow and I found myself trying to speed read through it just to get to the next emails. But towards the end the story sped up and I fell completely head over heels for their relationship. 
     As for the characters, I wasn't sure how I felt about Simon's friends and family. His sister didn't know what a dementor was, one of his friends didn't know who Jason Aldean was, and everyone was calling it &quot;the Tumblr,&quot; But otherwise all the characters were amazing besides that. One of his friends was Wonder Woman for Halloween.... We know how I felt about that lol But they were fully thought out and everyone played an important role in the story. It made it intimate and close which fit the story. 
     This story is important in so many ways. Simon shows that it's ok to not be &quot;default.&quot; As a diverse person myself, I love that this book is getting so much attention. It may start slow but in the end it will completely suck you in and you won't want to put it down."
Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda,0062348671,Becky Albertalli,Barnes and Noble,4.7,SiennaGrey,"As soon as I picked up the book I never put it down. I had heard many different things about this book, but never had the chance to read it until a couple days ago. The characters are just absolutely lovely, and you cant help but fall in love with them. I loved how it opened up about how coming out in High School can be a difficult thing, especially when you have absolutely no idea how anyone is going to react. Don't sit there and let me ramble about this book, just do me a favor and start reading it."
Wives and Daughters,014043478X,"Elizabeth Gaskell, Pam Morris",Barnes and Noble,4,Linybean,"At first, I was a little daunted by how very long this book is, but I soon found myself grateful that I got to spend so much time in its world.  This is one of the few books I started to read and just couldn't put down.  Dark circles and extra cups of coffee were present many mornings because I stayed up so late reading!  I suppose the thing I love most about Wives and Daughters is that it is a purely non-guilty pleasure.  The characters are excellently written...virtue and sympathy reign supreme.  There are no shocking twists and no, dare I say, improper scenes, and that is exactly what makes it such a good read.  Although the plot is a little predictable, it's still satisfying.  I can't wait until enough time passes so I can read it again!"
Wives and Daughters,014043478X,"Elizabeth Gaskell, Pam Morris",Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"While Gaskell is not as skillful a writer as Jane   Austen, either in language or characterization, the   story is still very much worth reading.  Although her   story is nominally a romance, the best parts of the   book are the more platonic relationships.  Heroine   Molly Gibson and her doctor father have an   understated, affectionate relationship, full of   amusing banter and genuine development.  (In fact,   although a relatively minor character, Dr. Gibson   fairly steals the story.)  Molly's relationship with her   step-sister Cynthia is interesting as well - often   frustrating, but also quite touching.  Next to these   strong depictions, Molly's romantic intrigues are   predictable and dull.      I would suggest, however, buying a different version   than the Barnes and Noble Classic Series.  I bought   this version at the store, and was very disappointed   with it.  For one thing, I was unaware that the   footnotes would spoil parts of the book - they do.    Also, I was unaware that the book doesn't have an   ending.  Yes, that's right, the book does NOT have an   ending.  The author died before writing the last few   chapters.  I was quite upset that the Barnes and   Noble Classics edition didn't warn me of this."
Wives and Daughters,014043478X,"Elizabeth Gaskell, Pam Morris",Barnes and Noble,4,lovenovels,"I just finished reading Wives and Daughters, and have to say that it was a good book. Its a very long story so it does take a while to read, however, I think that it is worth the time. Im not going to waste time reciting the plot, im also not going to 'give the story away'. Im simply going to say that if you are considering reading this book, do it! I definitely enjoyed it. I will tell you though, that the author died before completing the story, however, dont listen to the other posts which tell you that they are frustrated and unsatisfied due to the lack of an ending. Dont listen! when the story cuts out, it is very clear were the author was going to go with the story. You will not be left wondering how it was going to end. Not at all! and you will love the ending. Read this book."
"Splintered (Splintered, #1)",1419704281,A.G. Howard,Barnes and Noble,4.6,IceyBooks,"I've always been a fan of Alice in Wonderland. When I heard SPLINTERED was Wonderland, only darker and a lot more delicious, I was dying to get my hands on it. 

   Lucky for me, SPLINTERED is just as good as I expected. No, not just as good. It exceeded my expectations and topped my list of requirements. It was incredibly good. Dark and delicious. Totally awesome. 

   Yes. That good. 

   A.G. Howard knows how to keep the words flowing, the world growing, and the characters living. I'm not normally a fan of pony-tailed guys, but Jebediah Holt is an exception. I mean, come on, isn't his name hot enough? And then there's Alyssa Gardener - daughter of a madwoman who sips pot roast from a tea cup. She's a skateboarder, a bug artist, and an all around unique protagonist you won't find anywhere else. 

   And then there's Morpheus - the bad guy with a soft side and an amazing accent and fashion sense. He also happens to be a moth. I especially loved him in the end. 

   SPLINTERED is a whirlwind of fun. Dangerously thrilling tea parties, flesh-eating flowers, walrus eating clams (no, it isn't the other way around) - SPLINTERED has the whole shebang. Including a story that will make you feel all the feels and end with your heart racing. In a good way. 

   Rest assured, there isn't a cliff hanger ending, though I would love to see more of Alyssa, Jeb, and Morpheus. In fact, the ending is perfect. From start to finish, SPLINTERED is a must-read. Trust me when I say it's as gorgeous inside as it is on the outside. A.G. Howard is an author to watch."

I fell in love with Morpheous  he is tricky and wicked but also amazing and loving. I love how Alice is both dark & light/ good & bad. I love what she looks like when she's in Wonderland, truly amazing and more than beautiful! This is my top 5 favorite book! A total must read no matter how old you are!"
"Splintered (Splintered, #1)",1419704281,A.G. Howard,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Catie22,"Sometimes a book comes along that grabs hold of you with every quirky, wonderful thing it has and doesn't let go.  You become completely engrossed in the author's world and when you have to come back down from your cloud  it's completely disorienting.  Splintered is that book.  Like many of you I grew up loving Alice In Wonderland.  I'll admit it gave me some pretty interesting nightmares as a kid but mostly I fell in love with curious Alice, the goofy Mad Hatter and especially that clever albeit creepy Cheshire Cat.  So, with that being said, I'm always apprehensive when a re-telling or continuation comes along.  Luckily Splintered does real justice to our Alice.  Howard pays tribute to Carroll's story while at the same time creating her own version.  The mixture of Carrollian nonsense and whimsy mixed with real emotion and depth of character make this the perfect companion to the original tale.  I think Mr. Carroll would be proud.




LIKES:




Wonderfully dark - Howard definitely does not shy away from the unsettling and morbid.  That's part of what makes this such a cool reading experience.  Alyssa, our heroine, is an artist.  Her medium: dead bugs.  This could be considered just gross until you find out that she can speak to bugs.  Just as a little taste here's the first couple of lines of Splintered:
&quot;I've been collecting bugs since I was ten; it's the only way I can stop their whispers. Sticking a pin through the gut of an insect shuts it up pretty quick.&quot;
          And we're off to a running start.  Wow.  Now, I admit that I have an aversion to bugs so I feel no sympathy for them.  Had this been a sentence about puppies I would have shut the book immediately.  However, bugs are fair game and this line is just so raw and full of angst and ick that it sucked me right in.  This darkness follows throughout the whole story.  One of the best parts about this book is Alyssa having to face her own darkness.  It really enhances the story and makes it a lot of fun to read.
I actually like the (sort of) love triangle -  Okay, so I don't know if this can actually be considered a love triangle, but that's probably why I enjoyed it.  Alyssa loves Jeb.  They are obviously meant to be together.  He's sweet, trustworthy, fun and super duper hot, also human.  Then there's Mothra *cough* I mean Morpheus.  Also hot, and snarky, amazing and magical.  But her love for Morpheus seems more platonic.  They have a mutual admiration for one another and an unbreakable bond.  Even if he wants more.  Still, I loved the back and forth between the guys.  It added a lot of humor to the story.
MORPHEUS!!! -  Three things you need to know about this guy: he is the ultimate bad boy, he has an adorable British accent, and he has an insurrection hat.  I'm sold.  The only problem was that I couldn't picture him as he was described.  I adore Once Upon a Time and all I could picture when reading this was Jefferson.  But I'm cool with that.




I mean seriously how can I not?  Good grief.




Plenty of Wonderland for purists - One of the things I was most worried about was how Wonderland would be portrayed.  Would it be recognizable?  Gladly, Splintered is filled with allusions to the original book.  One of the most fun parts of reading this book was finding all of the little Alice Easter eggs hidden inside its pages.  Although all of the characters have been changed in some way, they are still recognizable and Howard ties the stories together brilliantly.




DISLIKES:




Sometimes Alyssa makes me shake my head - Okay so it's not like Alyssa is stupid by any means but some of her decisions can be filed under &quot;things that make me go 'hmm'&quot;.  A great example is when she decides to get a forged passport and fly to England by herself.  Apparently our heroine has never seen Locked Up Abroad.  
Too much explanation of things we should be able to figure out on our own - this is probably the only thing that really bothered me about this book.  Although they were relatively few, there were several instances where the author explained too much about the plot, when it would have been more fun to figure it out on my own.  Luckily this didn't happen too often and it didn't really damage the reading experience.
Even with the couple of flaws that I found I have to give this book five stars.  I was completely captivated by Alyssa, Jeb and all of the netherlings.  Howard has managed to create a new version of Wonderland that is just as exciting, enticing and mad as the original.  I know it may only be January but I would be surprised if this one doesn't end up on my best of 2013 list.  It was just that good.  I can't wait to see what else A.G. Howard does with her writing. I'll certainly be first in line to read her next book."

The descent your mind must make into the world of Auschwitz is torturous and difficult, but the final result is a better understanding of the atrocities carried out by Nazi Germany.

However, one day, in the bookstore with my Wife, I thought I would give it a shot.  This book was in the sale section, later to discover, it is normlly sold in the teen section. Fortunately, I fully enjoyed the book, realizing after I read it, it was part two of a three part series.  I picked up The Warrior Heir (part 1) and then the Dragon Heir (part 3) and loved them all.  These books have really started a huge reading spree for me as within the week, after finishing this three part series, im in to a new series, barely able to put them down, see below under recommendations.  I highly recommend this series if you have a flair for fantasy types and love a good story, its very PG but the Author does a good job of making you not notice.  This series is certainly a good read, especially for young adults."

It is NOTHING like harry potter. Its way better.  Ive read all three. My friend bought the first book and she let me read it. I didnt think it would be all that great but i was very wrong. So of course i had to read the other two. In my opinion the second book was the best. It so suspenseful and had me reading to the very end.  Even a week after i finished i still kept going back to read it. This book is good for people who like teen fantasy/fiction.
"The Wizard Heir (The Heir Chronicles, #2)",1423104870,Cinda Williams Chima,Barnes and Noble,4.4,carlosmock,"This is the second installment in Ms. Chima's ""Heir Chronicles.""

Joseph (Seth) McCauley has spent the last three years getting kicked out of one exclusive private school or another.  

He lands at The Heavens, a private school for the ""difficult"" children.  The Heavens is run by Dr. Gregory Leicester-a wizard himself-who has controlled of fourteen ""alumni""--all of the wizards who have had their wizard stones fused with Dr. Leicester to augment their power.

Dr. Gregory Leicester tries in vain to get Seth to join his stone with him.  Seth is tortured and made miserable until he finds help from another wizard, Jason Haley.  Since Seth is very powerful, but has not been trained, Jason helps him survive the torments by Leicester until Linda Downey, an enchanter gets Seth to Trinity, Ohio, which was made a sanctuary by the last tournament.  

Linda, she discloses to Seth that he is a Weirlind, part part of a society of magical people that comprises sorcerers, wizards, enchanters and warriors.  At their helm sits the feuding houses of the Red Rose-lead by Geoffrey Wylie-and The White Rose, lead by Dr. Jessamine Longbeach.  Everyone has a Weirbook with their ancestry on it but since Seth is an orphan he borrows Jack's to train as a wizard (Jack is part wizard but with a warrior stone).  

Last year-the first Heir book-the control of the Hoards and their guilds have been in disarray.  There was a tournament at Raven's Ghyll and an army of ghosts showed up, the players, Jack Swift and Ellen Stephenson, revolted and the rules were changed in favor of the lesser members of the guild, thus making wizards less powerful.  

Leander Hastings, who was involved with Linda and trained Jack to fight at the Raven's Ghyll,  has called a council.  Hastings wants to preserve the new order, but Claude d'Orsey, the prior head of the guild is plotting with Leicester and his alumni to restore the old order. A second council is called to approve a new constitution and all the players are caled.  It is meant to be a trap to the Hastings group, but Seth, his friends Jason and Madison Moss join forces to save the day.

This book sets the third installment since the constitution was stolen from the council and could be enforced unless someone stops the thief.

Readers will be thrilled with this exceptional second installment of the series.  Chima uses her pen a wand and crafts a rich web of magic.  You'll be taken by her pitch perfect blend of high fantasy and small town reality.  

Better than Harry Potter-Chima brings to life the clash of magic and the ordinary that most authors would need an entire series to create.  She has created an epic battle between good and evil.

Could not put the book down!"
"The Mysterious Island (Extraordinary Voyages, #12)",0812972120,"Jules Verne, Caleb Carr, Jordan Stump",Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"This book captures your attention from the very beginning never releasing until the final mystery is revealed.  This epic classic begins its journey when five Civil War American prisoners are cast onto a far away deserted island in the South Pacific, with nothing but the clothes on their backs and their ingenuity to rely on for survival.  With a mystery that eludes even the sharpest of sleuths  slowly unraveling throughout every chapter, while Jules' amazing vocabulary places you right in the middle of a story line that is exploding with page turning content.  This masterpiece leaves Robinson Cruose, the Swiss Family Robinson, and any other survival stories in the dust.  With an intriguing and mind boggling mystery that eludes the reader throughout the entire story.  It is truly a wonderful adventure to escape to, that I recommend to every reader waiting for a tale that captures one's mind.    Anonymous"

Girl in Hyacinth Blue,014029628X,Susan Vreeland,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"If I die for any reason other than old age, it will be that I have finally decided to rid myself of a world where shallow, unintelligent people write this book off as a 'rip-off' of Tracy Chevalier's 'lovely' Girl With a Pearl Earring.     For the record, I have read both books. I was repulsed by the cold-heartedness of Chevalier's story and the unlikable, un-relatable characters, while I was warmed and touched by the innocence, the complexities, and the intrigue of Vreeland's.      Girl in Hyacinth Blue is a unique, ingenious story. Several stories, actually. Vreeland pulls together the lives of a dozen people from opposite ends of the social, cultural, and economic spectrums. Each character is developed, has his or her own story and ghosts and past, and yet they are all connected by this one painting that is at once mysterious, charming, and beautiful.     This is one of those books you think about long after you finish reading it. It is one of my favorite books, and one I recommend whole-heartedly."
Girl in Hyacinth Blue,014029628X,Susan Vreeland,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"I picked up this book because its about a fictional Vermeer painting. My book group will be reading the Tracy Chevalier book soon, also about a Vermeer painting - Girl with a Pearl Earring. I thought it would be interesting to compare the two books. I am very impressed with the book Ms Vreeland has written.  Everything about it is excellent, the premise for the story, the writing is evocative and draws the reader into each owners story.  The painting is a strong and constant character throughout the book and is a silent witness to the events in the lives of its owners. I have just finished this book, I like so much I'm reading it again immediately."
Girl in Hyacinth Blue,014029628X,Susan Vreeland,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,This is one of the most imaginative books I've ever read.   There was nothing about it that disappointed (except it is too short).  I agree with those who say it is a book that  can be re-read.  I had to send it to my niece since she is a fledgling artist.  She read it quickly and has told me she is re-reading it in reverse.      I found Girl in Hyacinth Blue to be superior to Girl With a Pearl Earring.
Sylvester and the Magic Pebble,067166154X,William Steig,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"I rediscovered this story recently, after seeing it on ""Reading Rainbow.""  As a kid, I was thrilled by the story of Sylvester, a donkey who finds a magic pebble and accidentally wishes that he were a rock.  The story stuck with me all of these years, and I recently read it to my 4 year old daugther.  I will admit, at first reading, she was upset by the story, since Sylvester's parents cannot find him for a long, long time and she just didn't understand why he wasn't turning back into a donkey.  Upon the 2nd reading (and many more after that!) this part of the story became less important, and she now loves it.  We love taking turns thinking of things we would wish for with a magic pebble, and we talk about how important each person of our family is; we are thrilled by Sylvester's reuniuon with his family.  I love being able to pass down a favorite story from my childhood!"

Sylvester is a young donkey who finds a magic pebble and soon finds himself a rock and can't go home.  His parents are sad and everyone in the town looks for Sylvester.  One day many months later, Sylvester's parents go for a picnic near the rock that is Sylvester.  His father finds the magic pebble and places it on the rock while Sylvester is wishing he was a donkey again.  Then, ""poof"" he's a donkey again.This has a good moral to it and young children could learn to be careful what you want or wish for."

Live Wire (Myron Bolitar #10),0525952063,Harlan Coben,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Anonymous,"Okay, seriously. Harlan Coben doesn't set the price, the publishers do. The man worked hard to write the book, and the book critics have already been singing its praises and calling it his best book. Those are big words, considering the success he's had. The rating system is for the book itself, to give prospective customers an idea if it's any good. Don't throw up 1 and 2 star ratings because you think it's too expensive. I agree, the ebook does seem overpriced, but come on, use your heads! I got an advanced copy and must say it was great. Classic Harlan Coben/Myron Bolitar. I'm recommending it to all my friends.

Live Wire (Myron Bolitar #10),0525952063,Harlan Coben,Barnes and Noble,3.8,harstan,"Former tennis star Suzze Tervantino visits MB Reps to ask her agent Myron Bolitar for help.  Eight months pregnant, Suzze is hysterical as her husband rock star husband Lex Ryder, also a client of Myron, has vanished.  She shows Bolitar an entry on Facebook claiming the child she carries is not sired by Ryder.  Although other inline innuendos make the same proclamation, Suzze T swears to Bolitar that Ryder he is the dad (thanks to Maury).

Bolivar has family issues so he feels for his client.  With Windsor ""Win"" Horne Lockwood III at his side, he begins the search for Ryder at a time his father is dying and wants to see his estranged other son Brad.  The inquiry into finding Brad leads Myron to his abandoned sister-in-law Kitty and his fifteen years old nephew Mickey whom he never met.  Neither wants him in their lives.

Live Wire is an exciting investigative thriller in which Bolitar works two family oriented cases.  The insight into his past enhances what long time fans know of his first and second quarters of his life while the Suzze T inquiry forces the agent to look into her family's darkest secrets.  With Win causing havoc, a great late twist, and a powerful look at family, fans will see a different compassionate side to the wise cracking agent.

"The Collectors (Camel Club, #2)",044653109X,David Baldacci,Barnes and Noble,4.2,WyomingReader,"I did not read the first book in the series, Camel Club, and that did not stop me from enjoying this book.  The double plot is nice.  The stories are enough separate and enough connected that it is very entertaining and appropriate to the full story.  Most action thriller books like this often bridge from the unlikely and improbable to the impossible.  Baldacci is able to approach but not cross the line to the impossible.  This makes the book much more satisifying.  The characters seem too human to be immortal.  I was suprised that they all made it through.  The next book in the series, Stone Cold is even better."

"Lord Foul's Bane (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, #1)",0345348656,Stephen R. Donaldson,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"Like other reviewers here, I read all these books when they first came out and have just begun rereading them.  This is not light reading and does require some thought on the part of the reader but the payback is a story of depth and beauty and Thomas Covenant, himself, is a complex, troubled individual. A word on this...there has been some criticism on his behavior early on in this book and, yes, it is impossible to justify. However, remember this is a man who has attuned himself to feel nothing emotionally and, by nature of his disease (leprosy) already feels very little physically due to the destruction of his nerve endings.  He is thrust into a world where ALL feeling and perception is  vivid and painted in the brightest of colors and hues. His reactions are understandable if not justifiable.  I don't want to give too much away but if you are tired of the standard fantasy about handsome/beautiful kings/queens, bad wizard vs good wizard, dragons, dragons and more dragons. Well, try this.  It's depth is amazing."
"Lord Foul's Bane (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, #1)",0345348656,Stephen R. Donaldson,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"This is without doubt the best fantasy story I have ever read. It is complex,has amazing depth and takes readers on a journey that they will never forget. I read the entire series in about three weeks it would have been less but I started slowing down at the end because I didn't want to finish. It was like having to part with old friends that you had been through heaven and hell with. Well done Mr Donaldson for giving the world such a beautiful and complete human story- so dark in places and yet ultimately a brilliantly graceful message. Thanks so much."
"Lord Foul's Bane (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, #1)",0345348656,Stephen R. Donaldson,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"Without a doubt, my all time favorite series of books (The First AND Second Chronicles). I, like a lot of other reviewers, read the books some time ago and am now rereading them. I can't wait to get through them again. I'm now finding all kinds of foreshadowing gems in Lord Foul's Bane that I couldn't have recognized the first time through. Anybody who doesn't like these stories is truly incapable of appreciating Donaldson's sense of imagination and storytelling. I've heard people describe his writing style as 'strangled,' 'dense,' etc., but as a professional writer, I believe that his writing style is necessary for story he tells. Other people have called him a 'Tolkein wanna-be,' and even a 'Dostoyevski wanna-be.' These people know not that they honor him by making these claims. All good authors are inspired by their predecessors, but Donaldson adds his own style and his intense imagination to the genre that is unequalled, I believe, by anyone I've yet read.    I finished reading the chronicals about 8 years ago the first time, and I still think about the characters all the time. Like others, my heart has been riven from my chest by the horrors of the Wounded Land, but I was absolutely spellbound nonetheless! I am still in awe of Nom, the sandgorgon, an utterly fascinating Second-Chronicals hero. Too many others to itemize here.   I still can't believe that anyone who likes fantasy did not absolutely love this series. If you don't believe me, read it...but beware, it isn't Tolkien."
"First, Break All the Rules: What the World's Greatest Managers Do Differently",0684852861,"Marcus Buckingham, Curt Coffman",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"This book is provocative and it challenges conventional wisdom in people management.     Gallup's thorough research presented in this book reveal the 'Four Keys of Great Managers' that should unlock the potential of each and every employee (the '... not' statements represent conventional wisdom according to the authors)     1. When selecting someone, they select for talent ... not simply experience, intelligence, or determination.   2. When setting expectations, they define the right outcomes ... not the right steps.   3. When motivating someone, they focus on strengths ... not on weaknesses.   4. When developing someone, they find him the right fit ... not simply the next rung on the ladder     So great managers don't believe that a person can achieve anything he sets his mind to. They don't try to help a person overcome his weaknesses (instead they devise a support system. Find a complementary partner. Or find an alternative role). They consistently disregard the golden rule - i.e. treat people as you would like to be treated - instead they acknowledge that each employee is unique and thus would demand different things of you, the manager! And they even play favourites (i.e. spend the most time with your best people).     Many of us know by experience that it is hard to manage others well. Continually, you have to balance the competing interests of the employee, the customer, the company, and even yourself. You attend too much to one, and you invariably upset the others.     This book cannot make the manager's role easier. But it certainly provides you with some brilliant insights into effective people management. The book's Four Keys should be inspiring for any people manager, even if you do not accept all of their findings. At least, you'll find yourself challenged as they document their conclusions based on 80,000 interviews.     I have found their twelve questions to measure the strength of a workplace very helpful for regular individual reviews as well:     [What do the employee get?]   1. Do I know what is expected of me at work?   2. Do I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work right?     [What do the employee give?]   3. At work, do I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day?   4. In the last seven days, have I received recognition or praise for good work?   5. Does my supervisor, or someone at work, seem to care about me as a person?   6. Is there someone at work who encourages my development?     [Do the employee belong here?]   7. At work, do my opinions seem to count?   8. Does the mission/purpose of my company make me feel like my work is important?   9. Are my co-workers committed to doing quality work?   10. Do I have a best friend at work?     [How can we all grow?]   11. In the last six months, have I talked with someone about my progress?   12. At work, have I had opportunities to learn and grow?'     I liked the book so much that I also bought the audio CD, which is enthusiastically read by Cunningham with a British accent.     At last, one of my favourite quotes from this book:     People don't change that much.   Don't waste time trying to put in what was left out.   Try to draw out what was left in.   That's hard enough.     Peter Leerskov,   MSc in International Business (Marketing & Management) and Graduate Diploma in E-business"
"First, Break All the Rules: What the World's Greatest Managers Do Differently",0684852861,"Marcus Buckingham, Curt Coffman",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"Overall, the book is a pretty good read.  Among other things, I especially enjoyed the discussion about focusing on the strengths of employees and finding the right fit for them.  An employee who is mediocre at one job function can excel in another position.  This is something that very few other management books discuss even though it is an extremely important principle.    I did have a problem with a few things the authors said.  I personally don¿t believe that good managers consistently violate the golden rule.  This gives readers the impression that good managers don¿t care about treating people well and I don¿t think that¿s true.    Also, the authors recommend that managers should spend most of their time with good employees since they are the ones who are getting things done.  Although I understand the point they are trying to make, they never said that unproductive behavior should be confronted.  It¿s almost as if they are suggesting that poor employees should be ignored.  If an employee always shows up late, makes mistakes, and doesn¿t work well with others, is ignoring the problem the best thing to do?  I believe that the best managers tactfully confront the behavior, give the employee a fair chance to improve, and then replace them with a much better employee if things don¿t change.    In addition, the section on ¿The Art of Interviewing for Talent¿ is bothersome.  A list of ¿good interview questions¿ always has to be taken with a huge grain of salt.  The reason is simple: people can lie.  Anybody who has done a lot of interviews knows that there are people who can say all the right things in an interview and still end up being a dud.  Please keep this in mind!    Aside from these issues, the book is very solid.  I¿d recommend checking it out.    Greg Blencoe  Author, The Ten Commandments for Managers"

Our Town,0060512636,"Thornton Wilder, Donald Margulies, Tappan Wilder",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"My English 10 class recently reed the three act skit Out Town. I enjoyed reading it very much but I certainly started of slow. The first to acts very humorous at times but as the stage manager said the first two acts are on life and sadly the last is not George and Emily¿s marriage but death. i liked it mainly because it reminds me to slow down as much as possible and enjoy life, my family, and people around me. when ever i am fighting with someone i think about Our Town and then i realize what i think is important now, wont be so important later."
Our Town,0060512636,"Thornton Wilder, Donald Margulies, Tappan Wilder",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guacamole,"As a play dedicated to recognizing the beauty of simplicity and reiterating the old adage ""take nothing for granted,"" Our Town epitomizes a pure appreciation for life. Without any props, the play stresses the innate elegance of life that requires no enhancement. Free from unnecessary decoration, the stage setting forces one to recognize the profound message of the play and eliminates the frivolous features that distract from that ultimate lesson. 
	Thornton Wilder effectively uses characterization to develop the theme of recognizing and appreciating one's blessings in life. Emily, as the main character of the play, undergoes a defining realization that life's beauty is too magnificent for living people to comprehend. Her journey back to her twelfth birthday opens her eyes to the transience of life and her inability to relive moments of true happiness. Initially described as a na&#239;ve character whose understanding of life consisted of her personal longings, Emily returns from her trip wiser and more resigned. This shift in mentality-the drastic change from blissful ignorance to burdensome awareness-stresses the importance of appreciating blessings before they are gone.  
	Contrasting the ideal atmosphere of Grover's Corner, the minor character of Simon Stimson is a misfit in the town's carefree feel. Infamous as the town alcoholic and choir director, Simon Stimson maintains a cynical attitude about life, as best reflected in his defining speech. Equating life to ignorance and blindness, he expresses unexplained bitterness that ultimately culminated in his suicide. While Wilder succeeds in highlighting the need to appreciate life through Simon Stimson's shortcoming, he fails to develop the character to one that is real and believable. In neglecting to address the source of Simon's bitterness, Wilder does not achieve the full potential of such a character. 
	The play has an overall effect that cannot be defined by any one stylistic element. Diction alone does not stand out, and neither does syntax. Imagery is almost nonexistent, as the stage consists of no more than tables, chairs, and actors. Nevertheless, the combination of various factors distinguishes this play as a noteworthy read, the most impressive aspect of which is its rare simplicity."
Our Town,0060512636,"Thornton Wilder, Donald Margulies, Tappan Wilder",Barnes and Noble,4.2,TMElls,"Our Town, a play written by Thornton Wilder, is a story that, for awhile, may seem to drag on and be slightly dull, but, at the same time, captures the attention of the reader/viewer and provides an insightful and unique view about humanity. The three-act play is about a little town that is very quiet, includes a small population, and focuses on the two families, the Webbs and the Gibbses. These two families show very important aspects of human life: daily life, love and marriage, and death.
	The acts are fairly uneventful, which may cause the reader/viewer to be bored. However, this is more true to life, because human lives mainly consist of the uneventful, simple occurrences. This makes the play more relatable to the readers/viewers, as any well written story should be, so that its themes have more impact. Even though the setting and time period of the play may be argued as hard to relate to, the characters and plot are realistic and the small town only allows for greater emphasis on the theme. One of the most important themes in the story is not to take the everyday interactions with one another for granted, for those are most important. To emphasize that people can take each other for granted and not notice one another in a slow-paced, quiet town in which everyone knows and cares about one another has greater impact because it limits the excuse of being busy and having too much to do. The play presents this theme near the end of the story when Emily Gibbs, in her afterlife, reviews her twelfth birthday and is disappointed to find that she cannot look at anyone for a long enough period of time, because her twelve-year-old self had not taken the time to think about what was happening and appreciate the everyday interactions she was having with her family and friends. This theme makes the play an excellent piece of literature, because it presents a very important lesson that everyone must learn.	
	Therefore, even though Our Town is slow paced and may even seem somewhat dull and boring in the beginning, it presents an important message that pertains to almost everyone who reads/views this story. Everyone could take time to appreciate someone or something more than they do, and that message makes this play an effective work of art."

Harry Bosch has returned from retirement and is now working in the Open Unsolved Unit. The book opens with Harry working on a case that involves the murder of a young beautiful girl. Harry still remains a believable character. He has his flaws but overall he is a pretty decent fellow. In other words he's the same old Harry that I have always enjoyed reading about. Echo Park continues Harry's journey into the dark side of men and once again he gets knocked around, but his persistence keeps him faithfully at doing his job. 
In summary, I give Echo Park a enthusiastic endorsement."

The Winner,0446522597,David Baldacci,Barnes and Noble,4.1,ChadAaronSayban,"David Baldacci proved his mastery of the modern thriller with Absolute Power and Total Control.  The Winner was released in 1998 and looked to continue the Baldacci brand of storytelling. Destitute waitress LuAnn Tyler lives a ramshackle existence with her newborn daughter in a poverty stricken southern town.  At least that's the case until she is approach by a man named Jackson who promises her the unthinkable - a certain win in the national lottery of $100 million dollars.  Her conscience tells her to say no, but before she can, events conspire to make Jackson's offer the only hope for LuAnn and her daughter.  At the time, Jackson's conditions are acceptable, but ten years later, LuAnn decides to defy those conditions to take back her life with the hopes that the seemingly invincible puppet-master Jackson will be none the wiser.  

The Winner drags a bit early on as it tries to flesh out every thought of every character, but once the action gets going, it is intense and fun.  You will root for LuAnn, but just like her, you won't always know who is on her side.  Baldacci is at his best when he is putting his characters in deadly situations where they don't know where the trouble is coming from and they need to find that one hole to squeeze through to safety - and The Winner offers that up more than once.  The story could have been a bit tighter and there were moments where the plot stretched believability to the edge.  However, this is frankly when Baldacci is at his best.  Baldacci's stories are like McDonald's Big Macs - you know they aren't fine dining, but you love them for what they are.  All in all, Baldacci provides exactly what should be expected from his novels - a thrill-ride of a story that keeps the pages turning."

"Ark Angel (Alex Rider, #6)",0142407380,Anthony Horowitz,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Dragonflyer257,"You don't have to love James Bond, space travel, or tropical islands to love this book.  Ark Angel is another twisty ride through the amazing life of Alex Rider, fourteen year old turned spy.  Alex finds himself again mixed up in everything absolutely evil when he wakes in the hospital after being shot.  Told to go and recouperate with an extremely rich man and his son, Alex finds that some friends can be your foes.  Alex travels to many places during this book and boy does he travel fast.  You will not be able to put this book down once you start it because every paragrah ends in another twist in the plot.  I recommend reading this awesome book if you love a book that never gets slow and always leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat begging for more."
"Ark Angel (Alex Rider, #6)",0142407380,Anthony Horowitz,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"This book started out with a security conference where a reporter mentions the threat of a terrorist group called force three. Meanwhile, Alex Rider was in a top secret hospital recovering from a serious injury. He wanted to give up his life as a spy but that was far from happing as four men came into the hospital wanting to find Paul Drevin. Alex saves Paul and learns that he is son of Nikolei Drevin, an eccentric billionaire. Nikolei is an enemy of force three because he is a threat to the environment. Alex goes to stay at Nikolei¿s house and learns that he is extremely competitive. Alex talks to some former CIA agents and is brought up to the speed with the fact that Drevin is a dreadful man. Drevin is aware that Alex knows everything so he locks Alex in a hangar and explains everything to him. He wanted to crash Ark Angel, his space hotel, into the pentagon so his criminal files would be destroyed. However, Drevin was killed in a plane crash so Alex did not have to deal with him anymore, but the difficult part was yet to come. Alex went to Ark Angel to move the bomb on the hotel so that the explosion would cause no harm. Alex was able to best Kaspar, the leader of force three, and return successfully and safely back to earth.
	The theme of this book was probably: those with evil intentions will always be trampled by those with good intentions.
	I really enjoyed this book because it was a real page turner. This book could not easily be set down. Each page brought the appearance of a new twist in the plot. It was also cleverly written because sometimes those with the worst intentions seemed like the best people. I also liked how Horowitz made the book short but still packed with action He did well on not lingering too much on details. 
	The only dislikes I had with this book were the lack of flaws of the main character. He was able to escape from the hardest situations and was always perfect. This book is not read for reality but still, it would have been nice if the main character was not perfect. 
	You should definitely read this book because it is so interesting, you feel as if you are not even reading. It is very well written and if you are into action packed novels, this one is a must."

Saint Anything,0451474708,Sarah Dessen,Barnes and Noble,4.5,kthusker,"Sydney feels invisible.... Her bother had always had all the attention - the golden boy. Even now, in prison for driving drunk and hitting a teen riding his bike home at 2 AM, Peyton is still the center of his Mom's world. She focuses tirelessly on efforts to aid him in prison and push blame away from him. Sydney is lonely and even though she has some good friends at a exclusive private schools, when money gets tight, she decides she is going to transfer to local public school. It is here that she meets Layla and her family and her life is forever changed. Layla is anything but invisible, and she refused to let Sydney remain in the shadows. For her part, Sydney grows to love this girl and her family and she feels a connection there that is missing at home. She is not invisible when she is with Layla, Mac and the rest of the Chatham family, but she still wishes that she could connect with her parents, that for once, they would pay attention to her. When the tide turns, however, and her mom does start to pay attention, it's not at all for the reasons or in the way that Sydney had hoped.

This book has many moving pieces: great characters, intersecting plot lines and a myriad of themes. Teens will love this book. It has the expected Dessen romance thread, but this book is so much more than that. It's about acceptance, family, friendship, finding your voice and your place in the world. As the story progresses, Sydney develops a really good sense of self and sense of others.  As a teacher, this was nice to see in a teen character."
Saint Anything,0451474708,Sarah Dessen,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Goldenfurproductions,"MY THOUGHTS 
I've read almost every Sarah Dessen book and this one has to be one of my favorites! It was absolutely beautiful!

Sydney has always felt like she was in her older brother's shadow, but for the past few years her brother has been in and out of holding cells and escorted home by officers. Then her brother drives drunk and hits a teenager on a bike, paralyzing him for life. Now Sydney is known as the girl with the brother in jail. Sydney decides to move to a new school, away from the whispers, and ends up becoming friends with a girl, Layla, whose family works in a pizza shop. She gets introduced to Layla's brother and Layla's friends and Sydney begins to feel happy again. But her parents are too preoccupied to notice anything but Sydney's brother. 

What I love so much about this book is how much depth is within it. This book has the usual coming of age tale that I expect from Sarah Dessen, but there's so much more to it. It has a strong aspect of family. Sydney's parents, especially her mom, become very controlling of Sydney in this book, as if she is her brother. They also see Peyton, Sydney's brother, as a victim and even act as if Peyton is away at school, not in jail. It is very infuriating the way they treat Sydney, but it's very realistic.

Sydney begins to live outside her brother's shadow. She's at a school where no one knows her brother's past and she has friends that like hanging out with her. It's hard for Sydney to have a life like this because of her parents who always seemed like they liked Peyton more, especially now. We really get into Sydney's life and point of view. Her character is very realistic! She has her flaws, but she's the girl that will always do the right thing and will always be there for her friends. Something her parents can't see. It's very beautiful, though, seeing Sydney change and grow throughout this book!

There is a romance, but this isn't a romance book. There is so much more to this book!

IN CONCLUSION 
I love this book so much! I was so engrossed in this book! It was absolutely beautiful and it was amazing seeing Sydney and her growth! Really, I recommend this book for everyone!"

The Twelve Tribes of Hattie,0385350287,Ayana Mathis,Barnes and Noble,3.6,VirtuousV,"Life is not always what you expect.  When you make choices whether to choose one thing or one person over another you belief that you've made the right choice.  The Twelve Tribes of Hattie is about sexuality, adultery, life, consequences, circumstances and choices.  In 1923, Hattie Shepherd, was just fifteen years old, when she made the decision to leave Georgia for a better life in Philadelphia to start a family and become a wife. Her life was hard, challenging and the decisions she made were based upon her in-experiences of life.  These challenges, as seen through the eyes of her children, caused them tremendous stress, dysfunction and unforgiveness throughout their adulthood. Her children did not fully understand that she too was young and inexperienced to make these types of decisions but Hattie did not fully understand that her inexperience decisions would cause indecisiveness in the development of her children.  A decision that Hattie made came back to haunt her years later through the decision of her daughter.  Ayana Mathis takes us on a journey to generational curses and how they can greatly affect the future."
The Taking,0553584502,Dean Koontz,Barnes and Noble,3.8,pandacheri,"I picked up The Taking because the synopsis intrigued me.  As I started reading, I thought, ""OK.  This is horror.""  As I continued and the plot developed, I thought, ""No, this is science fiction.""  By the end of the book, I decided it was something entirely different, and that it really doesn't fit just one genre.  I then demanded my husband read it so we could discuss it.  He did, and we had wonderful conversations as he progressed through the book.

As a result of reading The Taking, I began a quest to read as much of Dean Koontz as I can get my hands on.  At last count, I think I'm up to 47 books.  I have a long way to go, and as prolific a writer as he is, I may never catch up.  That is a marvelous problem to have.

Read this book if you are on a spiritual journey.  Share this book to discuss it with friends.  It could change the way you view life."
The Taking,0553584502,Dean Koontz,Barnes and Noble,3.8,tattooedmommie,"When I first started this book, I wasn't sure if I'd really enjoy it as much as I enjoy all of Koontz's others. I've never been one to really enjoy an alien invasion themed plot, but I have to admit that I was hooked into the story almost immediately. Leave it to Koontz to make me want to read a story about a topic I usually avoid.
By the last page, which I reached in record time, I put the book down and had a hearty laugh because my perception of the whole story felt askew. This review may be a little confusing, but once you've read the book you'll understand why. I was so surprised at the ending that frankly, I wanted to read the book again just to put the puzzle pieces together a little earlier.
As with most of Koontz's work, I can't recommend this enough!"

"If There Be Thorns (Dollanganger, #3)",0671729454,V.C. Andrews,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Caroline Yount,"This is a great, but slightly creepy book. In If There Be Thorns, Christopher and Cathy have two yoing boys. Bart, the younger of the two has Riley's Day Sydrome, the inability to feel pain. This story revolves around Bart, the veiled lady, and Bart's brother (I forgot his name) and his sweetheart Melody.  While the house is being built, the boys are fascinated as to who would build a big house next to theirs, in the middle of nowhere. While the boys are watching the house being built Kathy is teaching her dance class and Christopher is at his hospital, as he became a doctor. Kathy's favorite student dies in a car crash, but before she did she gave her two year old daughter to Kathy, thus creating a new addition to the family. When the lady and her butler move in next door, things start to go awry. The lady spoils Bart, while the butler gives him a journal and the 'secrets to great sucsess.' Bart starts to pretend he is someone named Malcolm and is being cruel, with a hint of madness. Who are the people next door? Why is Bart pretending to be Malcolm? As the secrets of the past are revealed, will the Dollanganger's rise to the challenge? Be prepare for this novel in the series, as it brings death, hidden answers, people of the past, heart break, life saving, realization, and who everyone says they are and who they will become. This installment is written in the two boy's points of view. Bart carries the drama and anger, while his brother has the romance and protectivess. Will the family be torn apart by the Foxworth Hall curse? Or will love override it. The flowers have blossomed and now their seeds have too, but what do you do if the blossomed flower has thorns? V.C Andrews brings her best, so get ready and watch the flowers petals fall or blossom. Read on, to find out."
"If There Be Thorns (Dollanganger, #3)",0671729454,V.C. Andrews,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"Unlike the book prior to this one, the editing was much better! Gone were the typo's and the utter mess of the editing that I barely made it though reading it.

This book however, was filled with such anguish that like another commenter, I had to set the book aside to take it all end. I couldn't handle the animal cruelty as well. Fortunately, it was brief, but still left me unsettled. 

Bart clearly has been affected by the truth of his parentage and you can clearly see the life changing damage it does to him. Jory, who is the exact opposite of Bart, had enough of Paul's and Christopher's optimistic view on life, to allow him to grow up with those influences. Older than Bart, I think that Jory's first 4 years of life without a sibling, helped him to gain the self confidence that Bart so sadly lacks. 

I would recommend this book, if you have already read the first two. It is crucial to the entire series. Clearly this book, as well as the other's in this series is not for young minds/readers. If you do allow your teenager to read it, be prepared to answer any questions openly and honesyly, as this whole series leaves very little to the imagination. 

Incest, animal cruelty, sexual content, murder and revenge may not be some subjects you would want your pre-teen to read. Nothing in these books are sugar coated. 

A hard read, but definitely a good read. I am subtracting a star for the animal abuse and cruelty.

Owl Moon,0399214577,"Jane Yolen, John Schoenherr",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"A girl and her father go owling on a moonlit winter night near the farm where they live. Bundled tight in wool clothes, they trudge through snow 'whiter than the milk in a cereal bowl'  here and there, hidden in ink-blue shadows, a fox, raccoon, field mouse and deer watch them pass. An air of expectancy builds as Pa imitates the Great Horned Owl's call once without answer, then again. From out of the darkness 'an echo/ came threading its way/ through the trees.' Schoenherr's watercolor washes depict a New England few readers see: the bold stare of a nocturnal owl, a bird's-eye view of a farmhouse. In harmony with the art, the melodious text brings to life an unusual countryside adventure. John Schoenherr's illustrations help bring richness to the countryside adventure."

The Gambler,0812966937,"Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Constance Garnett, Gary Saul Morson",Barnes and Noble,3.8,hemlokgang on LibraryThing,"Passe, manque, noir, rouge.......words which can destroy a life!  Dostoevsky's novella, based on his personal experience, portrays the destructive force of gambling.   The tutor, the wealthy grandmother, the ingenue.....each is ruined in the course of this story, while surrounded by observers and others who make their way in life by latching on to the winners and dumping the losers.  Powerful psychological insight lends great depth to this story of being human, of being Russian, and of being vulnerable to risk-taking in love and in finance!  Great read!"
The Gambler,0812966937,"Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Constance Garnett, Gary Saul Morson",Barnes and Noble,3.8,mewilbur on LibraryThing,"Believe it or not, Dostoevsky wrote a short novel. It isn't his best. He left a couple of probable plot devices hanging, But then he wrote it in a month (with the help of a stenographer, who became his wife) on a bet. So it's a good novel about obsessive gambling, a problem which Dostoevsky knew all too much  about. The protagonist, who tutors the two young children of a very odd family of obsessives and is obsessed with his employer's adult step-daughter, adds obsessive gambling to his list of quirks. The result is a story that isn't only sad; sometimes it's hilarious."

"Frost Burned (Mercy Thompson, #7)",0441020011,Patricia Briggs,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Book_Monster_Reviews,"This is the seventh book in the Mercedes Thompson series and to be honest, I was a little hesitant to start it. Mainly because I didn't enjoy River Marked as much as the rest and I was scared that the series was starting to lose that special something that hooked me in book 1 and made me fall in love with this world that Patricia created. Thankfully my fears were unfounded and Patricia Briggs has proved to me why she deserves to be on my auto-buy author list.
Mercy is not your typical heroine, she's not as bad-ass as most yet she's not a feminine girly girl either, she's somewhere in-between. A mechanic by trade and a Walker by birth, with the ability to shapeshift into a Coyote. The extent of her powers is, as yet, unknown although being raised by werewolves has given her an edge and insight that has helped her a lot.

Throughout the series we have watched Mercy face seemingly insurmountable odds only for her to come out battered, bruised and occasionally bloody but on top. She has grow as a character and we finally saw her marry and settle down but with Mercy's luck you know it's not going to be as simple as living happily ever after. While on a shopping trip with her step-daughter her husband and their pack are kidnapped, on the run desperate to hunt down those who will do her family harm while protecting those who remain, the odds are once again firmly stacked against her. Trusting in allies old and new Mercy must stay strong if she wants to save those she loves.
What follows had me on the edge of my seat,my nails are a mess and I could swear my heart almost stopped at one point. It was an action packed journey that once again enthralled me from start to finish and I can't wait to see where the journey takes us next."
"Frost Burned (Mercy Thompson, #7)",0441020011,Patricia Briggs,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"Read this in practically one sitting! I've been a fan of the Mercy Thompson series and Patricia Briggs since the very first installment, Moon Called. 
What I love the best about this book is not just the suspense, the action, or the excellent and smart writing. It's the characters. I laugh and cry with them. 
I feel their pain and triumphs both. Mercy never knows how to stay out of trouble, and I love her for that!

The only thing I would point out is that this story felt longer than the previous ones. I'm not complaining on that front. I want more from Briggs. Please hurry with the next installment!"

Père Goriot,039397166X,Honoré de Balzac,Barnes and Noble,4,theaelizabet on LibraryThing,"Balzac wrote this book (published in 1835) as part of a sequence of books and plays known as La Comedie humaine. Through the strivings of a young student named Rastignac, Balzac tells of an 1819 Paris, where the social order is up ended, poverty is rife and residents will do anything to climb up, through and over the social ladder. Emile Zola (who came a couple generations after Balzac) wrote, in an essay published in the Norton Critical Edition, ¿He killed off the lies of the old genres and inaugurated the future . . . Balzac . . . grows stronger every day and presides over a literary movement that will certainly be that of the twentieth century.¿ Remembering Balzac¿s importance in literary history may help one continue reading Pere Goriot, despite  a desire to throttle every selfish character in the book."
Père Goriot,039397166X,Honoré de Balzac,Barnes and Noble,4,LukeS on LibraryThing,"This classic piece was my introduction to Balzac. This canny Frenchman is a close and knowing observer of human nature. The hopes, desperation, greed, and cynicism so rampant every day in our world, are fully on display here.The tale is told through the viewpoint of Rastignac, a 21 year-old law student and newcomer to Paris. Rastignac's ambition are the common ones, to be rich, fashionable, and carefree, and wishes to take a mistress. These ambitions shift over the course of the story. He becomes enamored of Pere Goriot, understanding what a virtuous man he is. Balzac shows is the destructiveness of 19th-century Paris society: Goriot's two worldly daughters waste his means over time and leave him impoverished. Goriot himself, however, is as much a supporter of worldly amibitions as anyone, but it bankrupts him and at length, at least indirectly, kills him.Here is post-Napoleon Paris, described closely if not lovingly by Balzac. This author's fame as a canny observer of human nature and human folly is richly deserved. If you haven't yet taken up Balzac, this is an outstanding place to start. Go for it!"
Père Goriot,039397166X,Honoré de Balzac,Barnes and Noble,4,Stbalbach on LibraryThing,"Balzac, a French author, was the father of the literary genre ""realism"". As he says in the opening pages ""..this drama is not fictional, it's not a novel: All is true--so true you will be able to recognize everything that goes into it in your own life"". Of course, it is fiction, ""Pere Goriot"" is one of over 90 novels Balzec wrote in a frantic 20-year writing career that detail aspects of social and private life in France in the 1820s and 1830s, part of an integrated work called ""The Human Comedy"". ""Pere Goriot"" is considered representative of Balzac at the height of his abilities and is one of his most widely read novels.Having never (consciously) read a ""realist"" novel, I knew what to expect after the first 20 pages were devoted to describing every last detail of a Parisian bording house. Far from boring, it was like a history or anthropology book come alive in full color, sound and taste. Balzacs powers of observation are so penetrating, not just of objects but of the human heart and mind, that it is no wonder historians have used his work as a basis for understanding France during that time period. Oscar Wilde said of Balzac ""The Nineteenth-Century, as we know it, is largely an invention of Balzac's"".There are a number of translations available, I started with the free Gutenburg translation from the 19th century and gave up one-quarter through as too many passages were undecipherable. The Raffel translation (Norton Critical Edition), critically acclaimed, is pure magic; re-reading the same sections brought forth an entirely new book, it was amazing to see the difference translators have on the novel."

Everyone else who has reviewed it felt the drama and the suspense of this character driven novel, but I didn't.  I read it to the end, but will not pick up Jo Nesbo's next book."

The story never became interesting, and the writing was equally dull, at times nonsensical. A couple scenes left me wondering if years had passed or a few hours. A dog lunges at a man's throat but bites him on the neck instead. What does that even mean? I suspect the translation is at fault, but I wish I hadn't purchased this."
"Night Play (Dark-Hunter #5, Were-Hunter #1)",0312992424,Sherrilyn Kenyon,Barnes and Noble,4.6,3monstersmom,"Welcome to some grade A book crack!! Really, there isn't much more to say about this book. I devoured it in a few sweet hours and was ready to hop onto the next hunky piece of man meat in the dark hunter series. This whole series is nothing more than simple book crack and I love it! Every book in this series, so far, has held onto the same basic plot line - hunky tortured male falls in love with insecure woman. Can she love him back? Is he worthy? Is she worthy? How will their love survive? What the hell is up with the sexy piece of flesh named Acheron? See, it's the same thing over and over again, but man does it make for some great relaxing reading.
 
What's different about Night Play - not much. OK, so the lead male character Vane isn't a Dark-Hunter, but he is a Were-Hunter Wolf. No matter what Vane is in the story, these guys are all the same, usually immortal hunks with a tortured past that are amazed to fine themselves drawn to these modern day women. The best change in this book is the plus sized heroine, Bride. It was a nice change compared to having believe that Barbie doesn't have a love life and needs a hunky man to help repair her self-esteem, pleeease. Give me a story about a real woman any day, and all the more better that she gets to play sex kitten with the hot love stallion. 

You almost can't go wrong with this series. Yes, some books are way better than others. No, the reading isn't strenuous or thought provoking. Yes, the series should be read in order, but you could probably manage just fine picking up any of them and reading it solely. My recommendation: Pick up the book, get into your favorite reading spot, grab some coffee, and relax with some simple reading. You won't regret the series."

Too Big to Fail: The Inside Story of How Wall Street and Washington Fought to Save the Financial System from Crisis — and Themselves,0670021253,Andrew Ross Sorkin,Barnes and Noble,3.8,PodcastSteve,"Andrew Ross Sorkin's book is a good overview of the recent financial crisis, much as Bryan Burroughs' ""Barbarians at the Gates"" succeeded at capturing the deal-making insanity of the RJR Nabisco buyout two decades ago. 

The book is a little superficial in its reliance on a few key participants for most of the narrative and anecdotes. 

I worked in the bond rating industry for nearly 10 years, and I was surprised that Sorkin didn't explain why there's no input in the book from any people from that industry. It would have helped explain the critical role the rating agencies play in the overall operation of the financial industry, particularly the structured financings that played such a big role in this crisis.

I suspect it was hard to get people to speak on the record when lawsuits still haven't all been completely filed, but it would have been nice if Sorkin had tried to get more detailed explanations from the people most responsible for the dilemma, people structuring and rating the mortgage-backed securities that helped cause the fall of Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns. 

It also would have been helpful if he had been able to get some insurance industry experts to give him more insight into how AIG got itself into the business of insuring credit default risks that sank the company even while its primary business of traditional insurance lines remained solid and profitable.

The publisher must have been rushing to get the book out, because, to my surprise, there were a number of proofreading failures in the book, including misspellings and grammar errors that should have been caught. There was even a page where the same sentence, in slightly different form, appeared twice in a row. 

Despite these shortcomings, I found the book an interesting read on a complicated subject, and since Sorkin clearly had unprecedented access to people like the Treasury secretary and the head of Goldman Sachs, it's almost certain to be regarded as the most authoritative account of what these people experiencedm at least until and unless they write their own memoirs."
Too Big to Fail: The Inside Story of How Wall Street and Washington Fought to Save the Financial System from Crisis — and Themselves,0670021253,Andrew Ross Sorkin,Barnes and Noble,3.8,My_Last_Clancy,"I feel the author is very soft on the executives of the very companies who brought about the financial crises of 2008 - 2009.  He never goes into any of the root causes - the various accounting and packaging practices of bad loans, why the mortgages were issued to people who were obviously incapable or unwilling to repay the loans.  Ne never addresses the deceptive practices of mortgage companies.  

There is a lot of quoted conversations, leading me to believe that he fictionalized actual conversations; he repeatedly states what various executives ""believe"" but it seems that is HIS, the author's, projecting his own empathy into the story.

It is a good chronology of events for a limited period of time.  It does make interesting reading, albeit you may develop undue sympathy for the executives paid many tens of millions of dollars a year as you read about their psychological stresses at the possibility of their greed-driven efforts crashing down about them.

I expected more hard facts about the crisis from a journalist of Sorkin's stature.  I do recommend reading it, though. It is easy reading, although you will have to remember many different names (but he helps with that) and what banks they are associated with.  But to get a good understanding of the crisis, you need to read something else."

Magic Hour,0345467531,Kristin Hannah,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"I am a long time fan of Kristin Hannah's.  I've read everything she's written and unlike some multi-published authors, Hannah just gets better and better with each book she writes. And MAGIC HOUR is no exception. The title says it all---this book is pure MAGIC!! I don't like to read reviews that give away the plot and so I'm not going to comment on that except to say that this story blew me away.  It was everything I'd come to expect (and love) from a Hannah novel--true emotion, deep characters--but it was also a story line so unique and fresh, I could not put the book down.

I could now say I would have paid full price for it if I had to. It is outstanding. One of my new favorite books. I spent an entire rainy Saturday reading this book and am glad I did. I could not stop reading. This book has everything  Drama, family,heartbreak, friendships(old and new), and a little bit of romance mixed in. I felt like I knew these characters so well and the way the author describes the area they live in you feel like you have really visited there while reading this book. I was sad it was over.

The Winter of Our Discontent,0143039482,"John Steinbeck, Susan Shillinglaw",Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"Ethan Allen Hawley...     Sometimes a character comes along that rings out in your head. He's so identifiable that you almost assume the character was modelled after your own soul. Never mind the fact that the character was created 10 years before you were born, he's you... or maybe you're him.    These characters are so real that you forget that the author is the one narrating the story. The author is transparent. The narrator is your own heart, a characterization of yourself. His narration is raw and truthful. The prose may be nearly 50 years old, but it paints a portrait of American life that transcends all the days from this to that.    That's Steinbeck's prose. Steinbeck's prose, but Ethan Hawley's words. Ethan is the lead character in Steinbeck's, 'The Winter of Our Discontent.' Ethan is Steinbeck's creation, Ethan is my character. I listen to his thoughts, to the ideas in his head and I recognize them as the thoughts I so often find myself working through. His struggles, his emotions and, indeed, his proposed solutions are a facsimile of the very ones I carry with me. Every man must consider his fate. In your heart, you find your answers, however right or wrong. Ethan found my answers... not that I'm gonna start robbing banks or anything. But, sitting in the Place, out of the wind, seeing under the guardian lights, I find the answers that Ethan found so long before I knew I was looking.

"Absalom, Absalom!",0679732187,William Faulkner,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"Review Summary: Absalom, Absalom! is a book that you can easily underestimate. Your persistence will be rewarded with pleasure if you are patient, and assume that something magnificent will appear that is different from what you expect. The story is a cross between a Greek tragedy, King Lear, and the oral tradition of story-telling. As such, it strikes the deepest chords of human connection and ambition. The primary settings are Mississippi and the West Indies from the Antebellum period through Reconstruction and into the early 20th century. The themes touch deeply on Southern tradition, slavery, and social class. This is a challenging book to read, and will appeal primarily to those who like difficult books that are full of allusions. For most, having read other Faulkner novels will make this one easier to access and understand. As I Lay Dying is a good precursor for this novel.   Reader Caution: A six-letter word beginning with 'n' to describe people of Afro-American descent is used frequently in this book in ways that will offend many people. The use of the word is consistent with the beliefs and the historical moment of the characters who utter it, and does not reflect racist beliefs by the author.    Review: Absalom, Absalom! is certainly one of America's greatest tragic novels. Thomas Sutpen arrives in Jefferson, Mississippi in middle age with a burning desire to establish a magnificent plantation and a dynasty with a leading role in society. To accomplish this, all he has available is his passion, a French architect, some slaves from Haiti, and a huge tract of land that he has somehow swindled out of the Native Americans. From the mud, his dream rises. But his very determination to accomplish his dream causes counterforces to rise that drag his dream into the mud again.     The story is told in a most unusual fashion. Almost every major character's perspective is captured through the device of recounting prior conversations with other major characters. Most of the characters are missing major elements of the 'why' of the story, so you need to keep adding the stories together to begin to understand what was happening beneath the surface. The book eventually relies on a conversation with a nonparticipant in the events to explore why they might have occurred, where no direct evidence is available. In this last regard, the book takes on a little of the mystery-solving tradition involving logic that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle used with Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. This conversation-reporting story-telling device makes the book both remarkably recursive and potentially maddening. If you are like me, you will wonder at times what else could possibly be covered in the book. And then, Faulkner pulls new dimensions to his story out of the hat.     Faulkner's point is that we can almost always know 'what' has happened in terms of major events, but without great investigation and thought we unlikely to ever understand the 'why.' You come to appreciate this point by seeing your understanding of Sutpen's life change as you learn more about him and the events that preceded his arrival in Jefferson. I ultimately came away intrigued and inspired by the book's structure. You could easily have the opposite reaction.    The book is a rich source of concepts and observations about the contradictions inherent in slavery and Southern notions of gentle behavior during the 18th and 19th centuries. You only find these contradictions as well laid out in Thomas Jefferson's writings and biographies.     After you read this book, you should be in a good position to ask yourself some basic questions about what you are trying to accomplish with your personal life and your work. Are your goals any more worthy than Sutpen's? What dangers are you exposed to as a result of having this focus? In what ways are you an innocent in your pursuits?     In seeking respect and esteem, remember to give it to others even more generously!    Donald Mitchell, co-auth"
"Absalom, Absalom!",0679732187,William Faulkner,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"Thomas Sutpen when he is fourteen years old knocks on the front door of a mansion and is told to go to the back door. He and his family are poor and just down from the mountains, the many class distinctions of southern plantation society stun him. He forms a life design that he will aquire all that southern plantation owners have, slaves, riches, mansion, wife, respectability, and sons. The sons thwart his design.   Rosa Coldfield is the second daughter of Goodhue Coldfield and much younger sister to Ellen, born in Jefferson Mississippi. Her mother died in childbirth. Rosa's sister marries Sutpen and when Ellen dies in January 1863, Rosa agrees to take care of her daughter, Judith, who is four years her senior. Following the death of her father in 1864, who had nailed himself up in the attic to avoid having anything to do with the war, she goes in 1865 to Sutpen's Hundred to live with her niece. During the war Rosa, Judith, and Judith's half sister Clytie form a female cabal at Sutpen's Hundred and in an apathy that is almost peace wait in the house like three nuns wedded to the idea of Thomas Sutpen's return. When he does return Rosa becomes engaged to Thomas Sutpen, but when he suggested they attempt to produce a male heir before marriage, she breaks off the engagement and moves back to Jefferson. Following her broken engagement to Sutpen, except for Sunday church services she stays anchorite in her house in Jefferson. Along with other characters Rosa was caught up in the design vortex of the demon demiurge Thomas Sutpen. Faulkner has spun an intricate tapestry of polymathic prose. He experiments with characters becoming part of telling the story. The story is told from three views, Rosa Coldfield, Mr. Compson whos father knew Sutpen, and Quentin and Shreve who are college roomates and who tell and imagine parts of the story in their cold, cold room deep into one winter night. Reading Absalom, Absalom! is like being lost in a maze turning corners and finding where you have been before but a little different, something added, growing dimensional jigsaw until you hit the exit panting in the cold air, the iron New England dark saying I could go again like you have been on some phantasmagoric carnival ride."
"Absalom, Absalom!",0679732187,William Faulkner,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"I dove into this book not knowing what is about and was initially disappointed to discover that it was about the South (I am not particurally interested in it because most of the movies and books about it have bored me, except To Kill a Mockingbird).  However, this is a rich telling that gets better after wading the through the initial confusion.  It's not an easy read, so you have to really pay attention.  Also, memory and reconstruction of memories are integral, which adds to the confusion.  Overall, a great American novel.  The story is okay, if not a bit hard to identify with;  it's the storytelling that's incredible."

Packer's treatment of the attributes of God is an excellent read for both the academic and casual reader.  He breathes live into what is too often presented as a boring subject.  I found his ideas extremely thought provoking and insightful.  Even with his thorough understanding of theology, Packer still makes the book a joy to read and reread, as I have done many times in the few years I have owned my copy.  For the brand new and seasoned Christian alike, I highly reccomend this book to anyone who wants to really know God."

"The Bourne Legacy (Jason Bourne, #4)",0312999526,Eric Van Lustbader,Barnes and Noble,3.7,nprfan1,"Eric van Lustbader's plot moves along like a house on fire. It doesn't miss a beat and there are no skips in the story. But when you compare this story to the original trilogy by the late Robert Ludlum, it's like looking at a piece of paper instead of a block of wood - there's just no ""there"" there. I had no problem with the character of Khan and who he turned out to be - Ludlum's plots always required you to suspend your belief in the logical and the ordinary, so that didn't matter one bit. But van Lustbader doesn't flesh Khan out at all, and makes too big a deal out of his reason for pursuing Jason Bourne. And unlike in Ludlum's books, there are no characters in this story with any redeemable values whatsoever. If I want to visit Jason Bourne's world again I think I'll open one of Ludlum's books."
"The Bourne Legacy (Jason Bourne, #4)",0312999526,Eric Van Lustbader,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,"This book is terrible for 3 reasons.  1. If the author is going to use a well known and loved character from previous books, then the history of that character should be incorporated into the book, and the long-term story should be advanced.  This book does not do this.  A good example of a book that does this is 'The Godfather Returns' by Mark Winegarder.  2. Do not make the FBI, CIA, KGB, or the Mob into mental midgets.  In this book, a lone assassin outthinks Bourne, and the CIA and FBI are clueless in terms of chasing him.  3. Some of the plot points in this book are far fetched.  For example, Bourne is being held by the bad guy in a room.  This room is secret, and gaurded by some advanced security measures.  A character rescues Bourne, and how do they escape.  The drain for the blood, is big enough for two men to jump in and it leads to a river.  Why would a drain be that big, it should be the size of a bathroom drain. And if for some reason, it had to be, why not have bars or some other type of security measures at the end of the tunnel.  Another example is a man is thrown out of an airplane that is taking off.  This man is not injured at all.  I don't know how fast a plane needs to go to lift off, but to land on on a concrete pavement, going that speed will either kill you, or put you in the hospital for a very long time.  This book is just terrible."
"The Bourne Legacy (Jason Bourne, #4)",0312999526,Eric Van Lustbader,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,"I was a devoted fan of Ludlum's Bourne series, so I was excited to discover that the Bourne estate had approved the continuation of the series.  Although I wasn't familiar with Eric van Lustbader, I was eager to read this book.    The Bourne Legacy disappointed me on many levels.  Some of the characters may have shared names with Ludlum's characters, but the resemblance didn't go far beyond that.  One of the things that bothered me the most was that van Lustbader's characters are emotionally binary: zero or volcanic.  What character development was there seemed two-dimensional and unbelievable.      I was willing to plow beyond the first few chapters in the hope that things would settle down, but I finally had to give up.  The poor writing quality was too much for me.  I can't recall the last book I read where I kept saying to myself, 'I can write better than this!'  Honestly, I'm not being arrogant here -- I just felt like going through the text like a high school English teacher, marking the awkward dialogue and the klunky use of metaphors.    Van Lustbader's later Bourne books may be better than this one, but I'm going to have to see some awfully good reasons to give them a try."

I've probably read this a dozen times and I never get tired of it. Full of passion, humor, and even a dash of action. Very rich in that deep emotional turbulence that only MS Mcnaught can deliver. Not just conflict in the feelings between the hero and the heroine, but also among the other characters. what I also really loved about this novel is that I have a learned a lot about medieval England, framed against the backdrop of a fairy-tale like romance.for any Mcnaught enthusiast, the signature ""misunderstandings"" and ""assumptions"" between the hero and the heroine is very evident here. Royce and Jennifer had a long heart-rending journey to make before they reached their happily ever after ending. There were issues abounding regarding family loyalty, acceptance, trust, and finally letting oneself take the risk in falling in love. Both characters had serious emotional dilemma that they had to confront, making the story highly relatable and realistic. Just like a sumptuous masterpiece of a dinner laid out in an ethereal setting, Ms Mcnaught ended the story with the perfect touch, like a delicate piece of dessert; fills you completely and leaves you with a well-satisfied smile on your face.

This world is one in which our cars are extreme luxuries, reserved for the ""swanks"" of the world. Our protagonist definitely does not fit this title. He works as a ship breaker in the light crew, stripping the insides of rusted old buckets, that are our cruise ships and tankers today, of their useful metals. Salvage. After growing too large to navigate the small crevices of the ships, the only hope one has is to grow large enough to make the heavy crew, or make a ""Lucky Strike."" Nailer, the lead role, lives on a small beach with an abusive father and helpful friend, working day-in and day-out in asbestos, rat droppings, and oil fumes for a meager wage that barely feeds him and pays for his father's addictions.

I guess my favorite novels by Mr. Patterson give or take a few others are ""Along Came a Spider"" and ""Kiss the Girls"". Now, ""Beach Road"" was in my opinion not up to par for Mr. Patterson & co. I would say that this novel was somewhere in the middle if I was to find a slot to fit this novel in. The only problem I had with the story was the ending. James or Peter, really need to talk to each other because the ending was loose and for me didn't really make sense. Other than the ending the story moved along at the beginning, at a excellent pace, and it kept interest although there were some awkward dalogue here and there.

The Frankenstein series is one of his best yet.  This series is fun, exciting & suspenseful.  Koontz has taken Mary Shelley's Frankstein novel to whole new level.  I have been waiting for the past 3 years for the 3rd installment of this exciting series.  Each year I have been told that the release date of Frankenstein #3 would be pushed off for another year.  It is very disappointing to see that Dean Koontz is rereleasing the ""Prodical Son - Book One"" while leaving his fans to wait even longer.  I highly recommend this novel if you don't mind being left hanging in limbo for an ending."

It would help if one has previously read Koontz's full-length novel of the same name as the graphic novel under review does not cover quite the same ground and some details are missing that the novel ex- pands considerably. Therefore, you need both books for the full picture and start with the novelfirst. I am interested to see how Part 2 of the graphic novel is treated as compared to its predecessor. I should also mention that both the original novels and the new graphic equivalents may be too intense for some younger readers The above caveats aside,I  enjoyed the book and I (a dedicated Koontz fan) look forward to the next installment."

It is a story about two slave girls, Isabel and Ruth, and their fight for freedom.  The main character of the story is the oldest of the two girls, Isabel, and the story is seen through her eyes.  It depicts all the struggles and hardships they go through and yet they still remain optimistic and hopeful that one day they will be free.  This is a book that I could hardly put down.  I became engrossed in her story and I learned some History from it. There is a sequal to the book that the author is working on called ""Forge"" that I anticipate will be just as good and it will continue Isabel and Ruth's quests for freedom."

The Federalist Papers,0451528816,"Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, John Jay, Philo-Publius, Clinton Rossiter, Charles R. Kessler",Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"To say that The Federalist Papers is a work of great importance is an understatement in many ways.  First, it is a classic volume of political theory...indeed  it is America's great contribution to political theory.  The Federalist Papers stand alongside Leviathan,, Two Treatises, The Social Contract, and The Spirit of the Laws as the great works of the age.  Second, it is the first and best defense for constitutionalism, particularly, the American Constitution, which it promoted with unwavering and ferocious ardor. What few people outside the scholastic disciplines of American history, political theory, and American jurisprudence realize is how majestic and remarkable the American Constitution and all that encompasses it really are.  When the Articles of Confederation failed, the need for a new document outlining a better system of government was needed.  What emerged from the 1787 Philadelphia convention was grander and more misunderstood than anyone could have envisioned.  Indeed, Sir William Pitt, the famous English Parliamentarian and jurist said of the American efforts  , 'It will be the wonder and admiration of all future generations, and the model of all future constitutions.'  Even more remarkable is that such a radical document, formulated as the result of debate and compromise, was ever ratified.  America's radical experiment may never have seen the light of day were it not for the eloquent and brilliant arguments proffered by Publius.  In careful study of the making of this remarkable document, one can begin to appreciate how unique the American experience really is begins to emerge.  The nature of Publius' arguments is testament to The Federalist Papers universal and immortal impact.  These essays are the definitive argument for Republican democracy, and, indeed, self-government and the notion of a government which operated under the principles set forth in the Declaration of Independence.  The Federalist Papers, along with a few other documents (The Declaration of Independence, the writings of James Wilson, and the great speeches of Lincoln, form elegant and eloquent testament to why democracy should work.  Than I can write this unworthy and insignificant missive is testament to why these great men, Publius and all the rest, were right."
The Federalist Papers,0451528816,"Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, John Jay, Philo-Publius, Clinton Rossiter, Charles R. Kessler",Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"The Federalist is a must read for anyone interested in the origins of US government, American political values, the history of colonial America or Democracy.  Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay authored the 85 part piece as letters to the editor to gain public support for the new consititution.  This gives it a comprehensive and admittedly (by the author(s)) repetitive look at the reasoning behind every decision made in writing the Constitution.  It provides an explanation for American government, but it's true strength as a work of political theory is that it articulates American political values by it creating them, rather than by reporting them through a historical lens.  Finally, while reading the book, any student of American history or politics can not stray from the importance of the work.  I still find it awe inspiring thinking that it was written by some of America's greatest minds, and even today has an undeniable influence on the world's oldest democracy."

"The Story of the Lost Child (The Neapolitan Novels, #4)",1609452860,"Elena Ferrante, Ann Goldstein",Barnes and Noble,4.6,carlosmock,"The story of the lost Child by Elena Ferrante (pseudonym) - Book Four of the Neapolitan Novels. Translated from the Italian to English by Ann Goldstein 

This is the conclusion of the story started six decades early.  It's the story of Elena Greco and Rafaella Cerullo (Lina).  Their friendship over time and it concerns to the Neapolitan history.

It opens in 1975, just after Elena abandons her husband, Pietro, for Nino Sarratore.  This causes a lot of strain in the lives of her daughters, Dede and Elsa.  With Nino, she conceives another daughter, Imma.  Lina decides to have a child with Enzo, with whom she has lived for a long time.  Tina and Imma are born within weeks and they become good friends.  Lina and Enzo run a successful computer company and they are wealthy.

However, one day Tina ( it was September 16, 1984 and Tina is four years old) disappears (thus the ""Lost Child"") and things go south for both women.  Nino leaves Elena.  Enzo and Lina break up.  Elsa, Elena's daughter, runs away with Rino, Lina's son.  It is in this act that the Elena Greco's lifestyle becomes relevant.  She was unfaithful to her husband, she had an out of wedlock daughter - so it's not surprising that her daughter follows the same path.

This book's prose is much better than the first three books.  Still narrated from the first person point of view - this last book feels more real.  No need for anyone else's perspective.  It's clear that Elena is a self-centered woman and can only care for herself.  At points, she prefers the company of her lovers over the duties of motherhood.  Other times, she prefers to write to the extreme of neglecting her children. For the first time, I understand why she has insisted on writing from the first person point of view - Elena does not care about anyone other than herself.  

Through the story, Naples comes alive.  Ther's a vivid description on the earthquake that ravaged Naples on November 23. 1980. There is a clear description of the trouble with government corruption, drug addiction, and crime. At the end, Elena confesses that even though she has written on Naples and about Naples, she has no clue as to what Naples is.  She uses Lina to give meaning to Naples' history as Elena imagines a book that Lina is writing on the subject.  

The book ends in 2002 just like it started in book one - with Lina disappearance and her unknown whereabouts."
The Disreputable History of Frankie Landau-Banks,0786838183,E. Lockhart,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Annibebe,"This book is extremely well-written and witty.  I do recommend it; however it does have a slightly clich&#233;d ending.  Overall, it's a very cute story of finding  yourself and defining yourself during high school - albeit a rich, extremely exclusive high school."
The Disreputable History of Frankie Landau-Banks,0786838183,E. Lockhart,Barnes and Noble,4.1,bookduck,"Frankie returns to Alabaster Preparatory Academy, a boarding school, for her sophomore year. She's a little curvier than before, and the boys are noticing--although the only boy she cares about is Matthew Livingston, her crush since freshman year. In fact, much of the story 
is set in motion when Frankie, who is riding a bike, sees Matthew in the first few days of school and becomes so distracted that she loses control of the bike and skins her knee. Matthew comes running over to make sure she's okay, and the two begin to flirt. Two important threads are established: 1) Matthew cannot remember meeting Frankie in the previous year, and 2) Matthew obviously enjoys coming to Frankie's aid.

Matthew's inability to remember Frankie gives her a small feeling of insignificance, and inadvertent as well as fake forgetfulness figure prominently in the novel. When Frankie begins to suspect that Matthew is involved in a secret society called the Loyal Order of the Basset Hounds, she follows him. As their relationship develops, she expects him to tell her more about the Order. Matthew doesn't. Frankie is frustrated--Matthew won't trust her, and she can't join the Order because she is a girl.

In addition to dating Matthew, Frankie is swept up into his world, his friends--and she likes it there, something that I believe many girls can identify with. Most of us have either been Frankie or Frankie's friend, watching her become so wrapped up in her boyfriend's life that she begins to forget she has her own. Matthew is sweet and nice--everything a girl could ask for, but he never makes an effort to get to know Frankie's world. And as much as Frankie loves being with Matthew and his friends--other members of the Order and their girlfriends--she dislikes her place in that world. Matthew and his friends discount her as being a sweet sophomore girl. Frankie longs for equal status, recognition, and power. So she decides to do something about it.

I loved this book. LOVED. IT.

The cast of characters is strong and well-rounded, no matter how big or small their roles. The pacing was spot-on; every time I sat down to read for ""just a little while"", I lost track of time and just kept reading. I had to know what happened next! I thoroughly enjoyed the writing, and Frankie's wordplay is half the fun of the book. She plays with grammar and comes up with ""neglected positives"". For example, possible is the neglected positive of impossible.  When applied to other words such as ""disturbed"" and ""indulge"", the concept becomes more amusing. (I'll save the full explanation for Frankie). There's also a secret society, a mystery, a relationship, and many pranks!

The Disreputable History of Frankie Landau-Banks is also a book that stayed with me--it's been two days since I finished it, and I'm still trying to make sense of Frankie. Thank you, E. Lockhart, for an engrossing, entertaining, and thought provoking book. I highly, highly (with a gold star!) recommend this book."

The Postmistress,0143145444,"Sarah Blake, Orlagh Cassidy",Barnes and Noble,3.5,CBH,"This novel should become a real masterpiece.  Sarah Blake captures the reader, transplants them into the late 1930's and early 1940's, and places them in the minds and bodies of those living before and during World War II.  From a small New England town Frankie Bard went to London and researched news and interest for Edward R. Murrow, the voice America knew as he reported for CBS from London and vicinity during that war.  Frankie eventually started doing her small bits on Mr. Murrow's show.  Her voice also became known from her own human-interest stories and news.  

The area was a sea of bombed and burned out buildings from which the residents of the area fled when the warning sirens went off and hustled to get underground to the protected shelters.  As they stayed in those crowded shelters they could hear bombs going off above and feel the blast of the shells.  They could smell the burning buildings, and taste the dust that crept into every corner of the city, above and beneath ground.  

Back in the United States Iris James became the Postmistress of the post office that happened to be in the same town where Frankie Bard lived.  The town was directly on the coast with some of those in town always on the lookout for German submarines surfacing off their coast.  The war was far away but one never knew about the Germans and their war machine.  Emma and Will Fitch had married.  Will was the town doctor.  Will got the urge to go to England to help all the wounded but of course, Emma was dead set against that.  She knew after a short time that Will would never be happy until he did leave and tend to those in misery.  Little did Will know that Emma was pregnant when he left and he would not find out as long as he was away.

The descriptions sent out to the world by Frankie and Edward Murrow gave an idea of just how bad London and surrounding areas had been hit but still the people were so resilient that they bounced back.  Of course there were casualties, wounded and dead, but those able had to carry on, and they indeed did.  The United States was not in the war yet even though many around the world felt they should be.  Frankie asked permission of Edward Murrow to go to Germany and other nations under their control to report what she was able.  Being American she could travel fairly easy but when she did travel, the brutality she saw hurt her deeply.  She reported it as well as possible but the censors stopped all but the normal news, or in some situations she could ""code"" words or phrases to get the news out.  She saw the persecution of the Jews, the killing of those considered a ""danger"" to the Germans, the torture of humans, and the hurt imposed on their daily lives.

Frankie had a primitive recording device she used to record the sounds and voices of those she met along the way.  When she ran out of recording discs she recorded over at least one of them not knowing what would be on that disc.  Frankie eventually and suddenly went home to try to recoup her mind and body but there was no way to get the horrible things she had seen out of her memory.  She tried to fit into the small town again but had a very hard time talking to people.  She kept seeing and hearing things from her trip.  She played and replayed the discs. 

Here I will stop describing this fantastic book.  By now you have to have whetted your minds appetite to read this book.  If ""Postmistress"" doesn't win a lot of writing awards I will be very disappointed.  S"
The Postmistress,0143145444,"Sarah Blake, Orlagh Cassidy",Barnes and Noble,3.5,Biblio_Sue,"The Postmistress is a novel focusing on three American women in the early days of World War II, prior to the US entering the war.  The title itself is misleading; the postmistress of the town is a main character, but she certainly isn't the focus of the book.
 The book jacket's description describes a letter not being delivered, which implies that it is a key turning point; I found that once this happened (halfway through the novel) the fact that it was not delivered was irrelevant to the story.  There are a number of other plot points that I found to be either not relevant or not fully resolved by the end.
 I really wanted to love this book, and there are passages that are excellent, but as a whole I was disappointed."
The Postmistress,0143145444,"Sarah Blake, Orlagh Cassidy",Barnes and Noble,3.5,dhaupt,"The Postmistress is Sarah Blake's debut novel. A literary masterpiece set in pre WW11 America she gives us a glimpse of what life was like. She gives us colorful and unforgettable characters as she takes us through war torn Europe and she does it with grace and style. She keeps you entertained while straining your emotions and pulling your heartstrings.
	Sarah's story is one that's been told a thousand times, a story about life just before and during WW11, but she throws in a twist, a twist called fate and what happens when fate is challenged. And that twist makes this plot so unique. She takes us on a journey with her wonderful descriptive dialogue. She is an amazing storyteller and her words took me to those places from her book and I could see the aftermath of bomb stricken London and pre WW11 small town USA. But what she surely excels in is her characters who are all so well defined and developed that they actually appear three dimensional to me. She takes us right to the heart of her story and shows us faces of the forgotten in Europe and let's us hear their voices. She has strong women characters and shows us just what they're made of. It's a tale of love and loss, of heartache and heartbreak, of friendship, cruelty and hate, hopelessness but most of all hope.
	So come on a trip through time and experience this wonderful, dynamic and unforgettable read for yourself. It's a must read for all lovers of recent historical fiction, lovers of literary fiction and those of us who love all that plus an unforgettable read."
"Rise of Empire (The Riyria Revelations, #3-4)",0316187704,Michael J. Sullivan,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Will0,"I picked up Theft of Swords nearly three weeks ago, looking for a new book or series to read. I read the back, trying to get a feel for the book. It looked interesting but I was not going to get my hopes up. All I expected was a decent story. I was proven wrong. The story was not decent. It was brilliant. Sullivan begins the story with the two main characters on a mission. While many books take a while to draw you in, Theft of Swords abandons that, drawing you in on the first page. And it does not relinquish it's hold. 
     In my reading, I have found that many authors have &quot;filler&quot; sentences and chapters. While these are okay, they often detract from the story. Throughout the Riyria Revelations, I cannot think of a single word, let alone sentence or chapter, that I would call &quot;filler&quot;. There were many times that a character was introduced, one whom I THOUGHT was &quot;filler&quot; and would simply disappear. Time and time again, I was proven wrong. The character would be introduced again, be it a chapter or a book later, and would interact with the main characters, Royce and Hadrian, proving vital to the progression of the story. 
     If I were to identify one thing I think Sullivan does that is truly exceptional, I would have to say CHARACTERIZATION. Throughout the series, Sullivan carefully describes the characters, giving them their own lives and meaning. After reading the series, there is not a single character that I do not identify with (and understand). To use a clich&eacute;, the characters &quot;jump of the page&quot;, taking over your mind and thought. Ultimately, this is a goal all writers have: to make the reader understand their characters, enjoy them, and find entertainment with them. This does not always happen, however, and the impressive thing Sullivan accomplished is not only pulling it off with one or two characters but each and every one of them. Literally. 
     I am an avid reader, always have been, and always will be. Bookshelves adorn the walls of my house, the one in my bedroom reserved for my favorite books. The top shelf (on the far left) is specifically reserved for my favorite book, or series. This is where my copy of the Riyria Revelations now reside. I also have each of them on my Nook (tablet), Apple iPad, and Apple iPhone so I can have them wherever I go (literally). I have heard it said many times that a great book is one that you feel you can read over and over again. I do not always agree with this statement. There have been books I have read that I would classify as great that I would not read again, at least for a very long time. Riyria: I will read over and over again. I know it. I cannot now. I am in college, currently struggling my way through a week of midterms before Spring Break, and I want to try out a long list of books I have stored in Notes on my iPhone. But come summer in a couple months, after I have gotten through four or five of the sixty books on my reading list, I have no doubt that I will return to the Riyria Revelations for another, in depth read. For me, Riyria was not just a great series. It is my favorite series and Sullivan, whom I had never heard of before has become my favorite author. I am looking forward to what the future brings in terms of his writing and hope, or pray, that he will return to it (and publish more) someday."

Tweak: Growing Up On Methamphetamines,1416913629,Nic Sheff,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"I really enjoyed tweak. It was my first time reading a memoir based book and I thought it was very well written. Almost like you were right there by Nic sides experiencing everything he was experiencing. In was first was introduced to this in book in my Popular Literature class. I was drawn into, because it seemed like one of those books you had to read. One of those books that was juicy and just plain bad. I don¿t mean bad because of the way it was written but bad because it was about drugs and the party lifestyle. Come on what high school kid doesn¿t want to know about drugs and there influences. But when I started reading the book I realized there was more to it then just meth. It was about Nic  recovery and his constant battle with crystal meth. How hard it was for him to live his life like a normal twenty one year old and how his past reflected upon his future. I mean how he grew up so fast and instead of confronting his problems he turned to drug abuse. I mean putting anything into his body that he could. It made me realize how hard it is to just stop using drugs and moving on. Like they say once you have tried the drug and experience the high it offers you will be craving for it for the rest of your life. Personally I really enjoyed this book and it opened my eyes to how bad it could be, if you chose drugs instead of a normal life. It was interesting reading this book because it was written uniquely and shared every aspect of Nic life. I really could not put the book down till I finish. Defiantly, one of those tear jerking books without the sappy love story behind it.  There is a little bit of something for every type of reader."
Tweak: Growing Up On Methamphetamines,1416913629,Nic Sheff,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"In the novel ¿Tweak: Growing up on methamphetamines¿ the author, Nic Sheff, takes the reader on a journey through an addiction to crystal meth, heroin, cocaine and a number of many other substances.  Throughout Nic¿s whole childhood and years as a young adult, Nic always felt he could quit whenever he felt he wanted too. Though after a violent relapse in California, Nic shortly realized that it wasn¿t the case, and that help was most defiantly needed. The message the reader is supposed get from this book is that drugs are extremely scary and dangerous. Any substance can ruin the relationship between family and friends, and Nic does a good job showing the reader just what can happen to a relationship. Some of the pros on the novel are that it can give all non- drug users a reason not to use, and it can scare a drug user and convince a person not to smoke, drink, or shoot up. Throughout the whole novel the reader is watching Nic try and beat the physical and mental depths of an addiction; an extremely heartbreaking thing to watch, scaring the reader with a mental picture that is quite difficult to imagine. The cons about ¿Tweak¿, is that after awhile it is no surprise that Nic has relapsed, or that Nic has lost yet another job. It is simply just a life story about Nic¿s addiction, meaning, whenever a new conflict comes up, there is no surprise on how it is resolved. This novel is very informational, and shows the reader just what life is like as a homeless, drug addict, and a struggling young adult trying desperately to get back on track. Also, if the book ¿Tweak¿ was appealing, try the Novel ¿Beautiful Boy¿, a novel about addiction through a parent¿s eye. Overall, out of five, ¿Tweak¿ deserves four and a half ¿hits¿."
Tweak: Growing Up On Methamphetamines,1416913629,Nic Sheff,Barnes and Noble,4.4,JoniF,"An incredible story of addiction, healing and relapse.  Tweak is painfully graphic, taking the reader through the darkest back alleys of drug addiction.  This book should raise awareness that addiction is a powerful disease, and that addicts who fight it are brave, brave souls."
"The Rook (The Checquy Files, #1)",0316098795,Daniel O'Malley,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Qwillery,"When I think of The Rook the first word that comes to mind is 'fun.' Great fun actually. But to simply say that The Rook is 'fun' would be facile on my part. The Rook is a terrific read for a lot of reasons. Foremost The Rook is very well written. The mystery of why Myfanwy Thomas is without her memory and who did what to whom is hard to crack. As soon as I'd thought I'd figured it out, the story proved me wrong. Not because of authorial plot shenanigans, but because the unraveling of the mystery was very well handled. I really enjoyed how this is done with new Myfanwy being aided by information left behind by old Myfanwy. Myfanwy is a wonderful character. She's trying to figure out how to do her job as Rook and racing against time to find who in the Chequy harmed her and why. The Rook is not a short read (nearly 500 pages), but I barely noticed the length. The Chequy is itself amazing. It's a fantastical governmental agency. Think FBI/CIA rolled into one that handles supernatural threats. Yes, other supernatural agencies exist in literature, but none quite like the Chequy. How the Chequy functions is explained well, but never bogs down the story. I really enjoyed seeing how the Chequy works, how threats are handled, and meeting the people with whom Myfanwy works, despite that fact that one of them wants her erased. Mr. O'Malley's scrupulous attention to detail creates a believable, if somewhat unusual, governmental agency. The upper echelon of the Chequy are fascinating characters themselves. Because Myfanwy is trying to figure out which of them might be after her, we get to know each of them well. I certainly enjoyed learning about them and their powers... and trying to figure out who did it and why. Mr. O'Malley has infused The Rook with wry humor, unusual supernatural beings, and a deeply absorbing mystery. The Rook made me laugh out loud, entertained me, and kept me fascinated from start to finish. I give The Rook 5 Qwills. Originally posted at The Qwillery."
"The Rook (The Checquy Files, #1)",0316098795,Daniel O'Malley,Barnes and Noble,4.6,fairchristabel,"This is easily the best book I've read this year.  It's funny and extremely well-written.  For me, The Rook is the most seamless blending of reality and fantasy since Harry Potter.  I've tried other urban fantasy books and series, but they usually feel like they're trying too hard to make the fantastical seem mundane.  In The Rook , I never question the presence of the supernatural (of course, some of that may have to do with the fact that it's set in England, and I find it much easier to believe in possibility of magic there).  Myfanwy is an amazing character.  She's smart and strong and funny and feels like a real person.  The Rook carries along at a brisk pace; I never felt my interest flag.  A really run read which (hopefully) leads up to a whole series."
"The Rook (The Checquy Files, #1)",0316098795,Daniel O'Malley,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"Clever and aggressively readable, I stayed up way too late one night because I got utterly caught up. The author has an engaging style and the story, while playing with themes we all find familiar, seems fresh and new. Another reviewer complained that they were looking towards some loose ends with a hope that this might be the start of a series, and I have to say, I agree. While no loose ends were presented, I do hope to see the return of Myfanwy Thomas."
"The Looking Glass Wars (The Looking Glass Wars, #1)",0803731531,Frank Beddor,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Meg0705,"Personally, I've always been a little freaked out by Alice in Wonderland. But with the new movie coming out, I thought I would read something similar. That's when I came across this book! While it is like the original in lots of ways, it's completely and totally different, which makes it interesting. Supposedly, the story Lewis Carroll told was all wrong. Therefore it's Beddor's job to set the record strait. Wonderland isn't as wacky as we thought it was. In fact, it lots of ways, the Wonderlanders are even more sophisticated than humans. Unfortunately a civil war has broke out in Wonderland, and it seems family is killing family. I guess the reason why I liked this book so much was because it was out of the box. It told a different version of Alice in Wonderland but still told a fantastical story with interesting characters. Hope you give it a try!"
"The Looking Glass Wars (The Looking Glass Wars, #1)",0803731531,Frank Beddor,Barnes and Noble,4.4,karen-kelley,"If you like Alice in Wonderland this is an amazing read. It takes an alternate look at the original Alice in Wonderland. A kind of ""What if?"" book. If Wonderland really did exsist parallel to our world. It's creative and pulls you in. Great book for young adults and adults. It was amazingly easy to read, and so hard to put down."
"The Looking Glass Wars (The Looking Glass Wars, #1)",0803731531,Frank Beddor,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Katmandu83,"I recently found this re-imagined version of ""Alice in Wonderland"" on the shelves of a local bookstore.  I bought it on a whim, because I'd recently reread the Carroll version.  It took me several weeks to actually pick up the book and begin it.  Once I did, I couldn't put it down.  I found myself in the depths of imagination.  It's cleverly reconfigured the classic tale in a way I would never have thought.  
     Alyss Heart is a care-free seven year old, when all she's ever known is ripped from her.  Her ruthless Aunt Redd has come to reclaim her throne as ruler of Wonderland.  In the process Alyss' parents are killed by Redd, and Alyss escapes with her bodyguard Hatter Madigan through the Pool of Tears into our world.  Alyss and Hatter are seperated in the Pool of Tears.  Hatter spends many years criss-crossing the globe in search of his lost princess.  His hopes in finding her, so they can return to Wonderland and Alyss can reclaim her place as Queen of Wonderland.
     The re-imagining of Carroll's classic characters is intriguing and imaginative.  The Cat, is Redd's assassin who can morph from a human bodied cat into an innocent looking kitten. The caterpillars are oracles.  Hatter, the insanely mad tea party throwing character, instead is a blade wielding bodyguard for the royal family.  
      I thoroughly enjoyed this book, along with it's sequel ""Seeing Redd"" ... and can't wait for the third in the trilogy ""ArchEnemy"" to be released.  Frank Beddor has unleashed his imagination and shared it with us.  I would recommend these books to anyone who loved the original version and loves fantasy.  The cover art, along with the artwork inside the books is also wickedly amazing.  Enjoyed it all!"

This book however, was long and boring.  The subject itself was a good choice the storyline in my opinion was dull and lifeless.  The Queen being moved from one place to another, plotting her escape.....yawn.  I wish she would have chose to write about the queen during her time upon the throne.  The Queen of Scots had a fascinating life during her reign, full of scandal and turmoil.  It would have made a sensational historical novel.
I usually read one of Philippa's books in a day and reread them several times.  I had to force myself to finish this one and I will not reread it."
"The Other Queen (The Plantagenet and Tudor Novels, #15)",1416549129,Philippa Gregory,Barnes and Noble,3.5,KenCady,"This is a story told in segments, with each chapter telling one's story, and then rotating to each other. It makes for frustrating reading as the pacing is horrible. I am well familiar with the story and looked forward to a dramatic telling, but this is a very disappointing book."

There was hardly any dialogue in the book! Even if a book is slow, I usually try to force myself to finish, but I just couldn't with this one. Poorly written and just no story. Hopefully, Gregory will reprove herself with her next one because I love all of her other books!!!"
Labor Day,0061843407,Joyce Maynard,Barnes and Noble,3.7,SharonChance,"Labor Day weekend, for most, is a time for celebration, a last fling before the seriousness of school and fall set in.

In Joyce Maynard's new novel, ""Labor Day,"" the holiday weekend is not quite a party for one family in a small New Hampshire town. It will be a time of life-altering occurrences that would shape their futures forever.

Thirteen year old Henry and his mother, Adele, are shopping for school items when they are approached by a bleeding man asking for their help. So they take him home, to find out later that the man, Frank, is an escaped convict on the run. He somehow cajoles Adele into letting him stay while the police search for him, and she agrees. This would be the beginning of a six-day odyssey for Henry and his mother that neither of them could ever have imagined.

As the story unfolds, through Henry's voice, the reader is taken through Henry's family history of a bitter divorce, miscarried babies, remarriage and new siblings and his mother's gradual loss of her grip on reality. It seems as if Frank is somewhat of a savior come to turn their lives around. He gives Henry the attention that he craves from a father-figure, and to Adele he gives companionship and adoration that she has been without for so long.

In a mesmerizing way, Frank weaves his way into their lives, making beautiful promises that he could never keep. When Henry begins to realize that this idyllic situation is doomed, it's up to him, as man of the house, to save his mother from certain heartbreak, if not incarceration.

Maynard spins a fascinating story of damaged people seeking the one thing they long for - love. It's intriguing to watch these characters go through their paces, all the time wanting to yell at them ""don't you know what's going on here?"" and ""how could you be so stupid?"" But wrapping her tale up with a satisfying ending, the reader can take away a sense of completion for Henry's family and that is a gift in itself.

"I Shall Wear Midnight (Discworld, #38; Tiffany Aching, #4)",0385611072,Terry Pratchett,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Harbin,"For those familiar with the works of Pratchett, you will not be disappointed. For those new to Discworld, it will leave you wanting to know more of not only the backstories of the characters in this book, but other inhabitants that make Discworld a favorite escape from reality for millions of Terry Pratchett fans worldwide.

This is the first of his works that I have read on my Nook, so it took me a second to figure out how to access the footnotes that Pratchett utilizes in every book of his that I have read. You have to wake up your touch screen, then touch the circle on the right side to select the footnote. Once it is read, you touch the circle again to take you back to the page you were reading."
"I Shall Wear Midnight (Discworld, #38; Tiffany Aching, #4)",0385611072,Terry Pratchett,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Ashburysgr,"I was able to receive a UK copy of this fro a friend and finished this today.  WOW!  I honestly cannot think of one part of this book that was a let down.  The whole book flowed from begining to end.  The action was very well paced, and I must say very dark for a Young Adult novel, but that is the good thigabout Terry's work.  He knows that young adult are just that young adults.  As he stated in Theif of Time, kittens and puppies grow up to be cats and dogs, so kids need to have more adult material to help change their minds, to hlp shape them into the adults that they will become.  And a bit of a spolier here that is what this book is about.  Changing the way people think, perfect topic for Young Adults, but no even for Young Adults for Adult Adults as well.

It seems that some characters might be coming to an end, but others are rising to take their place.  It is nice to see old characters coming back into the series after so long away.  I want to say more, but don't want to give away too much.

What is really sad is the cover art of the books since on the UK covers there is a HUGE HINT as to the ending of the book that s lost with the US covers.  I think the artists in the US should be fired and just spend the money and get Kidby's cover art on th book.  I think the money that they mae from Terry's work would give them more than enought for that, and they would make even more.

But as I said a GREAT book, and most definately worth a second, third, fourth, fifth..... reading.  When this is released I wil buy i for my nook and I might wear out the screen reading it so much.

Also, when it is stated that this is the last Tiffany book I do not thin that we have seen the last of Tiffany.  Just like this and othe novels (especially with this novel) characters keeping coming back for cameos.  Plus is you look a Stephen King when he said that he would write no more Dark Tower novels, now there will be a 8th book in the works I do not thing an author can never say never!  I hope so Tiffany is a hell of a character and not to write about her would be horrible.

Buy this book and enjoy many many times!"

But there's so much more to it than that. It's entertaining. It's engaging. It's educational. It made me want to work for Pixar. They put as much thought into how their employees interact and engage with each other as they do their next script and movie idea. This book is truly inspiring. READ IT.

If you have followed along with the animation story at all then the details add rich color to the history of the films produced and the growth of the industry. I found it to be captivating, even if you had never seen a Pixar film the story is filled with the sense of working to bring to life ideas that are only imagined. The success of the company is secondary to the struggles and the growth of the individuals who championed a new way of making films come to life."

The photocopies of the pages are rich in color and the artwork is just phenomenal.

The Diary of Frida Kahlo: An Intimate Self-Portrait,0810959542,"Frida Kahlo, Carlos Fuentes, Sarah M. Lowe",Barnes and Noble,5,CozyLover on LibraryThing,"Frida Kahlo was a fascinating, strong woman who I admire. Her rt work is not the ""feel good"" type, such as Monet or Renior, , but it is compelling and full of raw emotion. The things this woman went through are so harsh, from her accident, her multiple operations to her tumultuous marriage to Diego Rivera. All these things come to life in her art and in her personal diary. Her diary completely captivates me. It is so personal, as all good diaries are, that it really gives the reader a glimpse into the ""real"" Frida.  A stunning book full of life, love, loss and anger. This is the heart and soul of Frida."

Stephen King and George Romero's homage to the old EC comics is just so much fun. This comic book adaptation (by Stephen King with art by Berni Wrightson) is a fun read and is beautifully illustrated. But honestly, the adaptation pales in comparison to the original film.The film has stronger writing (King wrote the script for the movie and this adaptation) and (surprisingly) better art direction. Don't get me wrong, Wrightson's artwork is beautiful and suitable creepy, but comes off as less creative than the 'comic book effects' in the movie (colored lines behind the actors, panel borders covered in roaches) and it would have been neat to include the ads for x-ray specs and voodoo dolls. I wonder really why they didn't just reproduce the comic book that was shown throughout the film.Maybe I'm being too harsh on this adaptation. It is a lot of fun. It's just that if you have seen the superb movie this book adds very little to it."
The Darkest Pleasure (Lords of the Underworld #3),0373773102,Gena Showalter,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"Gena Showalter just keeps on getting better and better with her extraordinary Lords of the Underworld paranormal series for HQN in Book #3, THE DARKEST PLEASURE 'July 2008'.  In the Lords Of the Underworld¿s Budapest fortress, Reyes is always hurting himself since Pain is his constant companion.  Centuries ago, Reyes and his fellow immortal warriors let all the demons of the world out of Pandora¿s Box and Reyes ended up being the Keeper of Pain.  In Los Angeles, Danika Ford is in disguise, broke and working at a greasy diner to try to escape the Lords, who had previously kidnapped her, her sister, mother and grandmother in Budapest and then let them go.  However, Aeron, the Keeper of Wrath, has been ordered by Cronus, the King of the Gods, to kill them because they might know too much.  So Danika and her relatives were forced to split up and flee for their lives.  Meanwhile, Reyes, who is enamored of Danika, has imprisoned Aeron so he will not murder her.  Unfortunately the Lords aren¿t the only ones who are after Danika, since the evil Hunters want to find her to help them destroy the Lords.    When Reyes hears the Hunters have captured Danika he goes to her rescue, kills some Hunters and brings her back to Budapest.   Unbelievably Danika seems to have a calming effect on his Demon Pain.  The only problem is Reyes can¿t make love without there being pain involved because his demon finds it pleasurable.   In the meantime, the other Lords are out searching the globe for the three remaining artifacts: the All-seeing Eye, the Cloak of Invisibility and the Paring Rod, they need to find Pandora¿s Box that will put an end to their demon curses.  Will Danika be able to save her family and still remain with Reyes and what about her strange visions and paintings she creates?  And poor Paris, Keeper of Promiscuity, who has made love to countless women but is pining for the only one who has ever rejected him and is lost to him forever?  THE DARKEST PLEASURE is the ultimate pleasurable paranormal romance not only for its amazingly clever plot twists, its delightfully witty dialogue but also for its infinitely touching love story between the dark tortured, Reyes and the angelic feisty, Danika, who¿s finally able to tame him and his inner demon!"

Gena Showalter's Lords of The Underworld series is my hands-down absolute favorite read! The characters are original and very multi-dimensional, and the story sucks you in so that you can't put it down until you're finished!

I recommend this series to any novel lover, not just the romanticists. I can't tell you how frustrating romance novels can be when they completely lack plot, character development, and rush into romance with no thought towards the story itself. The Lords of The Underworld are the total opposite! Go out and pick up your copies today!"

As a paranormal romance-junkie, it is extrememly significant when I say that Gena Showalter is my favorite writer.  She has a knack for writing romance that is unrivaled.  These books are filled with tear-jerking, heart-fluttering, ooo-I-want-one romantic men that you just can't help but adore.  Her witty, engaging dialogue and jaw-dropping, gotta-keep-a-fan-near-by love scenes are definitely worth the read.  She's a must-buy for me and I hope your enjoy her new series."

I love how the   twins finally get to have an adventure since they're the run   of the mills in the family. Most of the characters have   really good chemistry. There's conflict which keeps you   reading on. There are moments while reading when you   come across a paragraph and it makes you appreciate life   a bit more. That's really how much this book means. The   characters grow on you, making them part of your life, in   a way. Over all, the book is fantastic, I recommend it to   anyone with an imagination."

After re-reading Brown Bear with my son, and then following it up with Polar Bear and this one, Panda Bear is hands-down my favorite. The animals and illustrations are wonderful no matter which you book read, but the thing that puts this one over the top is the message it delivers. It's never too early to learn about the importance of protecting wild animals and conservation in general. I like it because this book addresses those issues in a way that it is easy for even a very small child to understand.Absolutely a great book and an essential component to any child's library!"

Eric Carle and Bill Martin are very talented and have intrigued and delighted my students for years with their books.  The book helps provide teachers with innovative ideas for teaching units on endangered animals and to have a concern for animals and to preserve our wildlife.  The illustrations are beautiful.  The children are introduced to new vocabulary and animals that may be unfamilar to them.  The text intrigues children and holds their attention.  I encouraged the children to brainstorm a list of other wild animals and we created a class book as an extension activity. All the children are interested in other animals now besides the typical pets and farm animals they are use to.  I give the book two tumbs up!

It goes through many endangered animals and asks what they see. Each one sees another animal that is on the endangered species list. At the end thte last animal sees a dreaming child who sees each of the animals previously mentioned in the book. Personal Reaction:This is an amazing book for very young readers. It really shows children at a young age what endangered animals are. It's not the easiest thing to bring up with younger children, but this can open up that window. The illustraions by Eric Carle are amazing as expected.Classroom Applications:1. Do a lesson on endangered animals.2. Make a classrom book with each of the childrens faces to mimic the book."
"Love You More (Tessa Leoni, #1; Detective D.D. Warren, #5)",0553807250,Lisa Gardner,Barnes and Noble,4.1,-Madison-,"""Love You More"" is a thriller and loaded with suspense as Tessa Leoni faces time in Hell trying to prove her innocence. She has been a Massachusetts state trooper for four years and has a beautiful six-year-old daughter, Sophie, and a husband, Brian Darby of three years. Brian has been shot to death and Sophie is missing. Detectives on the case soon suspect Tessa of cold blooded murder, having killed her husband and little girl. The forensic evidence is puzzling, and Leoni, who is less than cooperative, has a battered and swollen face, apparently, from a beating. The situation becomes more complicated and ambiguous, and it is suspected that Tessa has been lying to them from the beginning. This one is just plain intriguing from the beginning and the writing impeccable. Madison Pridgen, A member of Between the Lines book club"

"Love You More (Tessa Leoni, #1; Detective D.D. Warren, #5)",0553807250,Lisa Gardner,Barnes and Noble,4.1,nancymitchell,"LOVE YOU MORE begins with a dead man, Brian, whose murder is not just an every day homicide. His wife has been beaten and their young daughter has vanished. Detective DD Warren is called in to investigate. She is joined by State Police investigator Bobby Dodge, her former lover, (previous books).
The badly beaten woman is also a State Police Officer. As the detectives try to make sense of the puzzle they initially believe that the husband could have been a wife beater and she had finally had enough and shot him with her own weapon.  Nothing is as it seems. The occasional hint of a romantic spark flickers between DD and Bobby as they work together in close proximity. 

There is plenty of action on this roller coaster ride to keep the reader engrossed.  LOVE YOU MORE could be considered a bit over-the-top but the fascinating details about prisons, police procedure, and the challenges the detectives face every day in their work make it totally believable. Gardner keeps the reader entertained and thrilled all the way through this sizzling and brilliant page-turner."

This book was fantastic!!! If you love books by Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett, you will greatly enjoy this book, in that this is a modern day version of those excellent novels.  Also if you are a fan of The Wire, the greatest show ever (which Lehane is one of it's writers), this novel weaves important themes such as racism into this book filled with humor, thrills, sexual tension between two Private Investigators, and all things Boston.  Along with Pelecanos, Connelly, and Price, Lehane is one of the best crime writers ever.  Not because they have the most best-sellers (this does not make someone the greatest crime writer), but because they write the most serious and most realistic crime novels."

The two main characters in this book are Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro, a pair of Private Eyes hired to find a missing cleaning lady. Their client is a prominent Boston politician, who wishes to find some documents the cleaning lady stole. What starts out as a rather routine job turns into a wild ride of intrigue, betrayal, and death. As all this plays out we are also treated to the underlying romantic/sexual tension between the two main characters. Best of all this is just the first book in a series Kenzie and Gennaro."

Did she know what he was doing, but the Feds want to know if she knows where the money is.

When Conies brother Nathan (Meredith's first love) joins them on the island, Meredith must rethink her life and who she really is.

I found the characters to be real and felt the pain that Meredith felt, not only from her husband but as a young girl when Nathan broke her heart. These incidents somewhat defined her. Hildebrand's descriptive locations made me felt as I was on the island. I enjoyed this book."

Silver Girl,031609966X,Elin Hilderbrand,Barnes and Noble,4,Dollycas,"This is the quintessential summer beach read.  It takes on the power of friendship, love, loss, forgiveness, trust, happiness, prosperity, misery, and bliss, along with an element of suspense.  It is also very current due to the scandal that happened in New York with Bernie Madoff recently, like I said above, but it shows the other side, that maybe some of the spouses of the Wall Street Execs really could be oblivious to what was really happening.  When they are bringing home that much money it is kind of taken for granted and the how and why is not always questioned. Unfortunately most of us are not in that position so I didn't trust Meredith for a good part of this story, which made it more of a mystery for me as the clues were uncovered and linked together.

I also loved the special ways history was remembered and tied to some very beautiful music.  It made the story so much more real as they were songs I loved from my past.  Just added a wonderful element that set the back stories and much more.

I had the privilege to read an review Hilderbrand's The Island last summer and declared it my Best General Fiction Read of 2010. Elin Hilderbrand has become one of my favorite authors and I can't wait to read her entire back list and anything she writes in the future.

The tagline of this blog is ""Escape With A Good Book"".  This is the perfect ""escape"" book!! I did over the weekend and am so glad I did. Get yours today, fix a nice pitcher of lemonade, splash on a little sunscreen and hit the beach, deck chair, or porch swing and sit back and enjoy this wonderful story.

Practical Magic,0425190374,Alice Hoffman,Barnes and Noble,4.1,1Katherine1,"On the surface this is enjoyable enough-- a great, fun romance story full of all the the right classic ingredients. Then add a smidgen of mystery and a ghost. Finish it off with the all-powerful themes of love, sisterhood, and family, all written with Hoffman's dreamy prose.
Simply, this book is an addiction, gorgeous and well-plotted with fantastic characters and development.
If you're a hopeless romantic looking for a very real story with just a touch of magic, this is it."

Practical Magic,0425190374,Alice Hoffman,Barnes and Noble,4.1,kaydanielle,"I just finished re-reading. I think it was even better the second time, though I dont know if that is even possible. This story is relatable for everyone - from a 16 year old girl like me, to an adult. There are so many twists and turns as you follow the lives of two sisters. It is magical and mysterious and it is incredibly realistic. Every time I read it I cry because of how the story touches me. Hoffman writes like no other. Must read."

1114,North and South,0140620192,"Elizabeth Gaskell, Alan Shelston",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"I first saw the BBC miniseries about 18 months ago.  I was enthralled.  The story has many similarities to the beloved Pride and Predjudice, but the setting and scope of the story are much deeper.

The story is primarily set in the two different worlds in Victorian England.  Gently born and raised Margaret is pulled away from the genteel life she is accustomed to in the South of England, to live in a northern manufacturing town. The two very differing climates are metaphors for the experiences and people by whom she is surrounded.

Her own predjudices are tested along a personal journey that opens her heart and mind.  Themes of devotion and love are timeless.  The more weighty issues of poverty, fair business practices and moral duty are also timeless. In our age of greed, a lot could be gained by reading some of the Victorians like Elizabeth Gaskell and Charles Dickens.

This book may not be an easy read to everyone.  But if you've read Austen and/or Dickens, it is an enjoyable book.  This reader loves history and also loves good romance.   I read the final chapter three times because I found it so deeply satisfying.

If you have seen the BBC adaptation, you'll find that it's not entirely true to the book.  However, I found them to have the same soul and spirit.  North and South is now part of my permanent collection."
1114,North and South,0140620192,"Elizabeth Gaskell, Alan Shelston",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"I saw BBC's movie production of North and South first and then decided I had to read the novel by Elizabeth Gaskel. I was not dissapointed.  If anything it will enhance the movie experience because it gives you more details/information about the characters, their actions and events that take place in the novel.  This story tells of the hardships that people faced on a daily basis.  The love story of John Thornton and Margaret Hale is especially touching because they both had to overcome  prejudices 'on her part' and missunderstandings 'on his part'.  What a wonderful novel.  I highly recommend this novel to anyone who has already seen the movie.  I have to admit both the movie and the novel of North and South surpasses all versions of Pride and Prejudice."
1114,North and South,0140620192,"Elizabeth Gaskell, Alan Shelston",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Libejin,"I recommend it to everyone who likes Victorian era classics, romance, and good historical imagery. I read North and South the first time during my first semester of grad school in 2008 after watching the BBC version on DVD. So I got to compare the endings and read the commentary & footnotes, & etc. I liked the book version better than the DVD, except for the ending and watching Richard Armitage play John Thornton. After re-watching the DVD a few times over 3-1/2 years I bought N&S for my Nook and re-read it with fresh perspective this month (June 2012), and love the book even more than the first time I read it. I understand the ending much better because I get the spirit of the message Gaskell meant for us to come away with. The dvd ending (on the train) gives us a metaphorical visual of what E. Gaskell would have written if she'd been given 21st Century freedom at the time of the Victorian periodical. I am in love with her John Thornton (again)."

1115,A Stolen Life,1451629184,Jaycee Dugard,Barnes and Noble,4.1,DottiePatches,"I read this book in one day.  I couldn't put it down.  I was surprised how much detail (in the beginning of the book) that Jaycee gave about what happened to her but I am glad she did.  People need to know what kind of things men like Phillip Garido are capable of.  My mind had never even thought up those kind of evils.  Prison is not a harsh enough punishment for this man.  Or his wife for that matter.  How dare she not do something!!!!  EGH!  My hear aches as I read this book.  Jaycee and I are 2 years apart and all I could think was how alike we were as kids.  How if we lived by each other as kids we would have been best friends.  I am amazed at how strong she is.  I am SO angry for her!  She chooses not to waste her time on anger.  That the Garidos have stolen enough and she will give them no more.  I wish I had her outlook on life.  Her book shows that no mate her bleak your situation there is always something to be thankful for.  A pet, a beautiful day, freedom.  She is amazing and so is her real family.  Bless her moms heart!  Jaycee's story gives hope in a book that I wasn't looking for it.  Truly Amazing."
1115,A Stolen Life,1451629184,Jaycee Dugard,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"One of my worst fears since become a mother has been the fear of having some monster take my children away from me.  I wasn't sure how or if I could read this book. I read it in a day and a half!  She admits in the beginning that she is not a professional writer and that the story is in her words so it may be confusing at times for someone else reading it but it is how she remembers everything. There were a few times I was slightly confused and felt she repeated things many times. For me, this made the book more real. I knew it was HER story. It made my stomach turn to read about (graphically) the things he did to her and made her do!  The part about her being reunited with her mother for some reason just really got to me. I was bawling! This is a ""read with a tissue box at hand"" book! Jaycee is an UNBELIEVABLE woman and survivor of some unspeakable things! It amazes me how she went through all of that for 18 YEARS and just seems so ""normal"". She seems like a person I would want to know. Not because she is ""famous"" for what happened to her but because she is such a real person. A beautiful person. A strong person. A wonderful mother. Many times reading this book I had thoughts about the things that I ""struggle"" with and said to myself, ""If Jaycee can be so strong through all of that then I can certainly deal with the things in my life that aren't anywhere near as harrowing."" Buy the book! She is a true inspiration!  Jaycee Dugard, I hope you have a life with nothing but the best of the best and happiness overflowing! Wish I could give you a great big hug. Thank you for sharing your difficult story with us."
1116,"The Immortals of Meluha (Shiva Trilogy, #1)",0000000000,Amish Tripathi,Barnes and Noble,3,Saumyakul on LibraryThing,"Who is God? It is not often that I ponder over a question like this. It was especially not until I lay my hands on this one-of-its kind book, called The Immortals of Meluha, authored by Amish. A book that borrows heavily from the royal pages of Indian mythology, The Immortals of Meluha weaves together myths and legends and modern sensibilities with remarkable ease.The book cover was immediately intriguing- the back of the mighty Shiva, with deep scars over a shoulder and an arm; long, majestic tresses falling over his back; a trident elegantly positioned at the very centre of his form; and the backdrop comprising of Indus and the magnificent Mountains of the North. This was easily a book I would have wanted to read, and as it did turn out, it was a book I simply could not keep down once I started on. The first of a series of three (called the Shiva Trilogy), this book tells the story of Shiva, the Destroyer, a much hailed and praised God from the Hindu Trinity of Brahma-Vishnu-Mahesh. One of the boldest attempts in the Indian fantasy fiction genres, this book lays down the hypothesis that Shiva was never actually a God. More so, he did not even belong to India (the Saptasindhu, as mentioned in the book). Blasphemy you would say, but so long as we consider this book to remain within the realm of fiction, it is actually amazing how the author has carved out a story with Shiva as a War Hero, firmly supported by accurate facts and descriptions, giving strong evidence of the author's deep knowledge and research of the subject.The book is set in the Indus Valley Civilization, referred in this book as Meluha (It was only later that my History teacher informed me about the Indus Valley Civilization being called as 'Meluha' by the Sumerians and the Mesopotamians). This civilization was one of the finest the world has ever been testimony to, and is often hailed as the birthplace of men of greatness, because the things they did have not been imitated anywhere, anytime in the world. Before beginning the book, the author makes three claims, the fundamental premise on which his book is based-        I believe that the Hindu gods were not mythical beings or a figment of a rich imagination.        I believe that they were creatures of flesh and blood, like you and me.        I believe that they achieved godhood through their karma, their deeds.The story begins with an elaborate depiction of Shiva, who is not a God, not even an extraordinary human, but the head of a simple tribe of cattle herders, somewhere in the foot of the Himalayas, ridden with fatigue due to incessant struggles for existence being fought with the other tribes. His assistant, comrade and best pal, curiously, is a fellow tribesman called Nandi. Due to the course of events, Shiva and his tribe migrate to Meluha, the land of Suryavanshis, the descendants of the illustrious Lord Rama. The land of the Suryavanshis is plagued with many evils, and is under threat from the opposite race, the Chandravanshis. To add to their already cup-full of woes, the Chandravanshis have employed the despicable, sinister Nagas, an ostracized caste, to spread terror in the land of Meluhans.It is from these terrors that the Meluhans seek respite. According to the Meluhan legend, it will be 'Neelkanth', the one whose neck will turn blue on drinking their nectar, Somaras, who will be their Savior. Thus is defined the character and course of the protagonist, Shiva, who after drinking the Somaras is hailed by the hapless people as their Lord, the one who will alleviate all evils from their land. What then ensues is the journey of Shiva through the land of Meluhans, during which, he establishes himself as a warrior of unparalleled might and war skills. At most places during the narrative, Shiva is shown to be spellbound by the superior technology and infrastructure possessed by the inhabitants of the magnificent land of Meluha. Also, as an undercurrent, laced into the narrative is the love story of our"

1117,"The Lost World (Jurassic Park, #2)",0752224417,Michael Crichton,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"First off, this is an extremely beautiful copy of both Jurassic Park and The Lost World. The pages are significantly thinner than that of their original prints, which is perfectly acceptable since both novels were bound together. 
Now onto the biggest problem: the red on the cover bleeds. BADLY.
It pains me to say I had to retire this copy to the shelves only after 2 weeks of having it. The red ink used on the cover can get loosened up if  you hold the book in your hand, or if you position it in your lap, and touching it will smear the ink all over the white leather and get all over your fingers. With this, I am extremely disappointed. 
Other wise, if you're going to buy it to complete or expand your B&amp;N Leatherbounds, or to buy it for your Jurassic Park collection, then by all means, do. Though, the only way I would suggest reading this is on a table without touching the covers."
1117,"The Lost World (Jurassic Park, #2)",0752224417,Michael Crichton,Barnes and Noble,4.6,SusanVT,I do love Michael Crichton and I looked forward to receiving it. About half way through the book I noticed that my fingers were red and saw that the red on the cover and back was running.  A disappointment for sure.
1117,"The Lost World (Jurassic Park, #2)",0752224417,Michael Crichton,Barnes and Noble,4.6,OzarksGB,"I was about to leave Barnes and Noble last night and turned my head and saw this....and knew immediately I was buying it.  This edition of the novels is amazingly done.  The cover is perfect......it keeps with the color scheme and simplicity of the original releases of Jurassic Park and The Lost World, but has a new designed look, which I love.  Whoever designed the cover....you're awesome!  The pages are also lined in silver which makes this edition even more impressive looking.  

I have a first edition of Jurassic Park and The Lost World, and this was still a must-buy.  I would have paid the $20 price for just one of these novels done in this way.  If you haven't read Jurassic Park or The Lost World, you are missing some of Michael Crichton's best work.  And if you've just seen the movies, you're missing a lot of story to Jurassic Park....and you're not even touching The Lost World.  The movie is NOTHING like the novel! 

Needless to say, I highly recommend this.  

Thank you Barnes and Noble!!!!"
1118,"Requiem (Delirium, #3)",0062014536,Lauren Oliver,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Anonymous,"If you like to have a solid conclusion without open ends, dont read this book.  The first two books were AMAZING and to end the trilogy like this is an insult."
1118,"Requiem (Delirium, #3)",0062014536,Lauren Oliver,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Anonymous,I endured pages and pages of Alex being an immature baby for this? Is this some Giver rip off ending? I wasted twleve bucks and hours of reading to be told to bring my walls down? Can ypu say cliched? Oliver should have taken her time to give this trilogy the ending it deserved. The ending is insulting and she is going to have to write a fourth novel just as Lowry ended up eventually doing. This book is an insult to the reader and the characters. Honestly we expect more.
1118,"Requiem (Delirium, #3)",0062014536,Lauren Oliver,Barnes and Noble,3.5,lovely2seeU,"I remember the first review i wrote for Delirium back in 2011, back then, i was completely hooked and totally invested in the book, the plot, the characters. 
Everything. It is one of those books that I think will always stick with me because of how refreshing the storyline is..how strange it was to think about a world where love was considered as a disease.
I couldnt wait to find out how it all ended.

Requiem was a good book, but I felt like there was a lot of things that were left unsaid. Since I'm trying to keep this review spoiler free I will try not to bring up exact examples of things
 that happened in the book to prove my point however, I will say that I did feel like there were a few characters from the first book who just...went away in this one. Which yes, is understandable since a lot has changed since then,
but I felt like since these characters had such big parts in the first book  they would at least deserve to get a proper ending, not just some vague story fed by one character while leaving the rest to our imagination.

I've actually just forced myself to delete some parts of this review because I really dont want to spoil anyone although there is so much I want to get off my chest. A lot of things pissed me off in this book and despite the fact that I DID enjoy it,
 I still do think it could have gone in a completely different (less depressing) direction. 

The ending was just......again, vague. It was a kind of &quot;who knows whay will happen now&quot; kind of ending and I hate those so much. 
There are times when its suitable but this was not one of those, too much stuff had happened for it to come down to a so-so ending is frustrating."
1119,"A Crown of Swords (Wheel of Time, #7)",0812550285,Robert Jordan,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"This was a great book. In the previous books, Jordan touched lightly on the relationship between Lan and Nynaeve. Finally, they have gotten married. I was also curious as to how things would fall out between Min and Rand and also Elayne and Avendia. This book reaches deeper into topics it had touched only lightly before.   I have heard many complain that the time between the books is too long and I do agree, but I do ask one question. Can a man right a 900 page book, get it revised over and over again and get it all published in less than a year like everyone wants? Just a small question. :-)"

1121,"Blood Meridian, or the Evening Redness in the West",0679728759,Cormac McCarthy,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"This was my first McCarthy.  I suspect that like others I came to it at the recommendation of Harold Bloom, of whom I am a sort of disciple. (For the record, Bloom does not say that this is the 'best American novel in 50 years¿', instead he says that BM is the 'greatest aesthetic achievement of any American novelist in 50 years.' Bloom, as usual, has chosen his words carefully.)  And despite Bloom's valid enthusiasm, McCarthy is a true if still only slightly inferior inheritor of Joyce and Conrad via Faulkner, as well as of Hemmingway, Melville, Twain and perhaps Whitman.  Upon first glance at the text, one is reminded of Faulkner at his most desperately purple and Joycean. Deeper one sees Hemingway's mechanics and structure and use of Spanish dialog, as well as Whitman¿s¿ and Stevens' taste for a wide and unusual vocabulary. (Judge Holden in the preacher's camp, falsely exposing the preacher as a phony is pure Poldy in Nighttown.)  'Phantasmagoric', found in the text, is an appropriate adjective for BM.  Set in the 1850s in Texas and Mexico, it follows the hypergrotesque (I'm still not sure that word is strong enough) odyssey of the the Kid, an orphan who enlists with the Glanton gang, a pack of wretched mercenaries hunting Apache scalps for bounty. As such BM is 350 pages of nightmare bloodletting, all written by an author whose powers of naturalistic description are fearless and masterful and apparently bottomless. It all takes quite a toll, since it leaves few places for the reader to rest.  McCarthy evinces none of the anxiety that propels his precursors, like Melville, to let some light slip out and betray hope-- and that, all moralizing aside, may be the novel's only real flaw. Howevermuch the first few pages of BM might resemble the first few of Moby Dick with its invitations to 'See' and then proceed to lead us sleepily into a mad and bloody epic, BM will not suffer an Ishmael to tell his dreamy tale.  When we do get to rest from the decapitations and disembowelings in BM, it's in a space of Kafkan absurdity, a Beckett-like vacuum of absence of meaning, or thankfully (!) in the anti-Dostoevskian philosophizings of Judge Holden, who is the true center, anti-center, of the novel, something more than superficially like Moby Dick's white whale. That the reader is placed in such a desperate space, however, and that we must sit by the fire and somehow be glad for (and rightfully terrified of) Holden is clearly the novel's greatest strength. Holden, perhaps the Devil himself, whose real interest among the Glanton gang is in the Kid, in whom he sees something redeeming that he cannot let be, is a charming and gentlemanly renaissance man who also happens to be an abyss of negation and destruction, an albino giant Old Scratch whose principle of being/non-being is that 'War is God'. The novel is emotionally taxing and frustrating, and it has its major aesthetic flaws (also inherited from Faulkner and Twain: Faulkner when the rhetoric unintentionally mocks itself-- but that is rare since the writing is so controlled and taut--, and on a large scale like Twain in Huck Finn, when BM seems to go off the rails about 3/4 of the way through),  but it is a must for any serious reader of American novels."
1121,"Blood Meridian, or the Evening Redness in the West",0679728759,Cormac McCarthy,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"First, be warned, this story is not for the faint of heart. That aside, it is probably one of the most beautiful and monstrous books I've come across in recent memory. The juxstaposition of considerably luscious descriptives for an austere backdrop alongside stomach turning violence with an equally existential/fatalistic twist to the characters is such an exciting dichotomy. The book is one that stays with you. It can evoke some serious reactions- that's not only rare in my opinion, but prized. Cormac McCarthy is one of my favorites and of his work this is, in my opinion, his epitome."
1121,"Blood Meridian, or the Evening Redness in the West",0679728759,Cormac McCarthy,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"I have known about this book for over 15 years and have looked for other resources related to this book to help deepen my appreciation for the genius of Cormac McCarthy.  I recently stumbled across a new tool on John Sepich's website - a complete concordance of 'Blood Meridian'.  The breakdown of McCarthy's word choices and variety will blow your mind.  After spending some time on the site, I am going to go back and re-read this book.  I am sure that it is going to be even more intriguing now than previous reads."
1122,"Finale (Hush, Hush, #4)",1442426675,Becca Fitzpatrick,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Luvmyhootie,"I don't think I have ever felt this profound sense of finality before while reading a book. Not since reading the final book in The Hunger Games trilogy (Mockingjay) have I felt this way. Like I don't know what to do now that this series is over. Now all of a sudden all I can hear in my head is Celine Dion's song &quot;Where does my heart beat now&quot;.

My best friends got me hooked on Hush Hush, and it was so good it sparked a deep love of reading in me that I still haven't been able to quench.

Finale starts off where Silence finished. Nora having sworn to Hank (The Black Hand) that she would lead his Nephilim army or she would forfeit her life and the life of her mother if she failed. Patch and Nora have to keep their relationship a secret so they don't upset the Nephilim but at the same time Nora has to keep her bargain with the Archangels to bring peace. I don't think I have been so nervous while reading a book EVER! I thought about just reading on the toilet because I knew eventually this book would lead me there! After having gone through all the ups and downs with Patch and Nora as we did in the first 3 books, this one sure does top all of the others for most suspenseful. I tried so hard to figure out which way the story was going to go, but every time I did it would veer off into another direction. I was second guessing EVERY. SINGLE. CHARACTER. You couldn't help it, everyone is a suspect (or so says the authorities.) 

The most shocking moment I absolutely DID NOT see coming involved a beloved character. I can't believe as many times as I have read this series I didn't see this coming! To some it might not be a surprise but to me it was and THAT gave to story a whole new punch! 

This book made me cry, and that almost NEVER happens! I mean the book has to be pretty darn drastic for me to start crying. (That should tell you a little about this book all by itself) I was beside myself with grief over a particular scene I also didn't see coming, but I won't divulge the details due to spoilers. This was one of the hardest books to read because it isn't easy to continue with a lump in your throat and tears in your eyes. It doesn't end on a sad note though. The conclusion was well done and beautifully bittersweet giving what the readers of this series craved most. Finality. I am so glad I stumbled onto this series and even though it is over I know it will stay with me for a long time to come."

1123,Skeleton Crew,0751504386,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.1,geekjane,"Reading a Palahniuk novel is like watching a David Lynch movie written by a more literary Howard Stern: completely off the wall, usually mildly offensive and nearly impossible to dismiss. Certainly not for the conservative or oversensitive, his novels are incredibly intricate, smart and darkly funny. The movie Fight Club  has generated a huge amount of success and cult following, and that was based on a Chuck Palahniuk novel. I really enjoyed reading Lullaby  and would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoyed watching Fight Club or another film adaptation based on Palahniuk's other novel Choke.


The basic summary (if you could even make one short enough to call it a summary) is all centering around a culling song, or lullaby that has the power to kill a person after you sing it to them. Carl Streator is a journalist investigating SIDS or sudden infant death syndrome and he's not coming up with new explanations until he happens upon this culling poem and it's correlating presence at each victims family home. Once he discovers the truth behind the tragic deaths he embarks on a journey of destruction and discovery with the colorful and powerful Helen Hover Boyle, that will change his life and the world forever.


I love the descriptions of the characters in the book. They are each so colorful and eccentric that you really start to care for them no matter how much more vile and corrupt they become. It is difficult to compare Palahniuk's style to any other authors because it honestly is more like it's own language. He is probably the author that influenced me the most to want to be a writer. Something about how he is able to mix fascinating story with his own views and opinions really inspired me. I am going to try and read another Palahniuk book called Diary next and then possibly will read Invisible Monsters which is set to be made into a film later this year."

His books are original and spectacular and while you know his writing style, you never quite know what you're getting yourself into when you start reading one of his books. Not surprisingly, Lullaby is no different. Lullaby is one of those books that you'll think about over and over again, not quite knowing why. It's not a bad thing, though, because you're reminded of how you felt when you read it. Chuck is an awesomely creative (and probably crazy) artist. Chuck is the man."

A story about a Punjabi boy and Tamil girl bridging the gap between North and South India and overcoming all the cultural differences that prejudice their families before uniting as one. It's a short novel, crisp and very Indian. Reminiscent of what lots of young people in India go through today. It is note-worthy that it is the younger generation that helps the older generation get over past prejudices and traditions that harm the society or individual. Said to be something of an autobiography, the plot moves smoothly enough, taking the readers from Ahmedabad to Delhi to Chennai to Delhi and back and forth these two cities poles apart in India. The language is full of Indianisms, and there is plenty of situational based humour - one is familiar with the sort of drama the young couple constantly find themselves in. While the book is a pleasant read it isn't particularly anything to write home about. It's just the sort of book one might want to take on a bus journey for some light reading."

Story:            Yuki's earliest memory is of a stormy night in winter, wherein she was attacked by a vampire... And then rescued by another. Now 10 years later, Yuki Cross, the adopted daughter of the headmaster of Cross Academy, has grown up and become a guardian of the vampire race, protecting her savior, Kaname, from discovery as he leads a group of vampires at the elite boarding school. But also at her side is Zero Kiryu, a childhood friend who's hatred for the creatures that destroyed everything he held dear, is now determined never to trust them. This coexisting arrangement seems all well and good, but have the vampires truly renounced their murderous ways, or is there a darker truth behind their actions. Is Kaname's infatuation with Yuki the beginning of a forbidden romance, or is it something in her forgotten past that draws him to her. Because in this world of secrets, nothing is as it seems. And the price of misplaced trust may even be worse than death."

1126,"Vampire Knight, Vol. 1 (Vampire Knight, #1)",1421508222,"Matsuri Hino, Tomo Kimura",Barnes and Noble,4.5,MicheleLeesBookLove,"The previous book in the series, Grave Peril, was the kind of book a fan reads just to find out what's happening next with the characters, so it was with some caution that I picked up my copy of Summer Knight. I was, honestly, afraid that the momentum and pure fun Butcher whipped up in the first two Harry Dresden books was destined to only make for a slow, disappointing slide.

And I was very wrong, thankfully.

In Summer Knight Butcher hits that perfect stride between adventure, mystery, a touch of romance and plenty of humor that was off in Grave Peril. It opens with Dresden, nearly mad and driven to his own destruction over the tragedy that befell his girlfriend Susan in the last book, investigating a literal rain of toads at a Chicago park. While there Dresden barely escapes a hit, aided by a werewolf buddy, and returns home to meet a would-be client. Only the client turns out to be none other than the Winter Queen of the Fairies, who has bought his debt to his fairie godmother and in return wants three favors from him.

The first, which he is told he has full permission to decline, is to seek out the true killer of the knight of the Summer court, clearing the Winter Queen's name. But while still considering whether he'll take the task or not Dresden meets with the White Council, part of which is trying to blame him for starting the war between wizards and the Red Court of vampires. The Winter Queen, the Council finds, is willing to give the wizards aid in their fight against the vampires, if Dresden completes a task for them. Conveniently enough the White Council, less friendly than Harry would like to admit to, demands that he fulfill the Winter Queen's task as he never did have a proper quest to become a full wizard in the first place. The quest will kill two birds with one stone, if it doesn't kill Harry first.

Only the quest isn't as simple as find the killer, something neither the White Council nor the Winter Queen (or even the Summer Queen) realize is going on, and Harry, the only one who can find the truth, is facing a full on Fairie War as well as a magical imbalance of the seasons that could rip the mortal world apart. 

As always Dresden is in over his head, but is stubborn, sarcastic and determined to do what is right by the people around him, the people who depend on him one way or the other.

Summer Knight comes together with smoothness and wholeness that Grave Peril lacked. The stakes are just as high, the losses potentially just as bad, but the parts all fit together in a way that makes this addition to the Dresden Files an incredibly satisfying read."

*Book source ~ Purchased at Audible

Harry Dresden, Wizard Extraordinaire and Private Investigator is in the dumps because his girlfriend has left town to deal with the after effects of being bitten by a Red Court vampire. He needs to get his act together because he needs money for rent and everyday living, but instead the Winter Queen walks into his office and offers him a job he can&rsquo;t refuse. He has to find the real killer of the Summer Queen&rsquo;s Summer Knight and clear her name or the two Faerie Courts will go to war. In exchange for doing this one little (yeah, right) thing for her she will grant the White Council passage through her realm while they fight their own war with the Red Court. Oh, and she has taken over his debt to his godmother which means he now owes Mab the debt. Harry has to find a killer, prevent a war that would destroy most of mankind, win safe passage for the White Council and pay off his new debt with the Winter Queen. All in a days work for Chicago&rsquo;s only wizard.

This series continues to entertain the kids (and me). We all love Harry. The humor is a big hit still, the magic is always interesting and the mystery keeps us guessing.

Many favorite characters are back such as Bob, Murphy, the Alphas, Thomas, Michael and Toot-Toot. In addition to meeting many of the Fae and some Changelings we met Elaine, Harry&rsquo;s very first love and who he thought was dead. Surprise! We also got to meet many of the White Council and more importantly the wizards of the Senior Council including Ebenezer McCoy who took Harry in when he was a teenager and was his mentor.

Everyone liked the battle with the troll and the Chlorofiend at Walmart and it was unanimous that the big battle at the end was awesome. Everyone enjoyed all of the information pertaining to the Faerie Courts. They did not like many of the Fae, but then who does? The loved meeting the Senior Council. They were very surprised at who killed the Summer Knight.

Favorite quote: &ldquo;I stretched out my hand, adrenaline and pain giving me plenty of fuel for the magic, and called, 'Ventas servitas!' Wind leapt out in a sudden spurt, seizing the Unraveling and tearing it from Aurora's fingers, sending it spinning through the air toward me. I caught it, stuck my tongue out at Aurora, yelled, 'Meep, meep!' and ran like hell.&rdquo; 

Narration: Marsters is improving as the series goes along. He&rsquo;s done a much better job in this one than in previous ones though his pronunciations sometimes aren&rsquo;t quite right."

Another brilliant CoHo book. And before that? All of her other books. And prior to that? Probably a Harry Potter book.

this--something she's never done with her other stories. I'm tough, I said.  I won't breakdown, I affirmed while doing the downward 
dog yoga move in my imagination. Besides, if she didn't cry while writing Holder and Sky's story, UGLY LOVE can't be *that* sad.  
Oh, boy. Was I wrong. So, so deliciously wrong.

This story is told both in present and past tense through alternating point of views. A highly effective method of writing in this case 
because we get to see the loving, caring side of Miles that Tate suspects is underneath his shell of indifference.  But, why? What 
could have possibly happened to transform the young man that would qualify as the best boyfriend ever into a man that doesn't allow 
himself to feel darn near anything any more? Hang tight. You'll find out and I'm going to go as far as saying...your life as a reader will

But....
The book is almost always better than the movie. Almost. There has never been a time in my life when I have found a movie better than it's book. I think I just found an exception. For example: Roux and Vienne's relationship. In the movie, it was perfect. In the book.....it was a one night stand. Where was the magic? Where was the beauty? Where   was the love? Uggh! That really disappointed me. Maybe in the next book, they will redeem themselves, but until then....
Also, in the movie, there's more drama. Not so much that it's ridiculous, but enough to make you reach out to the characters. Like in the boat scene. While watching the movie, I really felt for Vienne, and was genuinely scared for Anouk. It made the characters more real. But in the book, they didn't have as much of that. I'll give Joanne props for Charly and Guillame, but as for everyone else...I don't know.  It just didn't have as much as an impact on me as the movie. 
But hey, don't let me curve you're thinking. The book beautifully crafted. There was a lot of thought and creativity that went into it. And without it, I wouldn't have an amazing movie to compare it to."

A pilot standing in the wreckage of his plane, his leather helmet in flames...that image alone was enough to hook me into this finely crafted story.  Ondaatje should be credited with telling more than just one excellent story in this novel, but many.  The narrative pieces about Kip are excellent and he becomes a character that I wish Ondaatje would write about in a whole other novel just about him.  Also, the English Patient himself with The Histories of Herodotus will be a character that remains in my memory for a long time...that book with his clippings and inserts...his relationship with Katharine...his life as enigmatic and capable of burying details and events as the desert which he loves.

However, it seems the story did map the characters from one space to another, and made it an intricating multidimension. The story is well-plotted.  Hana is not the main character, but the English patient is. In some sense to him, Hana is probably an image (or 'ghost') of Katherine, so reminds him in his memory. But, what two different characters between Hana and Katherine, and what two different loves they give a man!  The story is so far from the philosophy that is commonly adopted for life. But, compared to those, I feel this one is so condensed that romances in other forms are just as vain, and I wish I could find why a person will choose a love like this. In the end, I have to admit, it is a true love, brief but lasting forever."

I really wanted to read this novel after Gabriel's Inferno and find out how things transpired between Gabriel and Julianne. The novel picks up directly after the first one, the morning after they arrive in Italy. Julia and Gabriel spend two glorious weeks in Italy, where they grow to love each other more and more. Once they return to Toronto however, things take a downward spiral. Not only is Christa using all her tricks to try and sabotage Gabriel and Julia's relationship, she is now aiming to have Gabriel fired and make sure that Julia never attains her dreams of going to Harvard and becoming a future professor. On top of that, Gabriel must contend with Paulina, the mother of his child and former drug addict/girlfriend. To save Julia, Gabriel must sacrifice what he holds most dear and hope that Julia will forgive him...

What I Liked: Hmmmm I liked that Sylvain Reynard added another layer of obstacles for Julia and Gabriel to overcome as well as made his sacrifice so great and so painful, not only for himself, but for Julia and everyone around them: Paul, Tom, Rachel, Scott. The novel was very, very sweet and the love Gabriel gives Julia is a love that only appears once in a lifetime and is a love of legendary proportions.

What I Didn't Like: Julia...seriously?? Give the man some credit! Stop crying about yourself and your troubles and cut Gabriel some slack. Sheesh! Everything Gabriel does, he does for the betterment of Julia and her future and he tells her that All.The.TIME! So it's not too hard to infer that Gabriel had to make sacrifices to ensure that Julia could make her dreams come true. Julia should have been way more grateful for what Gabriel did for her rather than going on and on about being equals in the relationship and making her own decisions and errors. And Gabriel even asked her later, along the lines of 'would you have let me do it if you knew?' and she said no. Good Lord. Julia, be grateful for such a wonderful man.

I didn't have as strong of an emotional attachment to this one unfortunately, so I give it 3.5 stars."

1134,"Gabriel's Rapture (Gabriel's Inferno, #2)",1936305550,Sylvain Reynard,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"Dublin at the turn of the nineteenth century is this book's source of inspiration. Joyce here captures a sense of sadness, a sense of folly, and a sense of unsatisfaction in this collection of short stories. Fourteen were intended by Joyce for The Dubliners, and in this Bantom Books Reprint, the lyrically written, but awkwardly structured 'The Dead' has been included (it reads in two seemingly incongruent parts). My notables include 'A Mother', 'A Little Cloud', and 'Counterparts'. 'The Dead' is hailed by the literati as a great piece, and the second half of the story captures the distance that can occur in a marriage, the effects of a perceived affair on a husband and a woman's longing for what could have been if she'd married differently.    This collection of stories is compulsory for any James Joyce reader, as it is a sharp contrast in style to Finnegan's Wake or Ulysses.    I find the value in it, if one wants to be absolutely immersed in a different time and place, and read some passionately painful, realistic stories. The morals of these stories can be interpreted open-endedly, like most great art, and at times may be too subtle for the modern reader.    One drawback to this edition. Shame on Bantam for not presenting the punctuation as Joyce intended. He originally demarcates his changed in dialogue with dashes, rather than standard quotation mark indicators. What is the point of reading the book how the author did not intend it read? Read the book, but choose an edition true to the author's intent."

My personal favorite story is 'The Dead' which is Joyce's transition from his more simplistic writing into what will later become his stream of conciousness and deeply imbedded symbolism style of writing that we see in Ulysses. I recommend this to anyone. Some of the short stories are easier to read than others, but there shouldn't be any great trouble in any of them. Each story has its unique beauty and truth about the human race."

It¿s a smashing book, when you are done with it you understand why people do stupid things, drink excessively or gamble (the reasoning behind it).     	This book is a benchmark in literary competence that everyone should read. I love this book because it gives the perspective of the lower class of Dublin children skipping school, alcoholics exedra. James Joyce has exceeded the expectations for word choice of the finest writers. It is a book of short, stories each chapter gives a different perspective of the same day in Dublin. 	    	James Joyce also wrote the Odyssey which by many standards is the hardest book to understand (in English) and is legendary for its complexity.

The invocations of 9/11 are exceedingly and wisely spare, as McCann allows the tales, and the truth and resonance of the walk, to speak for themselves. The ultimate triumph of the novel, though, is the scenes of the tightrope walker, including his practices in the snow. They are unforgettable, poetic as they are precise."

By Eoin Colfer

Artemis Fowl:The Eternity Code is a great book. It combines fantasy with action and suspense. It's mainly about the fairy civilization, and how one boy's actions threaten the survival of it.

Artemis Fowl, a very intelligent and bright child, lives in a manor near Munich, Ireland. However, he is very different from other children. In fact, he is the only human in the world who knows about the existence of ""The fairy people"".   With this information, he manages to steal some fairy technology, which is far ahead of ours. Then, using the fairy technology he manages to build a small, but powerful super computer called the C-Cube. This computer not only contains human devices, but also valuable fairy information as well, making it dangerous in the hands of another human who might use the fairy information to destroy the civilization.  Another human, Jon Spiro, eventually learns of the computer's existence. He steals it from Artemis, after Artemis offers to sell it to him for 20 billion dollars. In order to protect the fairy civilization, Artemis and a fairy squad go on a brave adventure in order to steal back the C-Cube. Will Artemis and his team successfully steal the C-Cube? Or will Jon Spiro use the computer to wipe out the fairy civilization? READ THE BOOK YOURSELF AND FIND OUT!!!!!!


Artemis Fowl:The Eternity Code is excellent in my opinion. Artemis must learn from his mistakes and make the right choices throughout the book. Although it is classified as a fantasy book, it really is part thriller too. I'd recommend the book to anyone who enjoys fantasy, action, or both."
1137,"The Eternity Code (Artemis Fowl, #3)",0141321318,Eoin Colfer,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"Harlan Coben's ""Tell No One"" is a thrilling story that keeps tension high and anticipation even higher. After Dr. David Beck's wife was murdered, he was devistated. Eight years later, new evidence is found and new secrets are exposed that lead him to believe she might not be dead after all. That sure is the way it sounds from the strange emails he recieves that contain information only his beloved Elizabeth would know. Suspence is definately not lacking as the twists and turns become more suprising and more original the farther into the novel you get. Coben's style of writing tends to get confusing at times because of his use of perspective and time. He jumps abruptly from setting to setting and from different people's point of view. This strategy could be looked at as confusing, or helpful to the intensity and suspence, as i thought it did. This novel shows how unconditional and everlasting love can truely be, how evil the effects of fate can be, and that the impossible is always probable.  I would, without a doubt, reccommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good thrill and a truely original story. Enjoy!"

Hex Hall is a boarding school for magical creatures and beings in need of a little more training and lots of rules. Other inmates include werewolves, shapeshifters, faeries, and one vampire who happens to be Sophie's new roommate and the one girl everyone loves to hate.

Jenna loves pink and seems sweet, but there's a dangerous rumor floating around about her and the death of a girl last year.

Sophie's not sure who to trust, but despite rumors, she becomes fast friends with Jenna while crushing over the hottest boy in school - and gaining his girlfriend as an enemy.

When another girl is attacked, everyone wants the truth. Did a coven of witches raise a demon? Could a ghost from Sophie's past be more powerful than she suspects? Are the vampires really responsible for these attacks? Either way, the truth must come out...

Rachel Hawkins writes a perfect debut novel filled with paranormal creatures, a dark mystery, a deep, strange society, and one hot guy. This start of a new series left me breathless with anticipation for the next installment."
1140,"Hex Hall (Hex Hall, #1)",1423121309,Rachel Hawkins,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"I read the original post done by Austin Kleon a few years back and loved the ideas that he presented, so when I heard that there was going to be a book, I was estatic! Of course, I immediately had to preorder it for my nook. I also took a look at the book in paperback at my local B&N, and after some thought, I came up with some of its strong point - and one of its weakest.

All of the content was exactly what I was hoping to see. Not only was there a reiteration of the information in the original blog post, but there was also new information that I was happy to see. His examples made a lot of sense and the diction was great. The only complaint I would have would be that I wished it was longer - I didn't want to stop reading, yet I finished it in about an hour! That was disappointing, but that is minor considering the obvious time and effort put into the content and ideas.

I LOVED the pictures in the book! The white handwriting on black background will forever remind me of this book. It's a very simple thing, yes, but I believe it made a huge different. It stood out!

Sadly, the formatting in the e-book version of this was not exactly stellar. It was perfect in the paperback; there wasn't any space wasted, for sure! But I didn't get the same feel with the e-book, and I'm not sure if that's because it's simply too complicated to program it better or not. Mostly it was just that all the pictures were on separate pages with no other text for the most part, and the opening two pages in the paperback had to be compressed into one (you'll understand what I mean if you compare them). I understand that sometimes something that seems so simple can be a headache to put together in a computer program, but it really bothered me. Other than that, about three times while reading, it glitched and wouldn't let me go to the next page, meaning I had to jump ahead with the go to buttons. This, I hope, would be easily fixed; I had this preordered and just read it, so it's natural for there to be some glitches.

Overall, this was a G-R-E-A-T book! I loved everything that was shared and the cohesiveness with which Kleon explained his thoughts, and applying them to my own life, I can see the sense it makes for an artist to emulate their heroes. Despite the formatting issues within the e-book and the short book altogether, I think that what Kleon has presented is a thoughtful, informative, and awesome collaborations of ideas. Great job, Kleon! I recommend this book to anybody who is an artistic soul!"

Steal begins with David Bowie's admission that ""The only art I'll ever study is stuff that I can steal from'; gathers steam with Yohji Yamamoto's advice to ""Start copying what you love.

Along the way, Kleon leads us through his 10 thoughts on the theme of unlocking our creativity.

The writing of Neal Stephenson is absolutely second to none. It is intelligent, dense, and full of metaphors that make one laugh out loud. It also traverses multiple timelines in a compelling fashion. The characters are unforgettable -- similar to those found in Catch-22, these characters will be with me forever.

If you are into straightforward plots, do not like tangential meanderings about the mathematics behind one's sexual drive, and are not at all interested in technology, then this book is definitely not for you.

Rating: 3




The Low Down: Girl getting her MBA interns as assistant to gorgeous a*hole. Hate/love and hot n heavy sex ensues. Will both parties be redeemed or crash and burn?




Much like people didn&rsquo;t pick up (sorry, I have to mention it) Fifty Shades of Grey to read about the life of a soon-to-graduate college student, I imagine many aren't reading this for its tips on getting an MBA. I don&rsquo;t know what happened in the last year or so, but it looks like all that red wine we&rsquo;re drinking isn&rsquo;t going to waste. Real grown-up ladies are wanting to read something with, uh, a little more sumthin&rsquo; sumthin&rsquo;, if you know what I am saying. If you don&rsquo;t know what I am saying, then what I am saying is graphic sex. Red wine = red blood?




Call me a purist, but whatever graphic-ness is involved, I still want my book to be written well. It&rsquo;s hard enough (stop it) to read all of the silly verbs and adjectives in erotica without rolling my eyes; I don&rsquo;t want a total hot mess of a book on top of that (uh sorry). I would go to great lengths (ignore that) to keep from reading something that ultimately left me high and dry (seriously?) in the story line department.




Beautiful Bastard plants its Prada loafers right in the middle of the proverbial road. Those of you who picked it up more for the action won&rsquo;t be disappointed (get it in eBook form so you can bookmark those pages that you enjoy most). For those of you who, like me, prefer a little more heft, you may want to get your favorite romance and write your own scenes (You're a naughty minx, Miss Bennet!). For those of you who have no desire to rewrite literature,  I will say that the story takes over in the second half of the book. The sex parts don&rsquo;t peter out (ignore that, too), but it&rsquo;s clear that the authors wanted to make this a real story.




In all honesty, I don't know how to properly review a book of this nature. How seriously does the writing matter if your blood is pumping and heart rate is accelerating? I can only treat it like any other book that I review, I guess. Some people may just call this porn, but there is a difference between porn and erotica. My definition would be that erotica is much better written and is concerned with the story as well as the sex. Some may say that any graphic sex makes it porn. To-MAY-to, to-MAH-to.




The tried-and-true romance tale formula is used, you know where the two main characters hate each other at first? It works here just fine, too. The bottom line: this is a book that isn&rsquo;t too big for its La Perlas; you get what you came for.




Beautiful Bastard by Christina Lauren was published February 12, 2013 by Gallery Books. A free copy of this book was given to Ink and Page in return for an honest review. Big thanks to NetGalley, Gallery Books and the Mses. Christina and Lauren.

1142,Cryptonomicon,0060512806,Neal Stephenson,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Hesperia_Loves_Books,"I was a little apprehensive to start this book.  I wasn&rsquo;t sure how I would like yet another Twilight fanfic turned novel.  I&rsquo;m not sure why, especially since I loved Fifty.  I guess my issue is that I didn&rsquo;t want to see the parallels and comparisons with Twilight, I wanted something that was able to stand on it&rsquo;s own. I got that and more with this book!  Everything about Beautiful Bastard is a win for me.  The cover is edgy, smart, sexy and screams read me (does anyone else see Adam Levine when they look at the cover?).  Once I started reading, I was captivated with and enthralled by Bennett &amp; Chloe&rsquo;s story!   Their chemistry leapt off the page, and had me desperately wanting more with every page that I turned.

From the minute that Chloe meets Bennett, sparks fly.  Their attraction is instant but becomes buried in their overwhelming dislike and hatred for the other.  She has worked at Ryan Media Group for six years, but nine months ago Bennett arrived, and things haven&rsquo;t been the same since.  Having to work for him directly, she soon finds out that under the amazingly sexy surface, he is arrogant, condescending and questions every decision she makes.  What I found extremely refreshing about Chloe&rsquo;s character is her strength and attitude.  She is not meek or mild-mannered, she does not stand idly by while Bennett railroads her and she gives, just as good as she gets.    She is a smart &amp; savvy businesswoman who knows exactly what she wants, even if she won&rsquo;t admit to herself that it&rsquo;s Bennett.

Bennett doesn&rsquo;t want to want Chloe.  However, his attraction to her begins to overpower every other feeling he has.  When he tries to fight it, he becomes an even bigger ***hole, which only makes it worse.  Their lust is fueled by their hate and pretty soon it implodes in the conference room after work.  After the explosive sex, they agree that it was a one time shot. How wrong they were!

From cover to cover this book was fantastic.  While I loved the characters strong personalities, banter, arguments and altercations; the best parts of the book were when they brought down their walls and showed each other their weaknesses and vulnerabilities.  It was then that their relationship started to develop and take off.  Behind all that hatred was a love that needed to breathe and grow.  After starting off a little sluggish, by the end of the book I was left wanting tons more of Chloe &amp; Bennett.  They are fabulous together and I can&rsquo;t wait to see what the future holds for them."

Her best book by far it ""The Poisonwood Bible"" which I have read several times. But this book is totaly disappointing. She has three female characters who are so much alike that they are practically identical. She gets on her soapbox and lectures and preaches page after page...chapter after chapter..about the evils of nonorganic farming and killing wolves. OK...fine by me. But over 300 pages of that doesn't make a story and never will. Then...when you think the story is FINALLY going somewhere (around page 315 or so) she just stops. Like she ran out of paper!

In We Were the Mulvaneys, Oates creates an idyllic family with a peaceful, happy life, and depicts the family members¿ simultaneous demises after Marianne, their daughter, is raped at a party after prom. As the Mulvaneys fall from their previous social standing and each undergo personal struggles involving recovery and justice, Oates touches on all aspects of family issues. From alcoholism, to violence, depression, anxiety, and separation, she leaves absolutely nothing out. The effect is a book that will ¿Break your heart, heal it, then break it again,¿ as a reviewer from the Los Angeles Times Book Review put it. Though it¿s not a book to read on a sunny day when you¿re in a good mood, We Were the Mulvaneys is honest, insightful, and powerful. It will make you think about the connections between family members in ways you never have before."

Thats how the story started, and thats exactly what caught me because no, I did not know them, but simply by asking, it made me think that they were supposedly well-known.   I read this book when I was 15, and again now, 2 years later, and am also doing a research paper on Joyce Carol Oates and actually set up an interview with her, since she's only half an hour away in Princeton.  WE WERE THE MULVANEYS was one of the best books I've ever read. The characters were so vivid and so many experiences were displayed so that the reader knew each character well, as if known personally, so that when the downfall of the Mulvaney family- a prosperous, popular family- occurs, it leaves the reader so moved and upset.   And that is what great writing is."
1145,We Were the Mulvaneys,0452282829,Joyce Carol Oates,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Major_Kelly,McCloud has written a perfect primer on the nature of art itself. How does art work? What is art? How do artists make artistic choices? What are the limits of art? How do you tell a story? McCloud's book is a fascinating primer. It would make a good textbook for an Art 101 class.
1145,We Were the Mulvaneys,0452282829,Joyce Carol Oates,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"Scott McCloud is thorough in his research, elevating comics from their misconceived 'rubbish' to their rightful respect of 'juxtaposed pictorial  and other images in deliberate sequence.' It broadens the minds, while discouraging empty unoriginal creations.  The book included: how our ancestors enjoyed comics, how it grew to be what it was 'termed', why there is such a strong bond between the reader and the abstract story on whatever medium, what happens in between the panels and how time is viewed, techniques used to fully live in the moment, how one goes about creating comics, and how they fit.    It wasn't enough just to talk about comics. Scott McCloud let us enjoy them through the entire book as references, examples and in whatever sentence throughout the book. I highly recommend it. Not for comic addicts but for people with limited attention span, and those who need to break out of the typical book."
1145,We Were the Mulvaneys,0452282829,Joyce Carol Oates,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"Mr. McCloud's ability to frame the history of both visual and written communication, and the potential for them to be used in tandem to create rewarding aesthetic and synesthetic experiences not found in any other art form, is nothing short of a brilliant accomplishment. This dissertation is disguised as a 'comic book', but don't be fooled! I wish this title had been required reading when I was in 'art skool'. IMHO, it would be especially insightful reading for those currently practicing, or aspiring to a career in art history and/or art criticism. From a creative's perspective, this work will bring hope and validation to those thousands of artists marginalized by the elitist ( and the general public's) thinking that 'comix' are the lowest form of art. With clarity, depth, and brevity this book should be on the shelf of anyone interested in the arts, as long as their ego is in check! :)"
1146,Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art,006097625X,Scott McCloud,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Tiger_Holland,"In this sequel to Beautiful Creatures, Lena the Caster girl wasn't claimed by Darkness on her 16th birthday, like everybody expected, so she and her mortal boyfriend Ethan Wate should have a normal, happy life. But Lena feels guilty over the death of her uncle/surrogate father Macon Ravenwood, and while she hasn't been claimed by the Dark, she doesn't fully belong to the Light, either, which could spell trouble for everybody around her, especially vulnerable non-magical Ethan. 

As a second installment, Beautiful Darkness is a tour de force--it takes all the same elements as the first novel, turns a few on their heads, and ratchets everything else up a notch or two on the dramatic scale. You still get that lush Southern Gothic feel from BC, but now there's a whole lot more Caster magic and mystery swirling around. The plot twists proceed naturally from the setup of the previous story, but every new discovery manages to feel surprising. 

Yet for all that, I didn't really enjoy reading it. I like Ethan, the POV character, and wholeheartedly sympathize with him, but I've finally figured out why he's never seemed fully real to me: it's not that his narrative voice sounds feminine, but to me he sounds like a very young guy. Ethan's incredibly mature and loyal and brave, etc, but even with his ever-growing love for Lena, I almost feel like I'm reading about Percy Jackson, age twelve. There's just a general broad sweetness to him that seems to belong to a younger person. 

Then there's Lena, who I liked in book one, but who has now become a complaining heroine. Lena had her fair share of troubles in BC, but now she's riding a full-time down, and Ethan's so tied to her, that means he's down and depressed, too. She has ample reasons to be sad/angry, reasons that become more evident as BD progresses, but I still wish she wouldn't wallow in her black moods. Now that her Dark side is coming out more, she'll cause a little trouble or exact just the teeniest bit of revenge, and she won't really be sorry about it (I don't necessarily think she needs to be sorry for some of the stuff), but she'll cry anyway. Then Ethan tries to comfort or encourage her, and she tells him that he doesn't understand and he'll never understand, because he's mortal. 

This was a case of the heroine turning me off of the story, because by the time the truly tremendous Big Reveals are happening in the last fifth of the book, I was already emotionally uninvested: I figured, Ethan's wonderful and he'll be okay no matter what, and Lena will be sad no matter what, so I didn't feel the impact of the game-changing scenes like I wanted to. 

Poetry Bonus: I absolutely love the eerie simplicity of the Seventeen Moons song. Love it. And Lena writes poetry, and greats like T.S. Eliot, Walt Whitman, and Robert Frost are mentioned. 

Though this sequel gets exciting and epic, it still maintains the basic feeling established in Beautiful Creatures--if you enjoyed that, you'll enjoy this. Fans of the series will want to pick it up as soon as they can, because it delivers everything we've hoped for and more. People who are on the fence, however, can probably wait to get it from the library."

The Caster Chronicles stays a special place in my heart because it is so much more different than most series out there and it really stands alone in it's genre. Once you pick up the book it is so hard to function in life because you REALLY want to keep reading. Putting it down is like putting part of your brain away because while you are not reading you think about how much you would rather be reading it. The story continues to weave around Lena and Ethan. It strays them apart and dreams them back and we find all sorts of loose ends are tied back together. We loose some characters, gain one and a few come back. It was so wonderful.

Kami really captures the essence of the deep south and the social woes of teenage life. The storyline is definately new and refreshing; not the same ol' same ol' that's being pumped out by every other author out there. A must read!

For those of you comparing this series to Twilight: it's not even the same premise. You should keep an open mind and remember that Bella and Edward are not real. Yes, Twilight is a great series, but so is this one. Be objective and mature if you're going to leave a review. Being grammatically correct helps also."

Before reading this book, I had no idea that there is actually a test (checklist) that psychiatrists and mental health professionals use to determine whether or not someone is a psychopath, and the results influence decision-making as to whether (some) prisoners in mental health facilities and prisons are released back into society. Also, I think like most people, when the term psychopath was used in conversation, I thought ""Silence of the Lambs"", not realizing that the term does not refer exclusively to the crimially insane and murdering lot.  Like most people, I probably have encountered more than one psychopath in my travels and have come away from the experience feeling like I must be the crazy one. What a relief to find out that there is an explanation for this behavior profile. If, like me, you come away from reading this with more curiosity about the subject, Robert Hare's books are a great place to follow up and learn more about the science of psychopathy, although Ronson has actually picked up on Hare's work (Without Conscience) and brought us the research from 1993 to 2011.  A lot of advances in technology have been made in that time that allow scientists to ""see"" and study the workings of the brain, and Ronson shows us little flashes of this, all the while keeping us entertained,amused, and questioning."

This is one book that left me feeling so deeply, it's almost hard to put into words. Its the first time I've read a book by Ms. Picoult. I read it for my book club, and it's not one I would have normaly selected to read on my own... and I would have missed out. So many things stand out to me about this book. The presentation of the story from several of the character's perspective is nothing short of literary genius. It affords you the reader a fuller, broader, more well rounded story because it's all in the first person. The second thing that stands out for me was the amount of research that went into this story. Kudos to Ms. Picoult for a job exceptionally done. It added to the vibrant fabric of this well crafted story in such a natural way that it only enhanced the experience of reading it. And of course there was the story itself. I could talk about the story, the characters, the revelations. But honestly all I can think of is love. The love of a father for his daughter. The bond that such a love can create. It's about when your life is put on trial and under the microscope, what realizations, enlightenments do you come away with. If you haven't read a Ms. Picoult book start here.

       There are many people who write well, there are gifted storytellers; when the two are found in the same person the resulting prose is poetic in its ability to speak to the reader on the deepest levels of one&rsquo;s soul while using the simplest of language.  Mitch Albom proves himself to possess these dual abilities in this small, but powerful, parable of time, life, living, love and the power to celebrate eternity in the space between breaths.
	The idea of time is a relatively recent concept.  When humanity began keeping track of the passing of days, probably in order to have some measure of control of one&rsquo;s environment, we also began a desire to &ldquo;hoard&rdquo; time and began considering the passing of time to be of more importance than the timeless moment.  Mr. Albom does a superb job of bringing this hugely pondered idea (volumes have been written on various aspects of time) into a thought-provoking, easily comprehended, enjoyable allegory and takes only 220 (small) pages to accomplish the task.  
	Before there was time, people enjoyed life as it came.  Planting, hunting, talking, arguing, laughing, watching were occurrences unnoticed as there was no cause to measure their existence.  Someone (in this book, a man named Dor), did notice a &ldquo;moment&rdquo; and became aware that there would another &ldquo;moment&rdquo; the next day.  He began to measure moments/hours/days/weeks/seasons to the point of distraction from all other endeavors.  Dor&rsquo;s knowledge caused him to want more of what was never needed to be known (time) first begging God for more time with his beloved Alli, then cursing God when that wish was not granted.  As a result of his actions he was sealed in a cave for the next 6000 years, listening to the ever increasing voices of the world who were asking for time to be changed (more, slowed,  rewound) until he learns the &ldquo;lesson&rdquo; of time.  His task will be accomplished when he has taught two people, one wanting more time, one desiring less, the lessons he learned.
	These few pages are packed with wisdom of The Moment.  Mr. Albom acknowledges God&rsquo;s influence in his life, but this work is not preachy, religious nor does it seek to convert those to read it to anything beyond becoming aware of the riches to be found in the absence of marking time.  To become aware, to quote Kipling, &ldquo;of the everlasting moment&rdquo; holds all one desires, hopes for and can &ldquo;possess&rdquo; is the aim of this read.
	I make my living &ldquo;measuring time&rdquo; (appointments are scheduled, limited in length, regular in their being proffered) and own more instruments to keep track of its passing than I care to count.  I have never been able to save/spend/take out/waste/keep time except by measuring the anxiety I experience as I attempt any of those.  My &ldquo;addiction&rdquo; to time is deep and, I fear, terminal.  What I am learning, and this book is a welcome lesson in this particular tutorial, is that there are places where time becomes irrelevant &ndash; holding my wife&rsquo;s hand, playing with children, eating good food, laughing with friends, feeling the sun/rain &ndash; and those are the places where I truly am living."

It follows the story of the low-budget Oakland A's and their unorthodox general manager Billy Beane as they use statistics and the scientific method to succeed against teams with much larger payrolls. Lewis is a very entertaining writer, at times laugh out loud funny, who has turned what could have been a very dry subject into a real page turner. I read this in one day, which is unusual for me with non-fiction. Highly recommended, especially in the dead of winter when the beginning of baseball season seems so far away."

I read it after watching the movie, and found a much more nuanced chronicle in the book. Well worth the read, especially if you enjoyed the movie."
1153,"A Dirty Job (Grim Reaper, #1)",0060590270,Christopher Moore,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"The book Moneyball is about a professional baseball player, Billy Beane, who was a good player in high school and college.  Out of college, he was drafted by Oakland Athletics. Beane decided he wanted to become the General Manager of the A¿s after he had played for them for a few years. As a player, he learned that he did not want to be an actual baseball player; he wanted to be the person who picked the players that would make the team. When he became the General Manager for the Oakland Athletics, he developed a strategy to form a baseball team out of players that other teams did not necessarily want. Beane used players¿ high school and college statistics to choose the good players that he wanted and ones that would sign for less money.Though there were many parts that I liked and disliked, one of the big things that I liked about this book was that it taught me a new way to look at how baseball players are chosen for a team.  It showed me what coaches look for in a strong player and that it¿s not necessarily all talent; it is how many runs they produce, bases they steal. Even though this book is really good, the language is not appropriate for young readers, it contains inappropriate words. The hardest part about this book was understanding all the numbers and formulas he used. Since there were so many numbers, it distracted me from what the book was actually about, how he built the Oakland A¿s. That was the only dislike I really had reading this book.  Other than the numbers, the book was really interesting.I believe the main message in this book is that you don¿t have to be the richest team to get the better players for your team. Even though the Oakland A¿s pay roll was really low compared to the Yankees huge pay roll, the A¿s knew the best way to make a good team without spending a lot of money on players. Beane used player statistics to find who the best players were and ones that would sign for less money. I would suggest this book to a specific group, people who like baseball and math.  This book is all about numbers, probability, playing and managing baseball. It was a great book."

The footnotes are some of the funniest lines in this book, so don't forget to read those (at least once in a while).  The story takes you on a journey with a young boy who is apprenticed to a magician in London.  As this child becomes a young man, the reader learns about different magical creatures, conjuring spells, and other basic rules of ""magician-hood"" that set the stage for this story.

The writing and language are mature, but certainly straight-forward enough to understand for a mature 11-15 year old.  There are definitely surprises in the action and up until the last page, I was unsure of the young boy's fate.  It is story-telling like this, that makes this book worth reading and that will impel me to pick-up the 2nd book in the series."

I'm not sure what he is but the book is hilarious. The entire book is pure genious. I laughed and cried and oddly enough lost fifteen pounds because i didnt eat or drink anything until I finished the book. A must read for anyone who enjoys political humour.
1155,"The Amulet of Samarkand (Bartimaeus, #1)",078681859X,Jonathan Stroud,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Lincoln37,"For the last, I am gonna say 400 years; every good American man has lived by 2 bibles; the constitution and the Bible Bible. Now every good American man has a third bible to live by I Am America and So Can You. This book of literature is without a doubt the single most significant piece of writing done since whenever the constitution was written.
	
This book is simply the best piece of modern satire that has ever been published. It is written with very much the same structure as The Colbert Report; which is to say a satire. In the book Colbert acts as a conservative in every negative aspect of a conservative. I realize this is a hard concept to understand but he provides his own perfect explanation right at the beginning of the book. ""I am no fan of books. And chances are, if you're reading this, you and I share a healthy skepticism about the printed word"" (Colbert VII)
This sort of ironic anti intelligence satire is the corner stone of this entire book and it holds together very well.
	
My complaints of this are extremely limited and in fact limited to only one complaint. To me the humor that Colbert is best at is political humor and that was certainly not the focus of this book. Instead of such a sweeping satire of every aspect of pop culture I would have preferred him to stay centered around politics. Instead he covered The Family, Old people, Animals, Religion, Sports, Sex, Homosexuality, Higher Education, The Media, Class war, Race, Immigration, And at last science. If I was his editor I would have cut higher education and animals out entirely and used the extra room to expand science and add a separate political section.

While my review has been obviously quite positive it is clear not everyone will immediately think they will enjoy this book, well I am sorry to say it but everyone is wrong. Regardless of any political feelings you may have the sections old people, science, and 'the family' are nothing short of comedic gold. In attempt to prove the periodic table of elements is evil he takes all the element names and forms a message with them. ""Satan here: Congratulations! You broke the code. Here are instructions. Scientists: Assault faith, drain values. Gays: keep up sex. Yours, Satan."" (Colbert 203). That simple joke should be enough to convince any reader with a sense of humor that this book is for them.

If you enjoyed this Book I would also suggest America by John Stewart. I am proud to say this fantastic piece of literature has earned my first ever 11 flags out of 10."

First of all, it's an easy read, and it gets its points across by telling a story. Other books, such as The Sixty-Second Motivator, have also used this format succesfully, but this style may not appeal to everyone. To me, it makes the book a lot less boring to read. Secondly, the book is short. The vast majority of readers will easily be able to read this book in a day. It has bigger font, which I personally liked and thought it made it a joy to read. However here again, some may be turned off by that and consider it to be too ""child-like."" Thirdly, the book takes solid mangagerial info and gives it to the reader handily in the form of three ""secrets."" I found the advice to be very practical and while some may consider it far too simple, it can help you a lot IF you actually apply the info- which I suspect most managers do not. In conclusion, I recommend this short business classic to anyone looking for better ways to improve their managerial skills. I doubt most will be disappointed."

The book provides a simple approach for how those 'above' deal with those 'below' and dishes this at you like it really is all it takes to be a manager (note: strict adherence to this book may have been all you needed to thrive among the inner circles at Enron). The book revolves around some mystical Super Manager whose draw is that he doesn't need to spend time with anybody; he is finished with you, his subordinate, in, well... One Minute. It is mesermizing to think that you, too, could actually dispose of all your responsibilities with such lightning speed. The greens seem just One Minute away... So how does he do it...?    Classical conditioning, a technique used to train animals for millenia. Yes, One Minute tells you almost nothing you didn't already learn in middle school about how to get your dog to roll over: provide rewards (praise) when he does what you want, and communicate concern when he doesn't.     Now here's the problem with One Minute: effectively managing a project, department, etc in a legitimate organization requires knowledge, competence, and professionalism in your field. Therein lies the other 99% of managing that One Minute dwelleth not upon, the other 479+  minutes of real work that you (and those competing against you) are being paid for.      Anyway, not everything about the book was bad. The content of One Minute is directly applicable to training pets and domesticated animals (thus the second star). I also feel that by reading One Minute I gained a fuller understanding of how such a surplus of mismanagement and organizational failures across the land came to be- the proliferation and acceptance of incompetent one minute managers."

The book tells the story of  the birth of modern Israel against the background of  Arab resistance to this .It  tells the story of  the 1948  Israeli War of  Independance.But it also does this against the background of  the Holocaust, and of Jewish suffering in history in general.  It is possible to say as most critics do that the work is not great literature, but it is not necessarily the great books that change the world. It is ' Uncle Tom's Cabin' and not ' Moby Dick ' which plays a decisive role in changing American history.So Exodus is one of those works which inspired thousands of  Jews in the former Soviet Union to re- awaken to their Jewish identity.  The book is a story of Jewish heroism, and one which gives the sense of  the whole historical enterprise of  the Jewish people as a noble and great one.For writing this book Uris deserves to be remembered warmly in the heart of  those who love and care for Israel.This hopefully is a good share of  mankind, including those who can enjoy this work  as a moving, dramatic story .A great read."

Not only a wonderful novel, but a history lesson as well.  Until I read this book I could not comprehend how young German boys ended up turning on their families and neighbors.  But the book gave me a sense of the way the Nazis pulled young men in gradually, luring them with an ideology that seemed to promise a brighter future.  By the time the Jews were being singled out, these boys were already hopelessy loyal and commited to the 'cause'.  A lover of historical novels, I found this book entertaining and thought provoking.

Hegi illustrates the struggles and victories of a dwarf living in Germany during the 1930s and '40s.

Her characterizations of the people in her book are touching.  She eases the reader through the hard times the characters experience-- she's the ultimate compassionate ""messenger"" of history.

Hegi's story will bring tears to the eyes of the most stern and may even bring about permanent change in the way people treat others, which would be a huge contribution to society.  In fact, this book should be required reading for every high-schooler because one can't help but be moved (for the better) by the poignancy of the story."
1158,Exodus,0553258478,Leon Uris,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Beverly_D,"Trudi is a Zwerg, a dwarf. This makes her something of an outsider, and what makes matters worse, her mother is crazy. As in, going to church and taking off all her clothes for the angels, crazy. Then she dies before Trudi is even four years old. Trudi learns to collect stories, and takes pride in retelling them, reshaping them, making them her own. She also has a touch of prescience.

The Jewish people in Burgdorf are an integral part of the town, initially. But slowly, over the course of years, they are first subtly demonized. There are the German people, and there are the Jews, Us and Them. After the feeling of separation is created, after people have come to tolerate the Jews being insulted, cheated, stones thrown at their windows, they may have their fine houses and businesses taken away. If a Jewish person is thriving while the rest of Germany is in recession, it's easy enough to play on the resentment of the neighbors. Surely those things couldn't have been honestly earned. Once moved to the outskirts of town, they are then moved to other towns, and finally the &quot;work camps.&quot; Hegi does a powerful job of portraying how such a horror can come about. At first, rather than protesting their mistreatment, many of the Jewish people themselves believe that if they just keep a low profile, this too shall pass. By the time the harassment gets serious, it is also taken for granted. Those who protest and speak up to defend their neighbors, are also jailed and harassed.

I found this part of the story fascinating. I found Trudi herself sometimes admirable, generally interesting, and other times not very likable. In the beginning, when she believes that if she hangs from her arms, it will stretch her out and she will grow, I felt very sorry for her, and was moved by her experience of meeting another Zwerg, a beautiful and talented woman named Pia who was comfortable in her own skin. Then there's the search for a boyfriend or lover, because like any girl, she wants to be kissed, and loved. Trudi is definitely a complex, but not comfortable character. She uses rumors - collecting them, spreading them - to get back at those who've hurt her, or who've persecuted their Jewish neighbors.

I think about 90% of the book is told from Trudi's point of view, including the first third. The early chapters move slowly, but as Trudi's voice becomes older, it becomes much more compelling. The end, on the other hand, is a little choppy, as if the author realized how long the book was already, and felt the need to wind it up quickly. All in all, this is an excellent book, rich in description, and well worth the read."

I've never practiced legerdemain, but I do know misdirection when I see it.  If you take away the picturesque phrases and the gritty narration, you are left with an adequate, maybe even a good, but not a brilliant story."

Some of his sentences are blatantly bad in terms of grammar, but who really cares?  I noticed someone mentioned the different ways of looking at the world.

Do we judge Greek plays for their atavistic features?  No.  Don't worry about stuff like that and I promise you you'll actually live longer!  As for The Big Sleep, the one thing that has always sort of bothered me about Raymond Chandler books is that the mysteries don't quite add up.  In The Big Sleep, there are actually murders that go unaccounted for.  It makes it seem as though it was easy to shoot someone back in old L.A.  Tht just wasn't true.  Nevertheless, this is an entertaining read, like all of Chandler's books.  Highly recommended."
1160,"The Big Sleep (Philip Marlowe, #1)",0394758285,Raymond Chandler,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"At first when I started Cannery Row, I figured it was going to be a boring story I might not finish.  As I read further, it grew better.  Cannery Row tells the story of the local characters living and working around an area of defunct canning factories, set in the 1940's.  It feels like the biography of a small town, with the setting and emotions, as characters.  This stands out from other stories because it feels gritty, but it is not a sad, disgusting gritty  it is more a melancholy, sleepy sort of gritty.  The story has the feeling of a perpetual Sunday morning, being laid back, but without the worries of Monday.   Even though Cannery Row is sleepy and meanders along, the humor is not.  Sometimes, the humor isn¿t obvious  you won¿t know something is going to be funny right off, instead you¿ll unconsciously get the joke later in the story.  Other times, the humor builds up like suspense and you¿ll know what¿s coming long before the characters know anything is wrong.  The first few chapters are short stories  they set up the characters so you¿ll understand everyone¿s motives and personalities during the main plot.  The characters are well developed, forming great mind pictures  from the shrewd general store owner Lee Chong, Doc the kind and quiet marine biologist, to Mack the carefree, almost philosophical leader of the bums at the Palace Flophouse.  The story is also compelling because of the variety of subjects.  I found the parts about Doc¿s job of collecting fish and seashells interesting because I knew nothing about it  detail Steinbeck went into led you to feel as if you were with doc, knee deep in clear seawater learning about the ocean firsthand.  Doc and the girl in the water was attention-grabbing and sad because nothing like it had happened previously in the story.  Also the different types of stories within the main story added curiosity.  Steinbeck takes time exploring each character¿s past actions, which makes this story a great melting pot of emotions and feelings.  If you aren¿t interested in books with ¿meaning¿, and you only enjoy books with action filled plots, you might not want to read this now.  If you only read a few books during your lifetime, make this one of them."

1163,"The Miserable Mill (A Series of Unfortunate Events, #4)",0439272637,"Lemony Snicket, Brett Helquist",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Nathan_Dunbar,"It's really gratifying to come across a book that evokes the senses to such a degree that its flavor is brought to the palate. Such is the case with Eowyn Ivey's debut novel, The Show Child. Infused with aspects of pine boughs, mountain herbs, woolen mittens and inspired by happenstance, it breathes new life into an old Russian children's tale Ivey stumbled upon in her bookstore. 

We come to know of aging Jack and Mabel through their childless sorrows, playful intense love and survivalist fortitude all cruxing on a belief in dreams and a touch of magic. Through imagery spun with such crispness as to leave a skiff of snow on your heart and the bite of cold wilderness air in your lungs, it's nearly impossible not to fall deeply into the story of Faina and her enchanted sudden appearance. And I must say, the skill with which Ivey works your emotions, ebbing and flowing like tides with each of Faina's disappearances, belies the fact this is her first book. I found myself really believing Jack, Mabel, Faina and the cast of supportive neighbors--pragmatic George, boisterous Esther and their helpful wide-eyed son Garrett--existed somewhere, somehow. 

I can only leave you with this: when you bring this book into your world, carve out time to give it your full attention. Then make a space for it on your shelf of favorites, it belongs there."

1163,"The Miserable Mill (A Series of Unfortunate Events, #4)",0439272637,"Lemony Snicket, Brett Helquist",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Icecream18JA,"This is one book worth marking as a to-read for 2012!  Jack and Mabel married a little on the late side and experienced a miscarriage.  The sad couple moved to Alaska and tried to bury their unhappiness over their inability to have children.  One night, when the two are particularly sad and feeling a little frivolous, they build a snow girl, complete with all of the fixings.  The next day, the snow child is gone and footprints are left in her place.  The couple do think that this is a little odd, but they must always focus on their own jobs and the event begins to drift from their minds.  




When the two are going about their business, they begin to see these glimpses of a girl in the woods.  It is interesting for the reader to try to decide whether there may be some magic or if the whole event is just a coincidence, the author leaves this up to the readers' imagination.  The author manages to convince the reader that the girl is wild, free, and slightly lonely.  The young girl, Faina, is certainly a strong main character, but she feels more like a wisp of a character at times-many scenes do not even require her presence, but the reader remembers her nonetheless.  The other characters help pull the novel together and move the plot along, they are fun to get to know.  




The setting was richly described, the author is very good at painting a picture in the readers' mind.  The mystery of Faina will remain in the readers' mind long after finishing this book, the mark of a good author is to leave the reader thinking about his/her book long after finishing it.  The shift between the real and the magical is barely there, but the reader is always aware of the dividing line, but likely will vacillate between either side.  This book is highly recommended to young adult/teen readers."

So first off.. that cover.. is it not just absolutely beautiful?? Okay, okay.. On to the good stuff! Wait For You completely blew me away. I laughed out loud. I cried. My heart broke. Truly. A couple times! I was left nearly breathless and I'm sure quite a few shades of red...a LOT. And above all else...I fell in love.. with this book, with Cam, with Avery, with Brit, with Jacob, with Ollie, with the Hamiltons...hey even little Raphael! These characters felt so real and life like. Like they could have existed out there somewhere. Jennifer Aremntrout is seriously gifted that way, in my opinion, with creating these characters that you can't help but adore.

Speaking of. Cam *sigh*. *Swooooon* There are no words. I mean generally I cannot stand a cocky guy. It's such a turn off. But some how, some way, TWICE now she has gotten me into full on swoon mode over some arrogant jerk ..errr confident gentleman. It's a gift I tell you! Ha! Ok he really wasn't a jerk, I just said that more for effect :) 

I feel like such a nerdy fan girl but she is seriously my absolute favorite author. Period. There isn't a thing she can write that I won't devour without stopping except maybe to eat or sleep..sometimes not even then! This book needs to be added to your must buy list. It's funny, tear jerking, steamy, sexy and will leave you with a smile and maybe gasping for air ;) :)

Okay I'll end my fan-girl rant. Don't judge me! lol

And just a warning.. obviously this is a New Adult (NA) book so due to some of the content it's definitely geared towards a more mature ""audience""."

1164,The Snow Child,0316175676,Eowyn Ivey,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Cupcakegirly,"Uniquely different from anything else J. Lynn's written but it might possibly be her best work yet.  

I was so excited and grateful to have the chance to read this!

This, like most of the author's other books is unputdownable and only took me a matter of hours to read. By the time I was finished, two things happened:

1) I found myself at a loss for words because reading about a character whose experiences partially mirrored my own caught me completely off guard. I'm serious when I say, it's been a struggle to find words adequate enough besides just, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

2) Cameron &quot;Cam&quot; Hamilton gave Aiden St. Delphi a run for his pureblood money! Anyone whose read The Covenant Series knows all the awesome that Aiden is made of so you can imagine how much MORE awesome Cam is. (I want a Cam Barbie for Christmas but if not, Raphael will do too.)

The issues addressed in this book are not light, they're heart-wrenching, gritty and raw BUT they're handled so beautifully and in such a realistic way that it's neither depressing nor offensive. There are plenty of laughs, kisses and heart-racing swoons but above all, there is hope. Hope that what happens in the past, whether by choice or not, does not define who you become unless you allow it to. Will those experiences forever change you? Yes. Will they destroy you? Only if you let them.

Wait For You is uniquely different from anything else J. Lynn's written but it might possibly be her best work yet."

It is as if his sole goal is to sound grand. And he succeeds, in this at least, but often the verbosity detracts from the meaning of what the reader is reading... too many pretty words jammed together so tightly that the screen they're supposed to form form winds up opaque. I'd suggest the Longfellow translation for a more pared approach that still manages to maintain Dante's magnificence, or even Ciardi - the people I've spoken to  seem to have a love/hate opinion about his work, but I find it alluring."

Okay, I loved this more than Obsidian, which up until reading this was one of my favorite books ever. (It still is, but this one tops it) I freaking loved this book!! I want to hug it, and pet it, and snuggle it. I want to read it over and over again and shout from the rooftops that everyone should read this!! So much for not being spazzy!! There is a ton of stuff going on with this book. Daemon is even more swoon-worthy than ever, and him and Katy are hotter than ever!! Katy is fighting being with him, but together they need to find out what is going on and try to stay alive in the process. 

Katy is just as awesome as ever! I seriously think she is one of my favorite fictional characters ever. She is tough, and won't take crap from anyone. She obviously wants Daemon more than she wants to even admit, but out of fear that he isn't really into her and it's just the alien mojo connection working it's magic, she refuses to give in. Not to say there aren't some hot scenes between them. Of course JLA wouldn't let us down with the smexy, but Katy is much stronger than I could ever be in that situation. I totally would have been putty in Daemons hands by now. 

Daemon is even more incredibly yummy, swoony, melt my heart, awesome in this one. Not that I don't totally love his snarky side, but oh my, his sweet side made me a puddle of goo. No worries, he is still the arrogant, full of himself, cocky Daemon too, but he is out to prove to Katy that what he feels for her is real. He totally 100% wants to be with her not because they are connected now, but because as much as he has tried, he couldn't not want to be with her. She is worth it to him. He knows the consequences for getting involved with a human. He lost his brother because of it, but he can't help it. I don't know how she resists him as much as she does. I would have done naughty things to him!! 

This book is full of twists. There is plenty of great Daemon/Katy interaction, and then secrets and things that they discover that are quite shocking! JLA knows how to pull you right in and won't let go until you have turned that very last page! This book was like an addiction. If I had to put it down there was like an insistent tug to get back to reading it as soon as possible. If you haven't read any of the Lux series, what are you waiting for? You are totally missing out!! I loved this book with every fiber of my being!!"
1168,The Tao of Pooh,1405204265,"Benjamin Hoff, Ernest H. Shepard",Barnes and Noble,4.7,BlkosinerBookBlog,"Holy chocolate chip cookies. This book was hot and I could not put it down. Jennifer did not disappoint in this sequel to Obsidian. It is just as action packed loaded with humor, sarcasm, plot twists and our favorite book blogging heroine Katy.
    It is pretty much leave me alone, I'm reading, or Oh is it seriously 3am? kinda book where the world seems to fall away and I get to experience what Katy is feeling and almost feel like I am a part of this world of smoking hot aliens, dept of defense peeps around every corner, and trying to figure out certain boys who shall not be named.
    It is so hard to review this without talking about what happened, but let me try. There are so many conflicts going on, I just want for the characters I love to be happy, but I guess what kind of series would it be then? There is conflict with Dee, not only with Adam and what their relationship should be, but also between Dee and Katy. Katy makes some bad decisions, and I just want to smack some sense into her (and so does Daemon for that matter), but I totally understand her motivations behind each of those decisions. And that makes her still a strong and determined main character that I admire. But anyways, one of her bad decisions eats up pretty much all of her time, and leaves some feelings between her and Dee.
    There is also the DOD peeps, and several other new characters that I had absolutely no idea what to think of. They can seem so harmless and good intentions one second, and then the next I am questioning them and wondering if I am paranoid.
    The drama between Katy and Daemon is so thick you can cut it with a knife. And I love every second of it. Their bickering, his pen pokes, the sexy moments and the whispered endearments and declarations. I ate it up. It kept me turning the pages just looking for another scene between them, and then left at the very end yearning, wishing the next book was in my hands.
    And mother of all cliffhangers, really? December can't come fast enough so I know what happens, if revenge is sought, and what exactly they meant about everything changing with mystery character rescued that shall not be named.
     Jennifer is an amazing author, and I love this series, as well as the Covenant series, and just like I know I will probably love everything she writes."

Shepard",Barnes and Noble,4.7,Andreat78,"I truly feel as if I can't say anything in my review that you haven't heard from everyone who has read Onyx. YES! Onyx is as awesome as Obsidian. YES! Daemon is infuriating, awesome, and gorgeous as ever. YES! Onyx lives up to the enormous hype. 

I feel as if I can't say a lot without giving precious details. If you loved Obsidian, you will be blown away by Onyx. Here's why: Daemon. But it's not what you think. Yes, Daemon is impossibly aggravating, in a ridiculously sexy way. In Onyx, though, a different side of Daemon emerges. I wouldn't say he's softer, exactly, but it is a welcome change to see him not actively trying to push Kat away. Of course, the chemistry between the two is fantastic. Daemon and Kat are continuously drawn to one another, with Kat fighting it as much as possible. But who are we kidding? We all know there isn't a snowball's chance in H-E-L-L that she can resist Daemon for long. But...there's a new guy in town, one who takes a noticeable interest in Kat. Could Daemon have serious competition?


As for the plot, there's not a moment's rest in Onyx. The DOD is a continual threat, especially since Daemon and Katy's connection is stronger than ever. The Arum are circling. And it turns out that there may be more to Lux /human bond than ever imagined. Kat learns that no one can be trusted. No one. But is it already too late? Onyx deals one exciting bombshell after another.


It's no secret that Armentrout is a fantastic writer. I read Obsidian last fall, but her story and the strong impression she made enabled me to slide easily back into the world. I didn't have to jog my memory for details. I didn't have to do a quick re-read, though that would be fun. There's a reason the Lux series is such a big deal. It's that good and worth every bit of the hype."

Adam is so complicated, but I feel like she also made him more realistic and human. And Warner? Oh my word, he has become oh so attractive. Finally, Kenji steals the show...Mafi gives him so many fabulous one-liners...if I wasn't nervously tearing through the pages of this book during the drama, I was litetally laughing my head off at Kenji.

One recommendation I have is to read ""Destroy Me,"" the short novella that centers around Warner BEFORE you pick this up. That way, you'll understand his character that much better."

Dunant captures the   importance of art in the period, the struggles of women at   that time.  She also shows the destruction and   resurrection that religious fervor can cause.   Dunant did   an excellent job capturing my attention throughout this   book with her strong story lines, and her hints of stories   yet to be unveiled later on in the book.  I stayed-up for   hours to read this book, and even brought it to work to   read at lunch because I hungered for more!  She   introduces mesmerizing characters and builds the   background of events so carefully, that you wonder what   culmination will come of it.    Unfortunately, Dunant also makes the mistake that many   writers do, of finishing her work too early, in a rush to   end the story.  The beginning and 'meat' of the novel were   outstanding, but the characters fizzled in the end, and   the story line with them.  The revelation of the mysteries   hinted in the book are disappointing at best, and can best   be described as boring and uninspired.    I will give this book 4 stars because overall it was a very   enjoyable read, but it is almost as if a second author   came in and finished 'Part IV' after just glancing at the   first three parts."

The characters are very well developed.  The story has quite a few unexpected twists and turns.   He does an excellent job of describing the motivations behind actions.   The story was told from multiple different character's viewpoint, which, while somewhat distracting, was also very well done.   If you are looking for a feel good book, this isn't it.   My husband felt it was a book about redemption.   It left me feeling slightly sick to my stomach.  I almost stopped reading it on multiple occasions.   It dealt with dark topics, and drug them through the mud of human motivations.   In my opinion, there were too many violence-laced sexual scenes. I, personally, don't care about gratuitously exploring every main character's sex life.  While it's a part of a healthy life, I don't want to go crawling into my neighbor's bedrooms...and that's what it felt like."

Because, in my not-so-humble opinion, great novels and stories (The Queen of the Damned, Needful Things, even The Bridge of Teribithia for goodness sakes) don't transfer well onto the ""silver screen"".
Since Mystic River (the movie) was such a awesome movie (again, in my opinion), I was genuinely concerned that it would be a bizzaro world version of my ""great movie, not-so-great book"" (*ahem* Fight Club *ahem*).  I worried were for nothing.
This novel is tremndous in so many ways.  The layering of plots and subplots, the suspense and heavy tension, the pacing and the overall believability of the characters, even down to their idioyncracies and frailties.
So, in closing, I would highly recommend it to anyone reading this review.

Denni Lehane's prose is excellent and he always writes great characters that the reader can relate to.  To set the record straight, writers like Lehane, George Pelecanos, Richard Price, and other writers like them, write books that are much more than the crime fiction class they are placed in.  Books by these authors should not be compared to James Patterson.  Mystic River should have been a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, maybe even have won it.  It was really that good."
1176,Mystic River,0060584750,Dennis Lehane,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Encharion,"I know, I was skeptical at first too.  The premise of this book is one that is different to be sure.  Don't let that turn you off; different is good.  I picked up this book with the intent of reading a horror/comedy, man was I surprised. 

The book is about the horrors of humanity. But more than any book I have read in a long time it's about Hope and Love.  How above all things there will always be these two guiding lights through the horror of the unknown and the fear that each and every one of us feels."
1176,Mystic River,0060584750,Dennis Lehane,Barnes and Noble,4.6,MissysReadsAndReviews,"Every now and then, there's a book so prolifically amazing that you ignore the fact that its subject matter is something that you absolutely detest. For me, that book was Warm Bodies. Despite the fact that I love zombie movies, I have an extreme dislike for zombie books (save a few)... until now. Perhaps I was reading the wrong type of zombie books? Or maybe I just gave up too soon when I read a few bad ones in a row? Either way, Isaac Marion's novel has completely changed my mind about the matter and I am now more open to the world of zombies in modern literature.

One of the things that sticks out so profoundly about this novel is the fact that R - the main character, a zombie - actually still holds on to some human attributes and there's more going on than just ""Mmm... braaaiiiinnnnsss"" in his thought process. On top of that, there's still feelings involved... which is something we don't see much of when it comes to the living dead. R wants to be more than what he is. He craves to feel, love and have more than just a normal zombie life. He's a character that will surprise you at how easily you can relate to and empathize with.

It would be against all crimes of this blog not to point out that I did creep out a little with the romantic interest in the novel. It was just something I couldn't wholeheartedly get behind. However, as disturbing as it was for me, it was also very beautiful and seemed to fit naturally into the story as a whole.

The story was amazingly written. R's perspective was completely enthralling and the story as a whole was nothing short of incredible. Once I started reading, I couldn't stop reading... even at the parts that made me cringe! The world building in Warm Bodies wasn't much different from present-day society... only, you know, it has zombies and stuff - which is something I am almost certain does not exist. Yet.

If zombie romances are your thing, then you absolutely MUST pick up a copy of Warm Bodies. Right now. If they're not your thing, then I would recommend picking up a copy of Warm Bodies. Right now. I have a feeling Marion will change your mind and steal your heart with this novel."

1177,"Warm Bodies (Warm Bodies, #1)",0099549344,Isaac Marion,Barnes and Noble,3.5,tlevnh,"My 4th grade son was given the reading assignment of choosing a classic book for his report. While I am very supportive of what he reads and always read what he reads, either with him or on my own, I was quite surprised with some of the content in the book.  

While some of the situations and lessons are great for kids to learn, it was quite bothersome and hurtful to my son to read about how the main character, Tom Canty, is treated by his father. While I certainly do not want to ruin the story, he is starved and beaten for not begging and stealing enough to his father's satisfaction. In continuing with the story, the Prince witnesses women be burned alive at the stake while their daughters grasp for them and one of them actually has her clothing catch fire. 

Some parents may certainly be okay with their child reading content such as this, my son had a hard time accepting that he had to read and then write about this among other incidents that happened throughout the book.  

The language is very difficult to understand as well.  While the book was rated for his age group, I feel it would be more acceptable for older children who are more emotionally able to understand and accept that treatment such as what was endured throughout the book was tolerated in the time it was portrayed to have ""happened"".

The footnotes were extremely helpful and made the book a bit more easier to understand and more realistic in some ways.

Hope this review helps other parents in deciding whether or not this might be the best book for their child."

1178,The Prince and the Pauper,0451528352,"Mark Twain, Everett H. Emerson",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Zenophile,"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress is a fascinating and politically gripping novel of gargantuan proportion. Written by Robert Heinlein during the peak of his creative genius, the novel surrounds and encapsulates its reader by transporting them to a time and place that today many believe is not possible. 

The novel is set during 2076 on a Moon colony where the residents were once convicted criminals on Earth. The regime that is depicted in the novel is reminiscent of a dictatorship and the population is oppressed to the point of insanity. The plot centers on a computer technician and a super-computer that becomes sentient during the opening chapters of the book. The computer, referred to as MIKE, chooses to help the technician and others who have come to believe that a revolution is needed on the Moon in order to restore the basic human rights that were once guaranteed to them. The libertarian-style revolution that the computer and the revolution's leader, an eccentric and highly educated professor named de la Paz, orchestrate forces a response from Earth that ultimately leads to confrontation. The confrontation leads to revolution with the Moon colonists faring quite well thanks mostly to MIKE who controls much of the Moon's electrical and mechanical systems. However, even though the colonists ultimately win recognition from Earth, in the final barrage of the Moon, MIKE is knocked about quite violently and when rebooted no longer has sentience. 

The novel is about liberty, desire, and self-awareness. Libertarianism, a key concept in the book, is evaluated and examined with more voracity than any professional political pundit could do and yet, at the end you are left wondering-did it work? For at the end of the story, Heinlein leaves much open. It appears he wanted to let his reader decide the true fate of the revolutionaries. The novel is more than just a fiction book about libertarian revolution on the Moon, it is provides a true social and political critique on the system of government that exists in the United States. There are many threads of thought and consciousness the run through the book that require the reader not only to just read and possibly understand the story, but to question the story. And, as always to recognize ""TANSTAAFL"" or there ain't no such thing as a free lunch!

This Hugo Award-winning novel is a true testament to Heinlein's writing genius and style and in my opinion is possibly his greatest work. This book should be required reading for any individual who questions the motives of the society in which they reside and anyone interested in libertarianism, government authority, and freedom."

Even if you don't agree with his point of view, RAH at least makes you think and think deep about your own beliefs.Personally, I think this is the best of Heinlein's early and middle works. He was about to go off the deep end (in many ways) with his next book - Stranger in a Strange Land.markf"

Heinlein,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Maggie153,"I first came upon this book as I entered my local Barnes & Noble store and noticed two copies sitting on the front table of New Arrivals.  The first thing that caught my eye was the brilliant and intricately detailed, beautiful cover.  Then the title... The Forty Rules of Love - A Novel of Rumi.  I must tell you that I believe in synchronicities and I had just been reading one of my many books of Rumi's poems through the preceeding week... I love his emotion, his beauty and his words.  His philosophy and spiritual love that transcends through his poetry is exhilerating and captivating.  Then I proceeded to read the intro about Shams within the book and immediately knew that I had to purchase this book.  Within 3 days of crying, emotion, overwhelming feelings of love and surrender, I had read the book in its entireity, finding it very hard to put down.  The author, Elif Shafak has captured the very essence of what Shams and Rumi had between each other and told their story with honor and humbleness.  Such love does exist and at this moment in my life when I have felt that maybe it didn't, she has moved me to tears and rocked the core of my soul with her work and words... renewing my belief in true love and the honor & commitment between two souls that are meant to be together... no matter the odds & barriers.  Thank you Elif!  I loved how she intertwined the present day relationship between Ella Rubenstein & Aziz Zahara with Shams and Rumi's relationship of long ago and yet still felt to this present day through the poetry of Rumi translated by many.  After finishing the novel, I could hardly catch my breath... I cried, I laughed...then I immediately went out and bought a book for a dear friend of mine as she too loves Rumi and I knew this book was something she would treasure forever as I do.  When an author can captivate the reader's senses to a measurement of moving them to complete emotion and ecstasy... she or he is more than just an author... they transcend space and time and bring to us the joy and love that we are all looking for within ourselves and outside of ourselves.

Taking a chance with this one, I was well rewarded.  This book was so sad, but compelling.  I felt it was about the choices people make, how so many people do what they feel is the right thing, but it really isn't.  I also found the atmospheric details of Americans in Europe during the 1920s to be rich and vivid. I found Rosemary to be an especially interesting character, and wondered what happened to her long after the novel ended.  Dick was the saddest character, starting with so much promise and eventually fading away."

I'd read The Great Gatsby, and loved Fitzgerald's prose, but wasn't sure what to anticipate with something else.  But I was pleasantly surprised.  Never failing, Fitzgerald manages to depict and enhance his characters and their interactions with details that most other authors are unable to capture.  The story lays out the lives of wealthy American expatriates, focusing on the deterioration of a marriage between Dick and Nicole Diver.  With Dick, we see a man once regarded for his genuine charm, care, and gregariousness.  Yet entrenched in the superficiality of European life...being a doctor at a sanitarium bombarded with a spectrum of psychiatric patients...married to a woman with frequent nervous breakdowns...and lured on by the whimsical innocence of an American actress, once heartfelt outgoingness turns into bitterness and a tool Dick uses to deride others.  Additionally, Nicole's fluctuation of emotion, inability to fit in because of it, and dissatisfaction with Dick's distancing himself, combine to ruin their marriage.  This was one of the saddest, yet truest love stories I've read--being almost circumstantial that they ceased to love each other, and nothing of their own doing.  I strongly recommend."

1185,Cold Sassy Tree,038531258X,Olive Ann Burns,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Guacamole,"Representing the emotional need to escape reality, especially in the turmoil of the Great Depression, Tennessee Williams describes a family of disconnected members each affected by a different. As Amanda continues to dwell in her earlier glories, her two kids struggle to flee from an unpleasant truth through other desperate means. While Tom interests himself with literature and movies, Laura remains preoccupied with maintaining her glass menagerie. In a sense, all three strive to escape the ""coffin"" that represents their mundane lives. 
	
Williams effectively captures the emotions of that era, addressing the absence of Mr. Wingfield and its impact on the mental state of the family. Two prevalent motivations for abandoning a family-the battle for self-preservation and the shame of failing loved ones-are subtly presented throughout the course of this play, as the financial instability of the Wingfields suggest a need for new beginnings. This accurately reflects the chaos of the 1930s, as love, a supposedly universal weapon, fails to save the day. 
	
Combining artistic mastery with heart-wrenching content, Williams employs a lyrical style that uses symbolism to convey loss and longing. Specifically, Tom's final monologue equates Laura to a ""shattered rainbow,"" describing not only her frailty, but also his undying love for his helpless sister. With a distinctly melancholic tone, Williams conveys a sense of unresolved conflict and profound nostalgia. 
	
More prominent than the overall emotional impact is the ironic way in which Williams unites the family under the desire to escape. Bereft of both materialistic belongings and faith in the future, the Wingfields are held together by their common need for change. Ultimately, Tom succeeds in his endeavor, and it is suggested that, despite his remembrance of his sister, he is able to embark on a journey of self-discovery. 
	
Williams eloquently expresses the pains of failed romance, but fails to present any real hope for the future. In a sense, Laura's fiasco with her love interest bleeds through to negatively impact all those around her. No shift or memorable conclusion is presented, and I feel as though the overall moral could have better been developed differently. While Tom does manage to break free from his familial obligations, he does so to follow in the footsteps of his father, not purely out of a desire for self-fulfillment. Through the development of distinct personalities, Williams emphasizes that, in spite of our differences, human beings all seek the same seemingly elusive happiness."
1185,Cold Sassy Tree,038531258X,Olive Ann Burns,Barnes and Noble,3.8,TGU,"Although the Glass Menagerie served as the first breakthrough hit of Tennessee Williams' eventually booming play writing career, I can honestly attest to the fact that I believe that this play was mediocre at best. Granted, this play was all but shoved down my throat and I rarely enjoy books that are delivered in that way. However, this play, in spite of the fact that I actually chose to read it, mildly disappointed me, especially since I was rather thoroughly surprised by the fact that I had enjoyed A Streetcar Named Desire. This just proves to show that an author can have pretty severe discrepancies within his own works. Or maybe I'm just weird.
The Glass Menagerie was too repetitive for my taste, with no actual true plot. With Tom's constant chatter about dreaming and Amanda's prattling endlessly about gentleman callers, it was enough to convey to me the gist of the entire play within the first few pages. The characters were, I found, ill-developed. I could never reason out a comprehensible and logical reason to explain Laura's actions. But then, maybe the illogicalness of her actions is supposed to convey a point also. Either way, I'm not a fan of the way she was portrayed, the manner in which the play panned out. Granted, this is not a play to watch/ read if you're in a sad mood, as the ending leaves much to be desired, serotonin-level wise.
Similarly stagnant was the plot development. It seemed as if the plot were a wheel, centered around a single spoke and unable to branch out into anything else that made sense. I felt the play too heavily focused on the concept of gentleman callers to the point where I was not quite aware of the fact that Amanda was supposed to portray a Southern belle incarnate. With so much emphasis on the gentleman caller, I expected a longer interaction with one when Jim finally waltzed onto the stage. However, like much else in the play, it remained disproportionate and rather awkwardly fitted in. The lack of other characters in the play, with only three main ones also hinder any potential character development the three leads could have potentially had.
However, the symbolism present within the play was most artfully carried out. The whole shpeal with the unicorn and the horn tie in absolutely wonderfully with the idea of normalcy and fantasy, which actually correlates nicely with the overall play and the themes presented within it. I also thoroughly enjoy Williams' style and the dialogue between Amanda and Tom are, in my opinion very believable, in that they mirror the conversations that go on between my own brother and mother at times. At times, also, I found the play surprisingly just purely entertaining. These things kept the general air of pointlessness in the play to a basic minimum. 
Overall, this tale of escapism and failing to do so proves not to be a terrible read, though not nearly as entertaining as other works by the same author. Poignant symbolism and realistic dialogue save this play from fading away with ill development in plot and character."

I understand now why the author gave a synopsis of all the characters at the beginning of the book because there are so many, it can get confusing.  But, as usual, Ms. Ferrante weaves a tale that is endearing, rich, and compelling.  This is a women's book - I don't think a man could relate - and Elena Ferrante describes her experiences, observations and revelations with style and insight.  She makes you feel as drawn to Lila as she and everyone else seems to be. She make you feel Lenu's insecurities.  I wished the ending gave a little more detail about Lenu's future; but the fate of Lila tied in beautifully with the beginning of the book. I love Ferrante's unique writing style and am sad there are no other books left of hers to read (I read them all!)."

I had seen or heard the raves by other authors, editors, magazines, etc.     What all the reviews fail to mention is that many of the ideas and practices in this book are borderline unethical and downright selfish. Examples of questionable behavior Timothy encourages include lying to your boss, looking for loopholes so you can win, farming work to cheap overseas labor, and many more.     I believe in working smarter, not harder, but I also believe in being honest and not bending the rules just to suit my needs or just to prove I can get away with it.    It's also a book written for single people who have nobody else to consider except themselves. If you're married and/or have kids, you'll find yourself struggling through the 'travel the world' parts of the book. Not that it's impossible, just very improbable, to do with a family. What I DID like was the idea of automating as much as you possibly can.This book encourages and even gives you many step by step instructions on how to do that. That's why I didn't give it the lowest rating available."
1187,My Brilliant Friend (The Neapolitan Novels #1),1609450787,"Elena Ferrante, Ann Goldstein",Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,"When my husband brought home a copy of Timothy Ferriss' The 4 Hour Work Week, I was intrigued by the title and eagerly delved into it, in a quest to discover the secrets to accomplishing such a feat. Heck, I'd be happy with a 34 hour work week.       For me, the book was a page turner, as Ferriss revealed the various aspects of his plan for Definition, Elimination, Automation and Liberation 'DEAL.'       What I liked about the book:       * Ferriss challenges the idea that people have to work 30-40 years before they can retire and enjoy life. The idea is to do and accomplish what you want now.     * Ferriss offers a new vision of how to live life and advocates taking mini-retirements throughout your life, while you are still physically able to enjoy them.     * The book provides ideas and instruction on how to finance this type of lifestyle, using what he refers to as 'a muse' business which 'through simplification and automation' requires very little management from you.     * The book recommends eliminating things which cause stress and waste time. An example of time wasters are events such as meetings, constantly checking e-mail, and casual work conversations that are not relevant to your work - all of which result in a disruption of productive work. For time wasting items, Ferriss recommends outsourcing and/or delegating non-essential tasks. He also recommends firing stress causing clients whose accounts produce very little revenue and also encourages the elimination of excessive clutter from work and home.     * Ferriss advocates implementing these strategies to enable us to do more of what matters most.       What I did not like about the book:       * As a 40 something reader, Ferriss' writing and choice of words struck me at times as the writing and of someone who lacked life experience.     * Some of the methods Ferris utilizes and recommends for implementing the strategies outlined in the book, seemed somewhat dishonest and are things I personally would not be comfortable doing.       Overall, I admire Ferriss' willingness to challenge the same old ideas and beliefs about how life should be lived. The book is refreshing in that it offers a new perspective and options on how to live life differently.       Lilia Fallgatter, Author"

It's the kind of book you hope for in a summer read but can never quite seem to find: witty and fun without leaving you feeling like you've eaten cotton candy or insulting your intelligence.  Towles' New York City is so textured -- from the gritty Lower East Side of the 30s to the smooth-like-velvet Upper East and West -- I found myself wanting to go back in time and drink a martini with his heroine, Katy Kontent and the wacky cast of characters she finds herself among. What a pleasure to have found a smart summer read!"

Why You're Reading It:

- You want to read the book that I am calling my favorite of the year, so far!
- New York City, 1930's? You're hooked!
- A smart, witty, & complex variety of characters are enough to convince you to read a book.
- Beautiful prose, continuously moving plots, rich details, and convincing story lines make a book a keeper in your eyes.

What I Thought: 

Hello, and welcome to New York City in the 1930's. Not only will you find the glamour, the music, the lingo, and the romance of one of the golden ages of the city, you will also meet one of the most refreshing protagonists in literature - Katey Kontent. Let's follow Miss Kontent through a flashback to the year of 1938 - a year that defined her life - and meet the exquisite cast of characters that Amor Towles creates on the pages of his debut novel, The Rules of Civility. Against the backdrop of a time when anyone could become anything and women were starting to make their own paths to the top, Towles creates a peephole back through time that has you turning page after page wishing you could actually be there, even just for a moment, to catch a glimpse of the sleek and confident Anne, the charming Tinker, the lively Eve, sweet and sincere Wallace, or intelligent, witty, down-to-earth Katey. (This is the second book of the year with a character named Wallace. Though I'm still waiting for a female Wallace to emerge in literature - this book's Wallace was a tribute to the name!)

My very favorite read this year, landing a spot on my favorite books ever, I was absorbed by this delicious novel. Balancing the thin line between eating it up in one bite but knowing how much I would regret doing that once it was finished - I paced myself so that I could enjoy the company of this book for as long as possible. Towles did an extraordinary job of creating the scene, making realistic characters, and spinning a plot that a reader can care about. The lessons in these pages are timeless even if the era in which they are portrayed is exact (and thoroughly enjoyable). I highly, highly recommend this book to everyone. There are very few books that I re-read, but this will be one of them. The charming dialogue, the poignant passages, the intelligent references, and the three-dimensional characters make this poetic, philosophical book, about life and the individual experiences that shape it, fun to read and easy to digest.

Over and over, I exclaimed to myself (out loud of course, because it doesn't count if people don't think you're crazy), ""I love this book. I LOVE this book!"" I also can not get over how much I adore the character of Katey; and how fast they will probably turn this into a movie (and probably should), but how very, very sad I'll be because this is a book that belongs to the imagination - it's that magical."
1189,The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari: A Fable About Fulfilling Your Dreams  Reaching Your Destiny,0062515675,Robin S. Sharma,Barnes and Noble,4.2,-Madison-,"In Rules of Civility the setting is Manhattan in the late 1930's. I enjoyed the history of what New York City was like during that era through the eyes of a young woman surviving on her own in the city. The description of the culture of the carefree young in an exciting city was exciting to me. Kate, the main protagonist, is a smart, sassy independent girl who takes charge of her own life and if she isn't happy about something she fixes the problem. Frankly, I was surprised at the freedom women had from the perception I've always had before women's lib. I enjoyed the penetrating storyline so much, of its setting and the bigger ideas that are presented in the mix of people and social organizations, introspection, question of civility in all things. It was a much more social time when technology seems to limit the necessity. Madison Pridgen, A member of Between the Lines book club"
1190,Rules of Civility,0670022691,Amor Towles,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"This book has been greatly misplaced.  It needs to be included in the classics section of every bookstore.  It tells the story of the human species impeeding doom due to our over population.  It also explores theories behind human thought.  Is Teela Brown incredibly lucky, or is it Louis's delusionary vision of her?  The rumor of her luck has spread and turned into reality by people's altered perceptions.  This alienates her from society, placing her as some sort of a god.  Although not as tradgic as the other titles I listed, Ringworld is an exploration into human thought as well as exploration into the great unknown."
1190,Rules of Civility,0670022691,Amor Towles,Barnes and Noble,3.9,donkeytiara on LibraryThing,"this is the first truly ""science fiction"" book that I've ever read. (well, technically, I listened to it via Audible.com)  I'm in my late 40's, a woman, and have never watched an episode of star trek in my life.  LibraryThing's ""Will you like this book?"" was strongly confident that I wouldn't like this book.  But i did.  Yes, there were lots of ""tekkie"" details in it (I, for one, don't understand anything about light years, hyperdrives and airlocks)  But the characters were all very likeable, and although the story wasn't uber-exciting, it was easy to picture what was being explained in my head.  There are some writers that take pages to describe the inside of a room....this, happily, was not one of those authors.  Niven is certainly misogynistic in his treatment of women as only sex objects in this book, but still, it's worth the read.  Besides, I love the names Louie Woo....and HellelloPrillolar....can't wait to get goldfish to use these names!"
1190,Rules of Civility,0670022691,Amor Towles,Barnes and Noble,3.9,sturlington on LibraryThing,"This is a book more about a concept than a story: a manufactured planet, flat, that forms a gigantic ring around its sun ¿ what would that be like? It¿s an interesting concept, one that proved intriguing enough to keep me reading, even though the characterization and story weren¿t as robust as I would have liked."
1191,"Ringworld (Ringworld, #1)",0575077026,Larry Niven,Barnes and Noble,4.6,IceyBooks,"When I flipped over the last page of Between Shades of Gray, all I could say was ""WOW"". 

   Everything about Ruta Sepetys's YA debut was heartwrenching and, at the same time, beautiful. There were times when I would smile, but tears would threaten to spill at the same moment.

   Throughout the story, I kept thinking back to Anne Frank: Diary of a Young Girl. But Between Shades of Gray stands out. The story of Anne Frank and all the hundreds of thousands of Jews prosecuted during the Nazi regime is well-known throughout history. 
The people from the small countries of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and other countries suffered almost the same way. Sure, they weren't gassed and thrown in concentration camps for the whole world to know. But that's what made it so horrible. The whole world didn't know. 

   I don't usually re-read books, but so many things happened in Between Shades of Gray that I want to relive to remind myself that the cold winters we face in our warm houses are nothing, compared to what Lina and her people faced. To remind myself that when there isn't enough salt in my lunch, I shouldn't complain. 

   I recommend Between Shades of Gray to anyone who has read Anne Frank's diary and felt something for her. And if you haven't read her diary, you should still pick this book up.

   The efforts Ruta Sepetys put in for researching and compiling such a powerful historical fiction debut have not gone in vain. Pick up a copy of Between Shades of Gray when it debuts in March and relive the events of Stalin's Reign of Terror through a whole new perspective - the eyes of fifteen year old Lina Vilkas.   

To me, the cover suggests the heart-wrenching sorrow to follow. It's beautiful, sad, and suggests hope at the same time!"
1191,"Ringworld (Ringworld, #1)",0575077026,Larry Niven,Barnes and Noble,4.6,retromom,"When I started to read the outstanding reviews for this book I knew I had to read it. This was a part of history I had never heard of. Stalin had anyone who he thought was anti-communist deported and hauled off to Siberia where they endured some horrible conditions. Some of those deported were lawyers, teachers, bankers..just every day people living their lives. The story is told by Lina, a 15 year old Lithuanian girl. The year is 1941 when the NKVD or Secret Police stormed into Lina's childhood home and rounded up Lina Vilkas, her brother Jonas, and her mother Elena. Her father was feared to have been arrested and taken to prison. They were led away in cattle cars and taken to a prison camp. Conditions there were extremely harsh. Eventually they are taken to basically a piece of land north of the Arctic Circle where conditions were unfit for animals let alone humans. The group of captives had to band together and become family to survive. Lina, being an artist kept track of their captivity by drawing pictures. I could feel Lina's hope throughout the story and found myself amazed at her will to survive. I'm not sure I could be as strong or as brave as she. The book is beautifully written. The subject matter can be uncomfortable at times but I think it is an important part of history that must be told. At one point the family is almost separated and Lina's brother is bought back by giving up a family pocket watch. When I read that I couldn't stop the tears. To think this went on and the world had no clue it was happening was just shocking to me. Why hadn't I been taught about this in school? I would like to thank Ruta Sepetys for opening our eyes and our hearts to this story. The story is both heartbreaking and heartwarming. If you read only one book this year, let it be this book. It is an emotional but an important read. This is a book that will stick with me forever."

I had this book on my to-read list for a while, but once I heard it won a large award, I had to see what the fuss was about.

The Round House takes place in 1988 on an Native American reservation in North Dakota.  The reservation is shaken when Joe&rsquo;s mother is brutally raped.  Joe and his father, a reservation judge, work to figure out who committed the crime in order to prosecute.  This is a good distraction for them, since Mom has completely checked out and spends all her time in her room with the blinds closed.

However, solving this crime is not as easy as it seems, because the story is a little more complicated.

Joe&rsquo;s only thirteen, but while he and his best friends work through their teenage trials and tribulations, they also work to find answers that they will be able to live with.

The Round House was an amazing read.  The story was moving, honest, and emotional.  You were able to peek into Native American traditions, as well as some of their struggles with the U.S. government.  This is definitely a book I recommend!

Thank you to Goodreads First Reads and Harper Collins for the copy of this book!

Thanks for reading,

Her writing is amazing - the first sentence will grab you.  But some of the references to American Indian history, law and folklore may sail over your head.  Also, as before, there are characters re -appearing from earlier novels.  Also, if you don't read the New Yorker, you won't necessarily realize that some of the embedded ""stories"" were in fact short stories previously published.  All of that being said - READ IT.  She is an amazing writer.  She narrates stories that all Americans should know about.  And then go back and start with ""Love Medicine,"" her first and go forward.  You will relish every minute!"

These are very interesting to bright kids: imagination-stretching.

Yes, it is very good. Despite the length of this tome, it is a quick read. Do not, however, expect a light read. This book gets into the darkest places, emotionally. The main character is horribly abused and bares the scars (literally and figuratively) to prove it. It I had a complaint, it would that the author seems to go to great lengths to introduce gay characters into the book.Don't get me wrong. I am liberal on the subject. It just seems perfunctory and, at times, out of context. Another thing that I would say is that you have to really pay attention as you read. If you are a skimmer, you may get confused as the author does jump between characters and even times with little or no warning. Finally, if you are looking for a feel-good read, look elsewhere. This is heavy, emotional stuff."

Over time this has been the only series I have followed to completion.  While the idea of all the men dying does not sound particularly original, the storyline is much deeper than one would expect.  Unlike many graphic novels these days, it does not rely heavily on violence and absurdity to advance through the story.  It also focuses not on the plague itself but on how society and the individual deal with the sudden and immense loss.  As the author put it (I am paraphrasing), ""It is the story of the last boy becoming the last man.""  I have to agree.  I will end by reiterating my main point.  This is a graphic novel that doesn't replace substance with style."

Marz??n Jr.",Barnes and Noble,4.5,harstan,"In the last few decades a steel based technology boom has come to Scadrial.  The new Steel Age has led to railroads traversing the surface, electric lights on streets and skyscrapers.  At the same time, the ancient magical system of Allomancy, Feruchemy, and Hemalurgy remains potent though more so in the perilous Roughs than in the urban centers.

For twenty years Waxillium Ladrian has enforced the law in the Rough using his Twinborn skill of deploying Allomancy to Pull metal and employing Feruchemy to change his weight.  However, his time in the Rough is over as he must return home to the modern city of Elendel to replace his recently deceased uncle as Lord Ladrian.  However, he learns upon coming home that a ruthless gang of thieves the Vanishers are abducting women and stealing cargo from the railcars.  His sense of justice and honor has Wax, along with his friend depraved Wayne and genius Marasi, on a mission to rescue the kidnapped and to end the Vanishers reign of robberies.

The Alloy of Law is a stand alone urban fantasy that occurs in the lands of the Mistborn Trilogy, but in the future three centuries after the heroes of the previous tales are alive only as legends.  The brilliant story line can be read without the perusing the trilogy though those who do so will miss out on a fabulous magical fantasy series.  The key to this strong action adventure is the emerging competition between magic and technology except when a rare practitioner combines them.  Wax and his two compatriots add amusing banter to a brisk High Noon in Mistborn guns and sorcery thriller.

Though it is another fun installment, I feel like there wasn't enough plot and character development to really warrant this book (or the price).  This book occurs around two weeks after the end of the last.  Too much felt like a re-hash of previous books; Eric's preoccupied, Jannalynn is vicious, Tara's pregnant, Claude is an ass.  Editing was sub-par, things were repeated several times using practically the same words.  Dead and Gone had a lot going on, and now the last two books were sort of slow.  I understand that Ms. Harris can't have really crazy stuff happening each time, like vampire summits and fairy abductions, and maybe this is just a ""set-up"" book for the next installment and we'll get a jump forward next time.  I certainly hope so, because character development has come to a screeching halt between Dead in the Family and Dead Reckoning."

I've waited anxiously for each new book and developed a sort of trust in Charlaine Harris; I knew there was going to be a thrilling and fun adventure between the covers. I wish I could say this book was a continuation of long term happy relationship between reader and author, but I can't. I don't know what happened here--but this book was just okay. True there are some brilliant spots, moments of terrific imagination. The twist regarding Eric's maker and the maker's meddling certainly makes the outcome of a happily ever for Sookie and Eric anything but a certainty--It's a big time OMG! revelation. There are always questions as to what will happen next at the end of a Sookie book, however, this is the first time I'm both vexed and frustrated by the ending. The story was story arc was so weak, I felt like my order for a rich descendant dessert had been snatched away leaving me with a hard granola bar, it was a huge let down. I missed the Bon Temp rhythm of everyday life that always hums under the clashes. For me those little background stories tug my mind's eye and make Sookie's world real. Perhaps this was a rush book or a bridge book as in one that begins to lay the foundation for the big finale. Who knows? But at a cost of 14.99 for 274 pages in an e-book I expected more. I'm not ready to throw in the towel, I'll be back for the last installments, disappointed I may be, but I still want to know how the story ends.

Just because a book is popular, doesn't mean the company should be milking it with these expensive prices that only result in resentful customers."
1201,"Dead Reckoning (Sookie Stackhouse, #11)",0000000000,Charlaine Harris,Barnes and Noble,3.7,MacPoster,"I read this about 20 years ago and recall it as a powerful, insightful book. Just over a year ago I lost a son, and so this year I decided to plunge back in, expecting comfort, connection via fiction, a new way of coming to understanding. Instead I found myself saying over and over again to myself, ""Sorry Ms. Tyler, you missed that too."" The plot seems forced, the love affair between the mourning father and his new girlfriend cliche, and the ending too easy and predictable. More than that, sorry, but as an act of imagination, it simply doesn't get close to the confusion and pain of this kind of grief, at least for me. As ever with Tyler's writing, though, it is well-crafted. But the humaneness and wisdom I once thought this book contained turns out, now that I've experienced something like what she tries to convey, as shallow and failed empathy. The characters and emotions became to me, in the end, contrivances, not real, and given the subject matter she was attempting too confront, not true enough by  half."
1201,"Dead Reckoning (Sookie Stackhouse, #11)",0000000000,Charlaine Harris,Barnes and Noble,3.7,adamgn,"I had high hopes for this book, but it did not meet them.

As I read, I kept thinking it would get better; that something would earn my interest -- it never did.  

To me it felt like Tyler couldn't decide whether to write her characters as caricatures or purely boring beings.  So in the end, it felt like an awful mixture of people who made no sense whatsoever.  The worst was that the characters would suddenly have wonderful insights into life (i.e., when Macon felt Muriel's cesarian scar), which made no sense since no one in the book seemed to be functioning on any rationally thinking level at any other moment in the book.

Ultimately, the characters were so poorly written that I couldn't even gain interest in the story, which had a lot of potential in my opinion.

It felt like a poor-man's version of Annie Proulx's The Shipping News, which is remarkably better on all fronts.  Perhaps I shouldn't compare because they are slightly different, but that was all I could think about the entire time I read this book."

Anne Tyler's characters are well-developed and quirky, and the plot is very moving. This book definitely made me stop and thing about my own life and how I'm choosing to live it."
1202,The Accidental Tourist,0345452003,"Anne Tyler, Jennifer Bassett",Barnes and Noble,4.9,blue-pearl101,"Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe is a great novel. This book follows two teen boys and the journey through their friendship. Benjamin did a great job of displaying the theme of this book. Throughout the book you see the power of friendship. I really enjoyed this book because the author really captures the friendship between the two boys. Benjamin also knows how to capture your emotions in this book. He makes you fall in love with the characters within a short amount of time.
     This book is about two teen boys. The boys are very different in many ways. Aristotle has a hard time with words and struggles with self-doubt. Dante is very self-assured. The boys may not seem to be a good match, but once they meet they become instant friends. Throughout the book the boys form a special bond, discover themselves, and go on small adventures. Together they learn more about the world and face some big obstacles. But the power of friendship gets them through it. Through each other the boys learn some of the most important parts of life.
     This book was very captivating and was beautifully written. Once I started it I couldn’t put it down. Benjamin really knew how to grab a reader’s attention with the plot of this story. It went at a great pace and had characters that were easy to relate to. The style in which the author wrote this book was great. Hands down I would recommend this book to anyone who loves an emotional story full of twists and turns.
     In conclusion, I would definitely recommend this book. It was a very great story. It really captured the power of friendship and the struggles of falling in love with your best friend. I think Benjamin did a great job with this book. Anyone who loves a great story should read this book."

Even more, the dialogue made the whole piece flow, because it was not plagued with &quot;he said.&quot; More importantly,  I felt very comfortable reading this book because there were no glaring explicit events, yet in no way was it an easy or young read. For those who enjoy quality writing and have been bored with dystopian futures, please read. :)"

There are parallel stories here, told by story-tellers  with different voices (or is it one story-teller?). Uncertainty here is well worth the mental effort to work things out. If you're confused at first, press on! This is a quick read, and ultimately, a satisfying one. 

I would recommend any of Murakami's books. I understand there is another to be released quite soon. I can hardly wait!"

I feel like i need another read throgh to fully appreciate and untangle-if such a thing is even possible-the two overlapping stoies.

1205,Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,0000000000,"Haruki Murakami, Alfred Birnbaum",Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"Despite reading the Alchemist first, this has been the book that made a Cohelo fan of me. I've read it 3 times. Mostly because it illustrates the complexity of a love conflict between two people with opposite personalities, different coping mechanism, dealing with same experience... Considering myself a realist at heart I identify with Pilar the female protagonist, and her struggle to re-discover her repressed feelings and intuition. Every time I've read it, it has renewed my own believe and trust in love, spirituality, and connectedness."
1205,Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,0000000000,"Haruki Murakami, Alfred Birnbaum",Barnes and Noble,4,Jordongdong,Good book with many good gems to learn from.  It is a book based mostly upon a religious spiritual journey so be ready to learn more about God and your relationship with God. Great beginning but I just started getting lost in the story and what was occuring during the end of the book... so which sort of left me unsatisfied.
1205,Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,0000000000,"Haruki Murakami, Alfred Birnbaum",Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"I love Coelho's style and generally find his work inspiring, enlightening and deeply touching. Unlike The Alchemist, The Pilgrimage and the Devil and Miss Prym, I found this one reduntant and highly predictable. Will continue reading Coelho, and look foreward to reconnecting w/the spirit of his material and not rushing through to finish the book as I did this time."
1206,By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept,0061122092,"Paulo Coelho, Alan R. Clarke",Barnes and Noble,3.8,HBond,"I won't spend much time reviewing the story itself.  Just about everyone knows that it's a charming but farfetched story, which is strongly inspired by Robinson Crusoe.  I do want to point out, that despite being in the Stirling Unabridged Series, it is most definitely abridged. There are several examples - the story of the roast maggots from the sago palm is missing.  They eat potatoes but forget to harvest them.  They melt berries to make candles but never collect them.  In the fishing sequence toward the middle of the book, Jack makes a remark about his father's small fry, comparing the large fish he is catching to the herring his father caught earlier, but the episode in which his father catches the ""small fry"" is omitted.

I recommend that one purchase not this edition, but one based on the 1877 translation by Kingston (the Puffin Classics unabridged edition is one such)."

1206,By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept,0061122092,"Paulo Coelho, Alan R. Clarke",Barnes and Noble,3.8,Guest,"Stranded on a deserted island, the Robinson family must survive with just their knowledge and endurance.  The Robinson family became stranded on an island and had to survive with six family members-Franz, Jack, Ernest, Fritz, Mom, and Dad.  They built a winter house, a summer house, and they had tons of animals!  Although ten years on the island was difficult, they survived.  This book was great.  It was very exciting and kept me on the edge of my seat.  I recommend it for anyone that likes castaway-type books.  	They were very smart and knew what almost everything in the wild was.  They found an animal that looked like a wild boar, but it wasn¿t!  They found a plant that was at first unfamiliar, then they realized what this exotic plant was.  They knew how to build their houses and structures and how to keep animals, hunt, and take out the good meat!  They even knew what was bad and/or poisonous to eat and touch.  	They were very good with animals.  They caught many animals and tamed them to help them hunt, or to just be a pet.  They caught and tamed a baby monkey, a baby jackal, an eagle, an onager, a baby buffalo, and even an ostrich!  They took care of them and the animals soon learned what the family wanted them to do.  They had a very interesting way of rehabilitating their animals  they used smoke from a cigar and stupefied the animal.  Then it¿s almost as though the animal started its life over.  	 The Robinson family handled the wreck very well.  If another family got stranded on that island, they might have freaked out.  The Robinson family didn¿t, they built their house easily, hunted, and skinned animals without any difficulty.  Some people might have been nervous to skin sharks or whales, but they didn¿t, they were excited to have whale skin and shark skin.  	This book was excellent.  It was about a tenth grade reading level, but it was worth it.  It kept me guessing what would happen next.  It would seem obvious that something would happen next, and then something else would happen!  I recommend it for anyone that loves the castaway type books.  	    E. Gray"
1207,The Swiss Family Robinson  ,1402726023,"Johann David Wyss, Scott McKowen, Arthur Pober",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"Having been a huge Stephen King fan for many years now, I find myself going back to some of the better novels he's written and rereading them - or even listening to them on audio tapes as I drive to and from work.  I recently picked up Four Past Midnight again and found myself enjoying it even more the second time around.  King's work is like a fine wine, tasting better with time.  The first haunting tale is The Langoliers - a spooky time warp piece about plane passengers who have found themselves stuck in an alternate time where these strange creatures exist.  I enjoyed the story, especially the character Mr. Toomey, but found it a tad too long for my taste.  I still cringe when I think about what happened to the little girl.  The second tale -Secret Window, secret Garden, is more my speed.  It's about a writer who is confronted by John Shooter, an angry man who is accusing him of stealing his story.  This story will twist your mind and has a great ending.  A must read!  The third tale past midnight is The Library Policeman - the best of the four stories.  Ever been late getting your books back to the library?  In King's haunted mind, you'll pay greatly for such an innocent mistake.  This story was not only spooky and creepy but had characters you cared about.  I really enjoyed this one.  The fourth story is The Sun Dog - about a strange poleroid camera which takes photos of a mencaing dog.  With each new picture, the dog gets closer and closer in the pictures.  Another eerie (dog's) tail from the master of horror.  All in all, this was a great collection of four creepy stories you'll love sinking your fangs in to."

I'm eventually going to buy it for The Langoliers, but a real sample just would've been nice. I'm not going to mark down the rating over it, but beware."

There are images of one heart wrenching segment burned into my mind that I will not soon forget. As a psychology major I had long forgotten reading about this research, then I read it dispassionately at a safe clinical distance. Now, Fowler's book deals with the same subject yet grabbed hold of my emotions and would not let go. So much food for thought here family dysfunction, insecurity, love, ethics, pros/cons of animal research of course, but other questions as well, for example, how can we as adults sort out trauma we experienced as a child? Think about it! Admittedly, some of the philosophical discussion was beyond me, but this book has so much more to offer. Give it a try!"

But it is a clever twist on the dysfunctional family theme and also a thesis giving more wind to the  halting of animal testing especially on primates.  It is like an Uncle Tom's Cabin for Primates. There were some preachy parts, yes, but acceptable since Rosemary had to work through all this herself and she did strive to be very transparent.  I loved the references to real live case studies on chimps and the synopsis of their research conclusions.  But I also loved the quirkiness of the story. I have to think on this one for a few more days before I move on to a new book."
1212,We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves,0399162097,Karen Joy Fowler,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"An amazing piece of work from Card, and a great end to the Ender quartet. It is ignorant to think that the ending 'leaves you hanging' because Card could have just as easily put in an ending that makes all the readers happy. But, if you don't understand the ending to the book, then Card's whole meaning is lost to you. Just as well, I'm confused at how someone who finds parts of the book 'so boring' that they had to skip entire chapters completely, has any say in how good or bad a book is if they technically never even read the whole book. The final book in the Ender series touches on as many aspects of human nature as 'Xenocide' did, and truly forces you to make the connection between the Ender's universe and our present, and think of what Card is trying to convey to the reader. Excellent writing, and a pleasant and satisfying end to the Ender series that should not be missed out on."

It took me a while to get into it, It is not a bad read, if you can force yourself to read past the boring parts. Though definitely not the best in Enderverse, I would highly recommend reading this if you have read the previous novels to the series. The entire novel is NOT horrible, so do not be dissuaded by the negativity in this review."

I thought that it was great...not only did we grow to love Ender MORE, but we also got to learn more about the Hive Queen and the pequininos, which I was frankly happy about.  I thought that the character struggles and triumphs were so intense at times, that I felt moved.  Jane, who I didn't care a lot for in previous books, became someone I actually cared about. Even Peter became likable. All in all, I say definitely read this book, maybe you will like it even better than Ender's Game."
1213,"Children of the Mind (Ender's Saga, #4)",0765304740,Orson Scott Card,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"What people don't understand when reading Joyce's Ulysses- is that it is not so much the plot of the book that is important but way the book is written; people claim that it's boring. It is complicated but that is what makes the book the third most researched piece of literature...right behind Shakespeare's work and the bible. That alone says a lot about the work. The complicatedness was intentional. Joyce is a genius and this proves it. How many authors can claim they've parodied the greatest figures in literature--Homer, Shakespeare, Dante, and the bible? Does anyone realize that each chapter is written from a different character's point of view, each chapter is written in a different style, each chapter's is written to follow Homer's Oddyssey?Ulysses is not made for people who want to sit back and just read and not think. It is not made to entertain people. It is written for people who APPRECIATE LITERATURE."
1213,"Children of the Mind (Ender's Saga, #4)",0765304740,Orson Scott Card,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Speedball,"A first reading of Ulysses can be daunting, if not downright frustrating. Take it in bite-sized chunks and keep an excellent description (such as The New Bloomsday Book by Blamires) by your side and you'll be on your way. A previous reading of The Odyssey, though useful, is by no means required, as Joyce draws on myriad sources in addition to Homer.

Subsequent readings will come much more easily and reveal a mastery of the language that cannot be compared to any other book or author. Once you get the hang of it, you'll realize it isn't nearly as opaque (or pretentious) as it's made out to be. It's actually laugh out loud funny in many places.

Even better, find an audio version of the book or read it aloud (especially the Penelope chapter -- the last in the book). It's a book to be heard as well as read.

Also, there are DVDs of a walking tour of Joyce's Dublin that I found enormously useful in adding context to the book -- the city is itself a character."

505,"Left Behind (Left Behind, #1)",0842342702,"Tim LaHaye, Jerry B. Jenkins",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Strides,"Absolutely surprised me with how good it was! I balked at reading it at first and put it off for a good year or so before I finally picked it up and I was blown away. It is haunting, creepy, funny, spot-on scripture, romantic, and thrilling. The authors have expertly wrapped fiction around scripture, without losing any of the credibility and viability of Biblical doctrine, rather enforcing it. For those with a spiritual interest in the Rapture and Endtimes prophesies, this book is a must!"
505,"Left Behind (Left Behind, #1)",0842342702,"Tim LaHaye, Jerry B. Jenkins",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"When I got this book as a present, I had my real doubts. I'm not a person that even likes church, and if I had my choice I wouldn't go, so you could easily see my preconceived ideas of this book, but when I read it and I just couldn't put it down. I was so wrapped up in the plot and the storylines, that at parts I felt like I was one of the characters in the book. Left behind was one of the best books I've read, and now I'm on 'Apollyon.' I can't wait to read, 'Asassans', the conclusion to the end of the earth."

Jenkins",Barnes and Noble,4.4,chillySM,"I enjoyed the author's style in which he deals with the eventual truth and turns it into fiction. Ironically, this fiction will eventually be truth. This is a well written series. The characters appear to come to life as if they are very real."

I honestly cannot wait to see how this suspenseful romance novel will end. Cass's books keep you waiting in pure self torture of what will happen next. Will America get caught with Aspen, will America decide (finally), or will it be herself for the win. Who knows. Her books are definately a top pick for any romace lover, and also good for ones who likes some sass. Pick these books up, I dare you."

This series is so amazing... I started this yesterday and read for an hour or two. I finished the book at exactly 8:47 tonight. And let me just say one thing, I LOVE YOU MAXON SCHREAVE. Oh and maybe one more thing.... If you have not already, pick up the Selection and stay up all night reading if you must, read the Elite, and finally READ THE ONE!!!! 
  Read. Ok why are you still reading this review instead of reading this series? I thought I had made myself perfectly clear. 
   You. Are. Still. Here. 
                                READ.
Ok that's it I'm done writing now so that I am no longer distracting for those of you who would rather read my review on the most amazing books ever than actuay READING the most amazing books ever. 

              GO AND READ ALREADY.

508,Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America,0805063897,Barbara Ehrenreich,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Guest,"This book was horrible.  I can't believe that I gave this person money!    The author doesn't bother to really understand what she is writing about.  She is consistently surprised that the poor folks around her aren't impressed with her PhD.... and what's sick is that she doesn't get that a PhD shouldn't impress the working poor.    Why does she feel that she is so much better than everyone else...  why doesn't she bother to find out how the people around her are actually making it work?  How in Gods green can she have problems getting by for ONE month when she has a paid for rental car, $1000 going into the experiment and an income, however meager?  Why does she feel that eating off you lap is a major plight of the working poor that she has to write about it?  Has she never been to a picnic?     The idea was fabulous... it's too bad she ruined it.  Lastly, no real suggestions to solve the problem?  Raise minimum wage?  Doesn't she realize that the cost for product will rise too... and still a worker at Wal-Mart won't be able to afford to shop there?    All I got from this book was that a spoiled child couldn't figure out how to live on less.  Bummer for her.  Fortunately most people on the planet are a little more crafty and intelligent.    Finally, we as Americans only need to look to other countries to understand what poor really is."
508,Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America,0805063897,Barbara Ehrenreich,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Guest,"While the author's experiment is certainly intriguing and even worthwhile, objectivity is quickly clouded by Ehrenreich's opinions on various social issues.  During the brief time she works as a maid, she's pretentious enough to criticize the people who own the homes she is cleaning. She implies that these owners, many of whom she has never met, must be mean, selfish people because they actually own something of monetary value and are paying to have it cleaned.  The possibility that they may have earned money through hard work to buy their possessions never seems to occur to her. Of course, this might have broken her moment of self-righteousness.   Likewise, on page 100, she describes how self-conscious and ostracized she feels about wearing her garish maid's uniform in a supermarket, saying that she's 'getting a tiny glimpse of what it would be like to be black.' In today's society, that is hardly an accurate comparison. If anything, maybe she got a glimpse of how a disfigured or physically handicapped person may feel, but I doubt such people go about their daily routines with the indignant paranoia she displayed.  Granted, there are injustices everywhere in America. However, it still remains the best country in the world for individuals to achieve their goals and attain economic comfort. It is up to the idividual to take the initiative for improvement; no one else can do it for them."
508,Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America,0805063897,Barbara Ehrenreich,Barnes and Noble,3.6,AdditionalReport,"The setting of this book begins in the place at where Ehrenreich lives, Key West, Florida as she decides to start her low-wage life. The plot of this book begins as Ehrenreich is planning her project on how people live in a low- wage life, and the problems that they may come across, like affording a place to live. After leaving her normal life for this project her first task was to find a place to live, since she figured she would probably make around $7 an hour. But once she found a job at Hearthside she found out that her salary was for $2.43 an hour and eventually decided to find another job at Jerry&rsquo;s in order to live. From there she started moving a couple of more times because she could not find to work with such a low-wage and have enough money for the necessities she may have to come across. In her evaluation she explains how housing is really expensive but, wages have not increased. The main character of this book was Ehrenreich the one who was doing the project to experience a low- wage job. There were also many other characters in which she came across when she was working at different places. The theme of this book is poverty because poverty had a great role in Ehrenreich&rsquo;s book throughout the book she demonstrates the difficulty of survival with a low-waged job. She shows that there are so many other people that are actually living their lives with so many limitations and, things they have to sacrifice like health insurance that may eventually leave them in debt if anything ever really happened.

 Strongly
Remember Me # NetGalley 
D. E. White. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

This is the first book I have read by this author, who also uses the name Daisy White. That was confusing and I had to figure it out to review the book. The author needs to use one name and stick with it consistently. There is a lot going on in this book. It all centers around a group of friends who have known each other since childhood. They have a dark secret that they have concealed since their teen age years. The main protagonist, Ava, travels back to Wales to see her ex husband, who is dying of cancer and her son whom she has not seen since he was a baby. That is a mystery right there that bears explaining. A lot of mysterious events start to happen and cryptic notes are left for Ava to figure out. This was a hard book to determine who was responsible for the going ons. I kept switching between who was guilty of each mysterious event and the next chapter I was convinced it was another character. So, it really did keep me guessing. At around 80% of the book, I finally got it right but it didn’t play out until the very end to be sure. The author could have helped out the reader by translating all the Welch phrases used throughout the book. Some she did and some she did not.  This book will keep you invested all the way through and if you like a good mystery, then you will enjoy this book. I read it in one sitting because I couldn’t put it down. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

I was provided this advanced copy read by NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review.  Thank you for this opportunity."
509,Remember Me?,0593053893,Sophie Kinsella,Barnes and Noble,4,toReadistoEscape,"I felt this was an average psychological thriller.  If I wasn't doing a review I am not sure I would have finished the book.

The plot was engaging but could have been more believable. The author didn’t provide much reason for the characters actions.  Therefore, some it was not realistic to me.

  The main character, Ava, could have been a more believable policewoman.  The way the character was developed it was not believable that she was in the police force.  I did not like the writing style of the unknown villain.  I found the parts narrated by the villain “cheesy” and boring. 

I received this galley from NetGalley."
509,Remember Me?,0593053893,Sophie Kinsella,Barnes and Noble,4,Shelley-S-Reviewer,"I have a weak spot for a good psychological thriller and I was drawn to Remember Me as soon as I saw the cover and blurb. My first impression wasn’t wrong: this story without doubt delivered. Remember Me isn’t just another well written suspense story with an intriguing plot and a mystery to unravel though. The development of the characters in general is very realistic and they feel genuine. The writing style is very engaging and makes it really easy to enjoy this story, and the many many plot twists will keep you guessing about what is really going on until the very end. You won’t see the final revelations coming.

With all the dishonesty and the strange, sometimes violent, goings on you can feel the tension slowly building. So much duplicity, so many lies. You will think that you know, but you really won’t. Remember Me is a well written psychological thriller with a healthy dose of mystery and suspense that also manages to incorporate a very important topic realistically while adding an original touch to the story at the same time. There are lots and lots of plot twists as well to keep you busy and all in all it’s a great read. If you like an intriguing and suspenseful read, full of duplicitous characters and mistrust, then you should absolutely give this a go."
510,"The Great Hunt (Wheel of Time, #2)",0812517725,Robert Jordan,Barnes and Noble,4.7,HouseOfReads,"Although I'm sure this book stands alone as a good read, I can only recommend starting from the first, The Eye of the World, and continuing onward. This is a great series; the characters are awesome and you will want to be one of them. The women rock, and are in no way to be confused with drippy, moony, boring, shrieky, ditzy dipsticks with heaving bosoms so common in much of the genre. These gals will kick your sorry bum! Though a fantasy world, the books traffic in the collision of cultures from martial to natural, fundamentalist to liberal and everything in between. It's a really neat way of considering any kind of cultural conflict, in addition to a rip-roaring good story. Pick these books up and dig in to this world!"
510,"The Great Hunt (Wheel of Time, #2)",0812517725,Robert Jordan,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Guest,"Loved this book, but like The Eye of The World, I thought that Jordan gets so verbose in the first couple of chapters, that its hard to get too deeply into his world soon enough to continue on.  The sequence in which Rand is seeking to escape Dal Fara goes on forever and I thought at times that the entire book would be just that.  If he entered one more room and described it down to cracks in the floor, I was going to put the book down forever.  Comparitively, the final battle at Falme, what I thought was some great suspense writing, takes 3 pages at best.  I'm certainly going to continue with the series, but hope that it doesn't bog down again."
510,"The Great Hunt (Wheel of Time, #2)",0812517725,Robert Jordan,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Guest,"Robert Jordan is pure genious!  He is the most amazing author to come into this world.  I have read through his 4th book (The Shadow Rising) and I am never dissapointed with anything that Robert has dished out towards us, the readers.  Among all of his books that I have read so far, I think that The Great Hunt would have to be the most enchanting one yet.  With non-stop action around every corner.  It is truly amazing.  The Great Hunt shows the struggle of a young man chosen to live a life that could mean the end of the whole world if he becomes mad.  He was chosen to be the dragon reborn, followed by some other Ta'veren, who also happen to be close friends of his.  The story  brings new heroes and more amazing events than the first, in this massive story of magical sedai and warriors in this gigantic world of fantasy.  Robert Jordan...Bravo!!!!!!!!"
511,"Postmortem (Kay Scarpetta, #1)",0743477154,Patricia Cornwell,Barnes and Noble,4.1,SusanMA,I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this series.  I started reading in the fall of 2008 and am now re-reading #15 while I wait for #16 to arrive.  I recommend it.  Start with #1.
511,"Postmortem (Kay Scarpetta, #1)",0743477154,Patricia Cornwell,Barnes and Noble,4.1,JessLucy,"This book was so scary that I kept getting up to check the locks on the doors and windows as I was reading it. I love all the novels in the Kay Scarpetta series but this one just sticks with you. The psychological aspect of the plot; the fact that the killer is attacking women not within the same ethnic race; was very fascinating. I could not figure out who the culprit might be and was shocked and disturbed when it was finally revealed. I read this book twelve years ago and the sense of fear still stays with me. If you like this book, you may also enjoy: the novels of Tess Gerittsen, Tami Hoag (A Thin Dark Line, Ashes to Ashes, Dust to Dust), James Patterson's Kiss the Girls, and the true-crime books of Ann Rule."
511,"Postmortem (Kay Scarpetta, #1)",0743477154,Patricia Cornwell,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"I read this book for the first time many years ago, but it is still the best murder mystery I have ever read.  I pull it out at least once a year to read it over and over again.  It is so captivating that I read it straight through everytime."
512,The Complete Stories and Poems,0385074077,Edgar Allan Poe,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,Great book and deffinitly worth the money. Poe was a genius.
512,The Complete Stories and Poems,0385074077,Edgar Allan Poe,Barnes and Noble,4.4,mldavis2 on LibraryThing,"Much of Poe rates a 5-star.  I read the complete works which included many early poems, a genre that Poe professed to love, and some secondary early works that lack the polish and sophistication of his masterpieces, hence the overall 4-star rating.  I find Poe somewhat of a humorist with his occasional use of absurd character names and his tongue-in-cheek sophisticated language in many of his tales, including those usually associated with horror.I don't know if I would expect readers to plow through the entire 5-book set of complete works as I did, but as a truly American writer, poet and analyst, Poe has set some benchmarks that led to later writers such as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories and other forensic efforts.  This set is well worth exploring for Poe's influence on later writers."
512,The Complete Stories and Poems,0385074077,Edgar Allan Poe,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Terpsichoreus on LibraryThing,"Not many people outside of literary study or detective fiction fandom realize that the character of Sherlock Holmes was inspired by Poe's Dupin. Dupin was the brilliant and insightful idle noble who occasionally aided the authorities in particularly difficult cases. However, unlike Holmes, Dupin took it up merely as a hobby, mimicking Holmes' brother Mycroft.I'm not fond of Poe's poetry. Emerson's leveling of 'Jingle Man' is appropriate. Poe puts sounds together, but usually says very little with them. It is unusual that his prose was so varied while his poetry tended to obsessive repetition. Poe presents an example of the turning point when poetry ceased to represent the most complex and dense literary form (as in Milton and Eliot) and became the most frivolous and unrefined (the beat poets), while prose moved contrarily from the light-hearted to the serious.When divorced from his single-minded prosody, Poe's mastery of the language elegantly serves the needs of mood, characterization, and action. This is not always the case: his Ligeia retains his poetic narrowness, but his detective stories have a gentleness and wit found nowhere else in his oeuvre.The three Dupin stories helped to inspire detective fiction, using suspense and convoluted mystery to tantalize and challenge the reader. He may not have been as influential or innovative as Wilkie Collins, but his contribution still stands.Any book of Poe's is worth purchasing simply for these three stories. They are studies in the careful use of language to develop mood, character, and drive--even in a sparse plot. They are not quite the equals of Ambrose Bierce's short fiction, but they are solid enough."
513,The Hiding Place: The Triumphant True Story of Corrie Ten Boom,0553256696,"Corrie ten Boom, John Sherrill, Elizabeth Sherrill",Barnes and Noble,4.6,purtle,This book was very good! like awesomely good! It's about a woman hiding Jews in her house during the holocaust and they get caught. She and her family is taken to prison and later put in a concentration camp. It is a very touching and inspirational story. If you want something to read in a cozy chair one rainy afternoon this is the book.
513,The Hiding Place: The Triumphant True Story of Corrie Ten Boom,0553256696,"Corrie ten Boom, John Sherrill, Elizabeth Sherrill",Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"We have all heard the story of the holocaust. It was a tragic experience for many and to this day, this black mark on human history haunts the lives of numerous souls. While there are an abundant amount of books about the holocaust, The Hiding Place has a quality in which none of the rest have, or so I have found. It is a story of a dedicated Christian girl living in Holland during the reign of Hitler. While she is initially safe because of her religion and background, her family and her quickly learn how serious it is, to even befriend an undesirable (Jew). The consequences may be worse than death itself. 
	Since it is non fiction, The Hiding Place is incredibly accurate and descriptive of the true happenings of Corrie Ten Boom's life. I absolutely loved the book. It was filled with every emotion imaginable. I found myself laughing one moment and crying the next. There is truly not much to dislike. If anything, I found myself wanting a more detailed account of what happened in parts. Corrie Ten Boom has done an amazing job at recounting her tale. Being in first person, she captures you and you seem to become a part of the Ten Boom family; sharing with all their joy and pain. 
	The Hiding Place is a great book for just about any age. Whether just starting high school, or you have children of your own, it is a book that will engage any audience member. The lesson of forgiveness and courage to stand up for your own beliefs is one any person of any age can learn and gain from. To think of how many people suffered though this tragic experience and lived full productive lives is encouraging. I feel I can now face anything life throws at me with just a little faith and determination. 
	If you enjoy this book or books about or involving the Holocaust, you may also enjoy I Stand at the Door and Knock by Corrie Ten Boom,? A Prisoner and Yet... by Corrie Ten Boom,? and The Diary of Anne Frank by Anne Frank.?"
513,The Hiding Place: The Triumphant True Story of Corrie Ten Boom,0553256696,"Corrie ten Boom, John Sherrill, Elizabeth Sherrill",Barnes and Noble,4.6,Goose315,"This book is about Faith and God's love. Despite all of the horror and evil around them, the ten Boom family never gave up hope and continued to help others to cope with the unjust treatment of people during World War II by sharing the word of a loving God. The Hiding Place is a book about a Christian family who risked their own lives to save as many Jewish people as they could from being hunted down by the Nazis during World War II. They knew that hiding the Jews in their home and later moving them through the secret underground network was against the laws of the land however, it was absolutely the right thing to do as Christians. Their faith drove them to care more about the people who were being persecuted than their selves. When the secret room was discovered and the ten Boom's were sent to concentration camps as punishment, the reader questions God's hand. We later learn that their faith was far more useful in the camps. I could not stand to read how awful the Nazis were. I do not understand why the German public didn't rebel and stop the madness. I was riveted by the graphic tales of the concentration camp life for the prisoners. I also could not stand that the Germans would disguise themselves to catch people going against the law. I think that was a little too far. I liked how the ten Boom's continued to risk their own safety and how they came up with clever codes to protect their Jews and themselves. When they built the secret room, it was amazing how small the room was, and how many people they could squeeze into it. You just knew that only God could have protected them for so long. It was moving to see how God worked through Corrie ten Boom as she became a prisoner and yet, she continued to help others in the camp by referring them to God. I also like how the history of World War II comes to life through this book. You should definitely read this book if you want a real personal view of what life was like for a Christian family during the Nazi era. This is a true story and it is written by Miss ten Boom herself. The Hiding Place is an encouraging book about unending Faith and love during unbelievable times. I haven't read any other of the ten Boom books but, I would like to. My overall rating of this book would be a 4.5."
514,The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,0192835084,Arthur Conan Doyle,Barnes and Noble,3.7,AZ_ReaderLR,This book was obviously scanned from a book and then posted here.

515,The Prince of Tides,0553381547,Pat Conroy,Barnes and Noble,4.3,PHMMD,"I've read a lot of books, and this one has always topped my list of favorites.  There's something about the way that Pat Conroy writes that just draws me in (I even enjoyed ""My Losing Season"", and I have absolutely no interest in basketball) -- his descriptions can conjure up a place or a person in a way that makes you not just see what he's describing, but really KNOW it.  I have South Carolina in my blood, and this book makes me feel that in a way that really shocked me the first time I read it.  As other readers have said, this book is FAR better than the movie it inspired; it is an absolutely spellbinding piece of literature and one that you can't possibly forget.  I am thrilled that it's now an eBook -- I plan to read it many more times on my nook!  Pat Conroy is my all-time favorite author, and I truly feel that ""The Prince of Tides"" is his best."
515,The Prince of Tides,0553381547,Pat Conroy,Barnes and Noble,4.3,SC2NY,"I confess that the 5 stars I gave this book are because of the way it takes me back home - to the South Carolina Lowcountry. As a transplant to the NYC Metro Area, the novel's setting couldn't be more perfect for me. Tom Wingo is a bit crude, but his tales of home are enough to make me want to pack up the moving truck and move back to Charleston.

Conroy does a good job of mixing stories of the past and present without treating the reader like a child who needs hand-holding. The transitions can be as abrupt as an errant thought, but also come at predictable moments. There is variety, humor, love and just about every other intense human emotion.

P.S. - As usual, the book is MUCH BETTER than the movie."

516,The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay,0312282990,Michael Chabon,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"If you want to indulge yourself in Escapism at its fullest, definitely read ""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay"". This book is so spell-binding, you will sometimes forget you are reading a work of fiction. The characters come to life on the pages of the book, as well as in the comic books Joe and Sammy write. At times you will sympathize with Joe, then yell at Anapol, be mystified by Rosa, and hope for Tommy. All in all, this is an utterly fascinating book! Be prepared to have a dictionary near you at all times!"
516,The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay,0312282990,Michael Chabon,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Lisa_RR_H,"I suppose given this is my first book by Chabon, I shouldn't yet say I have a new favorite writer, but I can say after this one I want to go out and read all this others. First, the author is wonderful at conjuring up WWII era New York City--especially as a native New Yorker I loved how he took me to that time. The novel also somehow in its characters and events gives me a new understanding of what went into the imagining of comic books from the feats of Houdini to the yearning to punch Hitler in the face. It makes me care and feel for the characters, particularly Joe--you feel his desperation trying to get his family--his Jewish family--out of Nazi Europe. As many takes on the Holocaust as I've seen, I can't recall a work that shows you this aspect of it--not of those trying to get out but those trying to get them in and those attempts lend a great deal of suspense and later poignancy. Then there's the style--I can't say enough about the style. Reading I'm reminded of some virtuoso on the piano or violin miraculously playing some work by Liszt. The work is in done in omniscient voice--rarely seen in the last century and so rarely done well, but here it's a great deal of the pleasure in reading this story--beautifully, sometimes sensuously written, insightful with flashes of humor, a wonderful imagination and the sort of story you're sorry to come to an end. I left it feeling this was a story for the ages--but it was something else I've rarely read in so-called ""literary fiction""--great fun to read."
516,The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay,0312282990,Michael Chabon,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"I have never been an enormous fan of comic books, yet when a friend of mine recommended this novel to me, I took him up on it.  I found it to be an amazing, incredibly human story.  The description was vivid and realistic, easily understood, yet the author used words in ways I had never seen before.  The characters, I found, were as real to me as my friends, and I found the well-placed comic relief a welcome break from the depth of the story-who would have thought, in a book about comics?  As much as I would love to keep this book to myself, I feel it deserves every ounce of praise it receives, and I think that every award it was given could not do it justice."

I visualized everything that was happening and I can rarely do that. Although im mad that in that Perfect Chemistry video on this site, the guy playing alex is ugly as you know what. but anyway, i highly recommend this book. its amazing. it makes me want to move to illinois so i can find me an alejandro fuentes. soooooo, i think twilight obsessers should read this book because once you do, you won't be obsessed with twilight anymore because this beats that...bar none.

But out of all of the books I've read, this is definitely one of my all-time favorites. I love how real the story seems. You can picture almost picture Alex's cocky grin, and see Brittany fall for him. This book may have a typical happily ever after ending, but from the way Simone Elkeles goes about it you realize it's one of a kind. This story is so intense from the gang warfare to the school projects. I've read it twice, and i still can't put it down."
517,"Perfect Chemistry (Perfect Chemistry, #1)",0802798233,Simone Elkeles,Barnes and Noble,4.8,Anonymous,"Prefect Chemistry, by Simone Elkeles, explains the lives of two very different people living in the north and south side of Chicago. The main two protagonists are Alex Fuentes and Brittany Elias. Alex is a Hispanic boy associated with a gang called the Latino Blood. He is very fit and very protective of his family. Brittany Elias is your typical rich American girl. She&rsquo;s the most popular girl in school, captain of the cheerleading squad, and her boyfriend is the star quarterback. Alex and Brittany first meet on the first day of senior year. Brittany almost crashed into Alex&rsquo;s motorcycle in the parking lot which causes a little argument between them. Their first encounter doesn&rsquo;t go well, but they&rsquo;re in for a surprise. They have just found out they will have each other in the same chemistry class, and to top it off they&rsquo;re partners. Alex and his new partner can&rsquo;t seem to work right. They argue over every little thing and can&rsquo;t seem to agree on something simple, such as where to work on their project. As time goes by, they get closer and feel comfortable with each other. They have now realize they both have secrets, secrets that can be dangerous if anyone where to hear about them. Brittany has always portrayed herself to be the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; girl and Alex has always acted as a tough guy, but are these two characters really what they say to be? Brittany&rsquo;s life at home is horrible. Her dad is almost always away on business and unable to help emotionally at home. Her mom is under a lot of pressure because her oldest daughter has a mental disorder and worries that one day her friends will discover she has been lying about her &ldquo;perfect life.&rdquo; Alex has to seem tough so no one messes with his family seeing how his father was killed when he was six, and now has that responsibility. He knows it&rsquo;s hard for his mother to support three kids on minimum wage, so he&rsquo;s decided to make something out of his life. Not caring about the world and their inner conflicts, Brittany and Alex decide to begin a relationship. Once publicly displayed, trouble is not far behind. Brittany&rsquo;s parents highly disagree of such romance, and Alex has now gotten himself into some trouble with the leader of the Latino Blood and he can&rsquo;t seem to get out of. When asked to do a special job, will Alex listen to the promise he made Brittany or do the job to learn information about his father&rsquo;s murder? I would extremely recommend this book not only to girls who love high school romance, but to guys as well. I say this because I myself am I guy and I have to confess I did enjoy reading this book. This was the first book I&rsquo;ve ever read that&rsquo;s been written in alternative-first person point of view and had me flipping pages almost every minute. At some points I would chuckle. This author really captured the protagonist&rsquo;s feelings and made them sound like believable characters. Seeing how I took pleasure in reading Perfect Chemistry, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind reading other books with a similar plot or by Simone Elkeles. When using flashbacks, Elkeles descriptions are very detailed. When reading these parts of the book I felt myself right in the middle of the action. I don&rsquo;t regret reading this book and I trust neither will you. If you have already read this book I suggest you read to following ones: Rules of Attraction and Chain Reaction."
518,Peter Pan,0805072454,"J.M. Barrie, Michael Hague",Barnes and Noble,4,Charlotte_Isabella,"This is not your typical Disney version of Peter Pan. This version is actually very heart wrenching. It tells the story of Peter Pan, Tiger Lily, and the Lost Boys of course, but the Disney version only sugar coats the story where everyone lives happily ever after. This is not the case in this original tale of a boy who never grows up while everyone in the real world does. Heart breaking. Love this version, though. Everyone who is a fan of the movie, or who never wants to grow up should read this. I guarantee you wont after reading."
518,Peter Pan,0805072454,"J.M. Barrie, Michael Hague",Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"In a world full of weak, sappy and utterly meaningless books, sometimes it's nice to sit back with a cup of tea on a rainy day and crack open your grandfather's worn copy of Peter Pan. With its whimsical heroes and frightening villians, this book is more than just a thoughtful, exciting adventure.  It's a look into the Victorian world through a child's eyes.   Get past the mousiness of Wendy, the arrogance of Peter and the carefree exterior of the Lost Boys and you'll find a hauntingly beautiful tale about love and how precious a life is, no matter how short it may be. I highly recommend this book!"
518,Peter Pan,0805072454,"J.M. Barrie, Michael Hague",Barnes and Noble,4,healingmercy,"Peter Pan may be a children's book but I recommend it highly to anyone who feels like they need to get in touch with their imagination. Trust me, there is truth that lies in it for all ages."
519,"Pretties (Uglies, #2)",0689865392,Scott Westerfeld,Barnes and Noble,4.4,kels10,"Filled with fantasy, this book is amazing! Tally used to be an ugly but not anymore. Theres a new Tally now who is totally gorgeous and has the hottest boyfriend around. But when she finds out the truth about being pretty will she want to stay that way? I would recomend this book to pretty much anyone. You should especially read this if you're into fantasy. Once you start reading this you can't put it down. I loved this book, so i read the whole series. It uses lots of figurative language, and the author makes you feel as if you're part of the book. Mental images roll through your head the whole time you're reading it. Be sure to read the whole series: uglies,pretties,specials, and extras!"
519,"Pretties (Uglies, #2)",0689865392,Scott Westerfeld,Barnes and Noble,4.4,WordCandie,"I'm not Westerfeld's target demographic, but he writes complex and engrossing novels that appeal to me nonetheless. I loved watching Tally's character evolve in Pretties as she realized everything she'd hoped for turned out out not to meet her expectations following her experience with the Smokies. This story captures the conflict we all experience in adolescence between what we believe about the world and the realities of it. The exploration of a possible future dystopia is so well described that I feel as if I could purchase my own hoverboard and crash bracelets!"
519,"Pretties (Uglies, #2)",0689865392,Scott Westerfeld,Barnes and Noble,4.4,KaylaNicole_MusicLover,I found that Pretties was not as good as Uglies. I also found that it kind of drug on in parts. I also found I like David quite a bit more than I like Zane. Not that anyone reading really cares about my opinion. But that is what I think. Read it if you want more from the series. I just found it a bit disappointing.
520,The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle,0965341984,"Haruki Murakami, Jay Rubin",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"Haruki Murakami is known for his casual narration, his lack of conventional plot structure, and for the many metaphysical happenings in his books that more often than not go completely unexplained.  The latter of these things may seem off-putting to a first time reader, but I think of this as a strength.  To put it another way, finishing a novel by Haruki Murakami is like awakening from a dream that you know instantly was important and meaningful, but whose meaning still remains unclear.  It is a powerful experience, and The Wind-up Bird Chronicle is among his deepest and most complex works.  The plot is centered around Toru Okada, who wakes up one day to find that not only has his cat gone missing, but his wife has left him, disappearing without a trace or a reason.  As Okada seeks to find her and to reconcile with her, he meets many unusual people who either help or hinder his progress: sisters Creta and Malta Kano, the former of whom describes herself as a 'prostitute of the mind'...a wealthy former fashionista identified only as Nutmeg, and her deaf son Cinnamon...war veteran Lt. Mamiya who survived an encounter in World War II but still feels his life has been taken from him...opinionated teenager May Kasahara who lives in his neighborhood...and his well-known politician brother-in-law, Noboru Wataya.  Hovering aroung this narrative is a mysterious bird, often heard but never seen, that Okada feels is winding the world's springs, ensuring that reality continues another day.  The story culminates in a most likely metaphysical hotel that can only be reached by descending to the bottom of a dried-up well.  There are many side stories and characters that make the book more interesting, giving it more depth and casting different lights on the situations.  And while the ending is open to interpretation of the reader, it is a satisfying and ultimately victorious ending, for in many cases Murakami deals not with achieving success at life, but at achieving success at being able to live.  Subtle and complex, this is perhaps the greatest of Haruki Murakami's works."

520,The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle,0965341984,"Haruki Murakami, Jay Rubin",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"Murakami does an amazing job capturing the amazing ennui of suburban Japan:  the quiet steets, the orderly backyards and the sometimes tedious monotony of Anytown, Japan.  Into the mundane and the boring Murakami drops a load of strangeness and unusual occurences. The contrast betweent the seemingly normal and banal, and the 'far out' of the protagonist's new reality makes the unreal strangely real.  Anyone who has spent time in Japan has probably come away with the uncomfortable feeling that there is more going on than meets the eye of the casual, Western observer; Murakami's odd mix of reality, quasi-science fiction and the supernatural lends support to the idea that multiple levels of existence might just exist in contemporary Japan.  Like all of Murakami's work, The Wind Up Bird Chronicle is finely crafted, sparing in its use of language and addictive.  His are some of the few works that you wish would just go on, and on, and on."
521,"The Lincoln Lawyer (Mickey Haller, #1; Harry Bosch Universe, #16)",0739465511,Michael Connelly,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"I bought this title as a bargain book having no prior experience with this author.  This turns out to be a great read, with suspense, danger, courtroom drama, and a plot full of twists and turns.  The characters are drawn well and the narrative is crisp without being shallow. Very satisfying and right up there with the best from Turow and Diehl."
521,"The Lincoln Lawyer (Mickey Haller, #1; Harry Bosch Universe, #16)",0739465511,Michael Connelly,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"This was so well done, you hated the characters and loved them at the same time! It delved into the gray areas of the legal profession as a whole and of course nothing is ever easy or perfect. I read a lot of (ashamed to admit) legal-type mysteries but this was one of my favorites from a sheer fun perspective."
521,"The Lincoln Lawyer (Mickey Haller, #1; Harry Bosch Universe, #16)",0739465511,Michael Connelly,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,I have read so many books and I can not believe how good this book was I can't stop talking about it to my friends. If it had been a movie I'd been on the edge of my seat. Never a dull moment. I really do hope that he does more of Mickey Haller stories.  I will be reading all his other books as well.  I can't say enough about this. When I first started reading this book I was so excited when I read he was going to Lancaster court because that is where I lived so I was really getting into that and then the story just got so good.
522,Cloud Atlas,0375507256,David Mitchell,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"Cloud Atlas is difficult to describe.  It is hard to explain what the book is about, precisely.  It is a book about what makes a story, and it is a book about what it means to be human.  Ultimately, it is a book that forces the reader to question what is reality.  It is a postmodern tour de force, laden with literary allusions.  For example: Sonmi-451 is a clear reference to Bradbury's classic 'Fahrenheit 451', and her story parallels themes explored in '1984'.  Similarly, Zachry's tale of Sloosha's Crossin' is much like Russell Hoban's 'Riddley Walker'.  From Frobisher's letters, to Luisa's quest for truth... from Smith's journal and his final question at the end, 'Cloud Atlas' is a brilliant novel that intertwines stories and styles across centuries, continents, and cultures.  The stories are relatable and terrifying, and all speak volumes about human nature and its relationship to stories.  It is not a novel that you can say is 'about' something, in terms of plot.  It's far more thematic.  It's about humanity's relationship to one another, to stories, and its quest for truth and the definition of reality.  An excellent read that blew me away."
522,Cloud Atlas,0375507256,David Mitchell,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"Very rarely have I encountered  such  a masterpiece of storytelling.
Each of the six stories is complete , yet is so tightly interwoven into
the others that you simply can't put the book down. I can honestly say
that I would not recommend this book to anyone looking for a quick and
easy story. The allusions, the shifts in dialect, and the gallops across
time periods and cultures require a level attention that the casual
reader might find alarming.  However, if you're a deep thinker and you
want a book that  will make you examine your connection to the past,
present, and future, this is the book for you!"
522,Cloud Atlas,0375507256,David Mitchell,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"Don't be frightened off by reviews citing the book's 'experimental' nature. While not perfect, in 'Cloud Atlas' Mitchell moves seemlessly from voice to voice and finds a way to make six very different narratives almost equally engaging. Yes, there is a momentary sense of frustration when moving from one truncated section to the next (one even ends mid-sentence), but it's easy to get past this once sucked into the next thread. Mitchell drops enough breadcrumbs in the first half of the book to imply a reward for enduring the interuptions, and indeed he delivers on several levels: the literal linking of the narratives (whether they be manuscripts or sci-fi holographs), the philosophical/spiritual implications of reincarnation or distant relation, the unfortunate consistency of human oppression, and the dependence of all fiction (including history) on what has been created before. A tad of environmental preachiness here and there where the narrative itself would have sufficed evinced a few sighs here, but none of consequence. And some of the homages may be mistaken for derivative writing (Melville, Orwell and Huxley foremost), but in fact they form the basis for a more profound relation than that between the six narratives themselves, as 'Cloud Atlas' itself admits to being admits to being another legend drawn from legends. Mitchell has used a technique similar to that of Italo Calvino in 'If on a Winter's Night a Traveler' and pushed it beyond creative novelty. He infuses the novel with a rational, integrated plot structure that, beyond giving the reader a feeling that in the end it all 'makes sense,' itself adds a deeper layer of meaning."
523,The Things They Carried,0767902890,Tim O'Brien,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"The author, Tim O'Brien who is also the protagonist, begins his novel by describing an event that occurred in the middle of his war experience in Vietnam. In ""The Things They Carried"" Tim O'Brien describes what his fellow soldiers in the Alpha Company took with them on their missions both mentally and physically. Many things they brought with them are intangible, while others are physical objects, including matches, morphine, M-16 rifles, and M&M's which he seems to focus on the amounts of each of them.

Throughout the novel, he mentions many characters multiple times in various stories which are often partially true and meta-fiction. The first member of the Alpha Company to die is Ted Lavender,a low-ranking soldier who they refer to as a ""Grunt."" Lavender is a man who has found tranquilizers and marijuana the only way to relieve his anxiety and fix his problems. He is shot in the head on his way back from going to the bathroom, and when his leader, Lieutenant Jimmy Cross, finds out of his death he blames himself for Lavender's unnecessary and tragic death. When Lavender is shot, Cross is deep in his thoughts of his college crush, Martha. O'Brien writes about how Cross's ""love"" for Martha was the cause of Lavender's death and he still holds his guilt years after the war has ended. O'Brien continues on describing the events he was involved in, and then goes into each of them describing how his fellow comrades and sometimes himself reacts, and attempts to overcome them. He uses somewhat real stories to describe how tough it is for a man to be in a situation like what he was in, meta-fiction suggesting that no real story can describe what it was like. These problems that were presented to O'Brien and his fellow soldiers in the Vietnam War changed all of their lives. The war changed them to such a point that every day, every moment of their lives yet to come will never be like before the war. O'Brien tells of others and how they have attempted to overcome their problems which are the same or similar to his. He seems to attempt to use their methods in hopes that they will fix his problems and he will be able to return to his life before he was given no choice but to head to war. O'Brien was led into a room with no way out, he is stuck carrying what he was carrying at the end of his experience in Vietnam and he is striving to find a way to get it off of his shoulders and find a better mental state. This novel could be thought of as a way that Tim O'Brien used to share his thoughts and feelings of the war and his post traumatic stress disorder.

Overall, this is an excellent novel. It is a great ""thinker"" book and is not a typical easy read for a High School student like myself. It is very fun to read, but it is also very difficult to read which would be one, if not my only dislike of this book. This book would be great to read because it gives you an excellent point of view from a veterans perspective; this novel shows a true veteran and what it is like to be one. An overall rating of five stars, a great book that brings satisfaction and difficulty at the same time."

Tim O'Brien kept me wanting to come back for more.  The detail he uses describing the settings and events as they unfold will captivate you.  The litteral and figural things they carry are so well explained by O'Brien.  Deffinetly a must read for any Veteran or history lover."

This book was nothing short of AMAZING, a truly remarkable read. The novel is essentially a series of interconnected short stories about a group of soldiers in Vietnam. My uncle was a Vietnam veteran, and he told me the book was about as good as they got when dealing with the subject matter (perhaps given to the fact O'Brien himself is a Vietnam veteran). I have encountered few books required by school that have made their way into my top-faves list. This one, I must say, is in at least spot three if not two. I cannot wait to read more by O'Brien and I hope he never stops writing!"

The accompanying titles and quotes are equally stimulating - sometimes very funny and sometimes very serious, but always making you think 'why didn't I think of that' or 'I know just what you mean'.  The humour can be nothing but British, there is no other like it. If you want something to stimulate your mind and make you do a double take, you must check out this 'wall art' book.

It is defiantly one of the best books I have ever read in my life.  And this book is not far from it.  I received this book from NCTE from Harper! Thank you so much.  I could not wait to read this book.  For the last couple weeks I have been told that I have to read it.  That it is amazing!  And boy is it ever.

The book starts where the first book finishes. The chapters are split in Now and Then. You are learning about Lena's experiences on finding herself. She is trying to figure out who she is because Lena is not the normal Lena anymore.  She is different because she has to be.  She is in the Wilds and she is trying to survive.  She is learning to do things that she has never done before to pull her weight with the Wilds.  I really like that Lauren incorporated this into the story.  It showed her struggle with what she had to do.  It showed that she was having a hard time dealing with the death of Alex.  

But during this you find out about Julian.  Julian is a very important.  He is about to be cured and he is doing it because this is what his family wants.  But there are some hold ups because Julian and Lena are kidnapped and held hostage.  They are going to do anything to get out and escape to the Wilds.  Oh but have no fear....there are twist and turns!  Boy are there twist and turns!

This is my favorite book of the series so far!  I know that we still have book three so I need to wait unit that book comes out to make my decision, but this is defiantly up there for book of the series!  Maybe book of the year....but ask me again in December...:)"

A serial killer who only kills ""bad people"", what a concept, huh? and it makes for a great story. I saw the first two seasons of the series on showtime and loved it, so I decided to give the books a try. I picked this one up the other day at a local used book store and once i started reading it I couldnt put it down. I figured that since i still knew most of the plot line it wouldnt be as intriguing but it deffinitely was. finished it in about 3 days and thats fast for me because normally I'm doing all kinds of other things and just don't have as much time to read, but I made time for this book. Lindsay just pulls you in and engrosses you into the story. And I never thought i would be rooting for a serial killer not to get caught. I was also highly surprised to see that the 1st season of the show stuck pretty closely to the book. Of course they added some things and changed a couple things but all the basis was there and a lot was the same. This book was thrilling, exciting, funny,....it had it all. so if you are even considering this book. Give it a try..i don't think you will regret it."
526,"Darkly Dreaming Dexter (Dexter, #1)",0307277887,Jeff Lindsay,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"Having been introduced to the show before even knowing there was a literary basis for it, I had high hopes for this book. I was not disappointed. Lindsay does a superb job of engaging us with his now iconic anti-hero, making Dexter a fully realized human being who is charming and repulsive in almost equal measure. Though some reviewers have expressed a preference for the televised version, I think this book makes a solid companion piece that will fit nicely on the shelf of any fan of the series. I'd also urge anyone who enjoys the deliriously twisted world of Dexter to check out Crimson Orgy, a new novel by Austin Williams that blends dark humor and jolting suspense/horror to great effect."
526,"Darkly Dreaming Dexter (Dexter, #1)",0307277887,Jeff Lindsay,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Brian Dutkiewicz,I saw the tv series before reading the book. I could picture the cast acting out the scenes.

I only have one word that comes to mind. Phenomenal. Let me tell you if you're not really a big reader and you're looking for something to spark you interest this is the book to pick up for sure. It sure rekindled my love of reading and many times I found it extremely hard to put the book down. I was so hooked that I went out to buy the whole Sookie Stackhouse series. The genre is Fantasy/Mystery but I found it to be so much more than that. This book has everything you could possibly want in a book. It's got of course fantasy, mystery, adventure, light comody or humor, detective, drama, a bit of gothic, and you can't forget the romance with a splash of the supernatural. I mean really, what more could you ask for in a single book? The story starts off in a little town called Bon Temps in Louisiana where the main character Sookie Stackhouse lives, a beautiful mind reading outcast. Working in a local tavern and shunned by all ""normal"" men she is ecstatic when a tall dark and ever so handsome vampire strolls in to have a drink and forever change her life. Bill Compton. Little did she know exactly what their entanglement would get her? Soon after finding her friend and co-worker murdered she is summoned to Dallas Texas to do some investigating work for the Area 5 sheriff, Eric Northerman, whom she owes so is duty bound to do what he asks of her. Her assignment was to find out what happened to a missing vampire that has been kidnapped through her mind reading abilities. Going around Dallas reading other human's minds sounds easy enough right? Wrong. She finds herself in a whole lot of trouble many times over with many, many close calls of near death, fights, beating and even kidnapping. Through this whole worldwind of trouble and mayhem with her loving vampire by her side she somehow pulls it all off. Sookie and Bill find out what had happened to the missing vampire and some things she wished she didn't know (or rather hear). She then returns home to do some investigating of her own. She closes the murder case of her co-worker/friend. All seems well for the moment and she's turned into quit a survivor. I don't know what else to say about this book, except, you just have to read it. It's got something for everyone. You'll fall head over heels for the characters and the crazy things that happen. I employ you to read this book and tell me otherwise but chances are you'll find it as hard to put down and I did."
528,"The Dragon Reborn (Wheel of Time, #3)",0765305119,Robert Jordan,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"The Dragon Reborn is the third book of the Wheel of Time series by author Robert Jordan. After reading the book I was both very happy with some parts and somewhat disappointed with other parts. But overall The Dragon Reborn was a very good book. I strongly recommend reading the first two books of the series as to not be confused with what is happening in this book. Even having read the first two books readers will be confused and mislead until about the middle of this book because of the way Jordan puts everything together, but the book is more exciting for that reason because you never know what will happen next. As with all of his other books Robert Jordan puts a lot of detail into his book in terms of setting and characters, and this lets the reader delve deeper into the story itself. The Dragon Reborn is a continuation of Rand trying to fulfill prophesies of the Dragon, but he tries to do it alone and leaves his companions to try and track him down so he doesn't get himself killed. As with the previous two books this one is also a cross between The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter but it only has a few chapters that have anything to do with magic, while the rest of the book is fighting monsters and traveling. With the complexity of the book it is geared more towards a young adult to adult audience, and not recommended to a younger audience, first of all for its complexity but it also has some stronger language and scenes that are for the most part inappropriate for children. In all a great read that would make the reader want to continue on with the series until the end. The one bad part about this book is the abrupt ending.
	I would definitely recommend this book to any fantasy fan."

The chapter functions (pages left in the chapter counters) never worked, and since the ebooks add so many ""pages"" to the reading experience it made figuring out whether or not to start a new chapter before going to bed harder for me than the e-versions of other books in this series that I have bought.  I realize that ebooks cost a bit more than paperbacks, but with that I expect all of the functionality of the ebooks I buy to be spot on.  This particular book was a bit glitchy as well (would often get stuck in certain pages and cause headaches for even continuing onto the next page in spots.  Very annoying).  Not the best ebook I have ever bought, but the story is great and I am excited to read the next in the series.  Hope the quality of the ebook is a bit more on par with books 1-2."

529,Gulliver's Travels,0141439491,"Jonathan Swift, Robert DeMaria Jr.",Barnes and Noble,3.4,AnnieBM,"Forget the cartoon versions of the Lilliputians and read the original. This collection of adventures from four voyages (Lilliput is only the first voyage.) builds in satire and its cutting edge right through the fourth voyage. Although written in such a different time, the book remains biting in wit and thought provoking. A most read for those interested in custom and culture, power and authority, and politics and economics in a shrinking world."

529,Gulliver's Travels,0141439491,"Jonathan Swift, Robert DeMaria Jr.",Barnes and Noble,3.4,Guest,"A work of incredible genius. Every section provides new insight into human folly and idiocy- and whether one is a Houhnymn or a Yahoo, Big -Ender or  Little-Ender one must delight at the human capacity to bring  the human down to its proper size. The brilliance of Swift is evident everywhere most poignantly perhaps in those creatures who go on living forever while continuing to physically and mentally age- perhaps modern medicine should have read this section.  A remarkable work but not especially for those who love mankind and wish to be optimistic about human life."

The basic plot of the play is ok (think of any romantic comedy, and you'll most likely think of something with an element similar to this), and it does have its entertaining bits, but really, only Shakespeare's wording and humor save it.  Don't get me wrong--Shakespeare is very humorous, and I was laughing at some of his writing ever since I was a kid--but something about combining the humor with a love story just doesn't entertain me.Maybe I just look for more action and less lovey-dovey stuff in my reading..."
531,Beowulf,0393320979,"Unknown, Seamus Heaney",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"From a town living in fear to a hero saving the day in less than a week, Beowulf was a novel of much action and excitement. This is a wonderful read and something that people will be reading for years to come and it will never lose its popularity because of the writing style and literature to remember. Beowulf is a story in which the town of Heorot is threatened by this horrible creature Grendel who wreaks havoc on innocent people when the sun goes down. Then this hero Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow, hears about the cries for help from Heorot and decides to rake up his men and drive their boat over there to defeat this malevolent villain. When they get to the town and spend a night there they hear Grendel in the castle. Through a battle between two opposing forces Beowulf defeats the hated monster so the town can live in peace. During this part of the book the author, Seamus Heaney, does a wonderful job of giving imagery of the fight so the reader can actually feel apart of what is going on and how Beowulf is feeling throughout all this. Heaney also does a good job of getting into the character's minds to show how they are feeling. Then when everyone thinks his or her hometown will be happy once again the mother of Grendel comes to avenge her son. Beowulf and the angered mother face an even more difficult battle when Beowulf emerges his powers and wins for Heorot once again, but this time beheading the hated Grendel as a trophy for the town to praise. I think this was the most important part of the book because it gave great peace to the town living in torture once and for all and everyone was granted the serenity of feeling safe. When Beowulf returns to his home of Geatland the people hear of his leadership and victory that they make him king when the old king Hygelac passes away. Beowulf made the land full of prosper and safety until he is old and faced with another challenge. A thief has come to his home of Geatland and hordes treasure protected by a frightening dragon. The rest of the book is just as amazing as the first parts and anyone would be wrong to not read this. In my opinion this book was highly entertaining. I also thought that for this being such an old book that it is impeccable to be so popular and liked that people are even wanting to read it in today's day and age of technology taking over."
531,Beowulf,0393320979,"Unknown, Seamus Heaney",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"Ok, as an English Lit. major in school, I've had my share of Beowulf, most of which are horridly translated drivel. The fine line with Anglo-Saxon poetry (and any translated poetry for that matter) is there requires a balance between fidelity to the text, and fidelity to the ideas of the text; that is to say, where literal translation may be more 'accurate' in a completely logical and scientific sense, the poetic beauty and proper notions behind the text must also be upheld.         Heaney finds the middle ground so commonly lost in modern translations. The Anglo-Saxon poetry of Beowulf is so beautiful and easy on the ears when read in the original Anglo-Saxon--a sense of bold and strong verse, but with the grace and beauty--reflected in Beowulf and especially in the Wurm. This is frequently translated into modern english as grossly (what I would call) 'harsh' and 'grating' verse, with all the punch that it requires, but without the languid fluiditiy required to fully appreciate the epic. Seamus Heaney finds the perfect balance between the two, not addressing the 'bone-crunching Beowulf' as a solely heartless character, but finding the section of the modern english language (that lost area right in the middle of form and function) and giving us this gift.        A MUST have for anyone wishing to appreicate the beauty of Germanic poetry. My recomendation: have someone read it aloud to you; it adds SO much to the experience!"
531,Beowulf,0393320979,"Unknown, Seamus Heaney",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Oneira,"In my class on Anglo-Saxon (the language), we basically translated this the whole semester. It wais such a hard class! I was one of two undergraduates, the rest were grad students. My biggest problem with the language is that it was never standardized. So even with a big Anglo-Saxon dictionary there's no telling if you'll find what you're looking for due to all the spelling variations. Anyway, I've read Beowulf (in Modern English) many times, starting in 8th grade advanced english. It is a great epic, originally pagan though there are interpolations from Christian editors. It gives one a really great glimpse at the society it depicts, and if you compare it to the archaeological evidence you a nearly complete picture. Highly reccomended for anyone who likes epic poetry, modern fantasy genre, and of course, pre-literate germanic and scandinavian peoples."

532,Batman: Year One,1401207529,"Frank Miller, David Mazzucchelli, Richmond Lewis, Dennis O'Neil",Barnes and Noble,4.5,eg180,"They should change the title to &quot;Jim Gordon: Year One.&quot;  I'm not going to say I didn't like it, it was a good read.  However, it's not like this is the &quot;definitive&quot; origin story or even the best one.  For starters, it's less than half about Batman.  It's told from the perspective of Bruce/Batman and Jim Gordon, but it seems to center more on Gordon than Batman.  Sure, you see Bruce coming back to Gotham and trying to be a vigilante, but it's patchy.  They go from him trying a simple disguise that doesn't work to deciding to become a bat through the usual means (one comes through his window) and, the next thing you know, he's Batman.  We see some of the stuff he does as Batman, but not a lot of it.  We mostly see him fight thugs and corrupt city officials.  We don't see him doing much investigation or even hunting down criminals.  He just pops up to do things and then goes away.  The rest of the book is a very in-depth telling of Jim Gordon's first year in Gotham.  He comes to Gotham after getting into some unspecified trouble in Chicago and then has to deal with a pregnant wife, corrupt cops and a lot of other stuff, including the Batman problem.  It just seems like the book is more about Gordon than it is Batman.  That's not really a problem, I like Jim Gordon's character.  However, the book shouldn't really be called &quot;Batman: Year One&quot; when it's hardly about Batman.  Most Batman books center solely around the title character, this is one of the few I've read that doesn't.  I just don't get people raving about this book like it's the ultimate origin story for Batman when that part of the plot is overshadowed by Jim Gordon's part of the plot."

534,When You Are Engulfed in Flames,0316143472,David Sedaris,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"Now, while I have heard a number of good things about David Sedaris' books, I have never actually read one before. Despite this, I was pretty excited about reading 'When You Are Engulfed in Flames', and I was not disappointed. Sedaris' newest book is a very funny collection of essays about ordinary everyday events in his life, or at least ordinary for him. All the stories in his book feel almost intertwined, possibly because they all to build up to a realization, almost like lessons he learned over time. Whether it is his realization that country spiders don't survive well in the city, or Sedaris eventually learning what makes one of his neighbors tick, Sedaris is very good at building a story over time. He can look at a number of events at different times and places, and see how he came to a better understanding because of these seemingly unrelated events. He also tends to make the simplest things seem more fun and exciting, such as quitting smoking. Not many people would decide to temporarily move across the world just to quit smoking. I think, in the end, David Sedaris is just skilled at comedy and story-telling in general. After all, isn't comedy just making the mundane amusing?"
534,When You Are Engulfed in Flames,0316143472,David Sedaris,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"Maybe because I've read all of his other books I found this one a little disappointing.

There are few things worse than looking forward to a new book by a favorite author and instead being sold a pile of garbage. It's not funny, it's not insightful. This book reads like Sedaris gathered up all of the stories he'd thrown away over years of writing- the ones too awful for anyone else to see, and then had them published to see if any of us were dumb enough to read them."
535,"Daughter of Smoke & Bone (Daughter of Smoke & Bone, #1)",0316134023,Laini Taylor,Barnes and Noble,4.4,The_BookishType,"This is a rich, imaginative tale of magic and monsters, war and heartbreak. The world-building in this novel is breathtaking, the backstory a tapestry woven with strands of legend and otherworldly secrets. Laini Taylor's style is beautiful and intelligent, bewitching in its elegant flair. The pacing is perfect with never a dull moment, whether the intensity comes from the heat of battle, the awe of discovery or the mystery of Taylor's monsters.

Taylor's imagination knows no bounds. This is the most creative, original story I have ever read. Daughter of Smoke and Bone is a book that cannot be easily defined. It is a long history of war and senseless hate, otherworldly races and ancient magic. It is a fantasy and a tragedy and a romance. It is all these things and more. The descriptions are lush and vivid, the characters terrifying and oddly compelling, the lines between good and evil hopelessly blurred. It is a tale of self-discovery and irrepressible love, a coming-of-age story like no other.

Karou is such a compelling heroine, the kind of girl that shouldn't be crossed. She is quirky and mysterious -- from her naturally blue hair to her bullet-scarred belly -- a complex character who is alive and engaging from page one. Her mental life runs deep as she struggles with a lifelong sense of emptiness, and the constant frustration of vague answers from the only family she's ever known. Karou is smart and skilled, and she knows there's more to the story than she's been told. She is fearless when she needs to be, but vulnerable at heart. It's impossible not to fall in love with this one-of-a-kind heroine.

Her relationship with the chimaera who comprise her family is a complicated one -- full of loyalty and love, but also the betrayal and pain that plagues every family. Yet their deep-rooted bond is one of the most heart-warming aspects of the book, and is crucial to the impossible decisions Karou must make. Though they are repeatedly called ""monsters"" or ""devils"", Taylor takes care to show that nothing is so black and white. Karou's unconventional family fiercely loves her, and even when it's not always clear, they're acting with her best interest at heart.

A major part of what makes this tale so engrossing is the setting. Prague is a beautiful, enchanted place with cobblestone streets and macabre pubs -- anyone who reads this book will want to hop on a plane immediately. Taylor brings the scene alive for readers, making them feel the majesty of the city's beauty and the sting of the wind's sharp bite. Prague is timeless, full of hidden nooks and dusty secrets, the perfect setting for a tale of star-crossed love and forbidden magic.

Taylor perfectly balances drama and action with wit and passion, the kind of read that tickles the imagination and seeps into the soul. Readers will delight in the mystery of the devil's teeth, the brutal war between worlds and the truth of Karou's identity, never knowing where this colorful saga will take them next. Taylor's storytelling is stark and exquisite and lyrical, but also haunting, dark and sometimes tragic. When the many strands come together to reveal a stunning and heartbreaking truth, readers will never know what hit them. This is a fast-paced and high-soaring adventure that spans continents and worlds, generations and families -- but ultimately it all comes down to one girl, one special, strange girl with a secret sadness and a forgotten past.

~Review from the"
535,"Daughter of Smoke & Bone (Daughter of Smoke & Bone, #1)",0316134023,Laini Taylor,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Shanella,"I'm at a lost to describe this book. Is it a fairy tale? A twist to the old Romeo and Juliet story? A tale of war? A tale of prejudice? It's all of these things and more.

Karou is an artist whose imagination creates the wonderful hybrid creatures on the pages of her art-book - which is popular among the other art students at her school in Prague. The creatures are so realistic and Karou even has stories about them, telling it all with the wry smile that hides the fact that her imaginative creations and fantastic stories are real. 

I was transported. 

Laini's descriptive writing style printed such an impressive image of Prague in my head that I'm ready to call a travel agent and book my flight. If only Brimstone's shop could be reached via plane. 

I was enthralled. 

Karou, Zuzana, Issa, Twiga, Yasri, Brimstone and the rest, leaped out of the pages. Laini's characters are so well developed that I can picture them, right now, almost as if they are crowding my room, vying for my attention. The story was constantly moving, shifting, twisting; but never overwhelming or dull. I practically devoured it. 

I was mystified. 

One of the best parts of this story was the reveal in the end. In the back of my mind I knew what was happening, I knew where the story was going - because of the clues that were hidden along the way - but it wasn't until the reveal that everything became clear. I love when authors can achieve that balance, giving just enough for you to think you've got it, but leaving just enough out for you to be surprised in the end. This was the case with Daughter of Smoke and Bone. It was a perfect blend of romance, adventure, and suspense. I cannot wait to read more from Laini!"
535,"Daughter of Smoke & Bone (Daughter of Smoke & Bone, #1)",0316134023,Laini Taylor,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Saint_Trinity,"This book was amazing! I've been kind of wary of the fantasy genre lately, because most stories are stereotypical and redundant. But the cover caught my eye, so I decided to check it out. And I was not disappointed. While the basic idea of an angel and demon falling in love is nothing new, Taylor wrote it in the way it always should have been: dark, intriguing, complex, and unique. The plot had plenty of twists and turns without being overly confusing. The setting was clear and distinctive. 
But the best part were the characters. Karou is what every teenage girl wants to be: witty, mysterious, dangerous, and lovely, without being too perfect. Brimstone and the other demons so embody what you want them to be that you can practically see them, sitting in your living room and drinking coffee. While Akiva is described as beautiful, he's not even close to a sparkle fairy. Instead, he's got enough of the avenging angel aspect to be formidable. 
I would definitely recommend this story for anyone who's fed up of the average fantasy/paranormal romance but isn't ready to give up hope on the genre."
536,"Red Queen (Red Queen, #1)",1409151174,Victoria Aveyard,Barnes and Noble,4.4,BookLoversLife1,"Red Queen can be summed up in one word..... EPIC!! I absolutely adored this book. 

What can I say to do this book justice! I think I'll start with some of my favourite things. 

The world building was phenomenal. The idea that you are graded, basically, by the colour of your blood. There are the lowly Reds, they are the work force and masses of the world. They do the dirty work and are treated accordingly. Then you have the &quot;mighty&quot; Silvers. They are the elite, they have wealth and powers beyond measure. They treat any one under them with derision and don't care who they hurt. I loved the idea of this and how the colour of your blood matters. In a world saturated in books, it's rare enough you will find a truly unique and amazing world. Well Red Queen has it all!! 

The Silvers powers were also amazing. Man, they had some cool powers!! Some could manipulate water, some electricity, some metal, some fire etc. Each family had a unique one and I loved seeing them in action. 

Then we have the characters. Mare is a lowly Red but she has a fighters spirit and hates the Silvers. She is due to conscript to the army when she turns of age but when her best friend says he is to go soon, she decides that, enough is enough, and tries to buy them passage to anywhere other than where they are. By a twist of fate though, she ends up meeting someone who gets her a job in the palace. She thinks if she takes it she may be able to help her people. What she doesn't know is things come to light in ways she couldn't imagine and she is thrown into palace life. Mare was such a plucky girl but yet she is so naive at times and trusts too easy. All she wants is for a normal life but when you can't do anything for yourself and you are treated like dirt, it wears on you. She wants to do whats best, but at what cost?? 

We have 2 Princes, the Kings heir and favourite, Cal and his younger step brother and Mares rock during her time at the palace, Maven. Cal is like all future Kings and knows his own mind, he is strong, brave and idealistic, though maybe with the wrong ideals. Mare feels drawn to him and wants so much for him to help her, but can she trust him?

Maven on the other hand is kind and nice to Mare all the time and will do anything to help her. She can't help but like his easy going and kind manner and ends up relying on him more and more. He is the brother living in the shadow of a greater brother and Mare feels for him. 

Now, I suppose you could say that there is a love triangle in Red Queen, though Mares' feelings are plain for all to see, so I'm not sure if I can call it a love triangle! I normally hate them in books but because this is necessary to the story and Mare isn't torn between them, I didn't mind. 

Now I could keep gushing about the book but I better wrap it up!! Lol. Red Queen is one of those books that you want to read for the first time again. It blew me away and I'm impatiently awaiting the next one. There is so much in this book to love. It is action packed, unique, full of twits and turns and with gasp out loud moments. Believe me, I gasped at a certain part because I was fooled too!! The Queen is the epitome of Evil and very very cunning. There is so much you don't see till it's too late, that I was left reeling. It's a unique and captivating read and one that will stay with me forever. Those characters stole a piece of my heart and I need book 2 like yesterday. What else can I say about this magnificent piece of writing other that, go buy it now!!!"
536,"Red Queen (Red Queen, #1)",1409151174,Victoria Aveyard,Barnes and Noble,4.4,book4children,"It was okay. I can't decide if my feelings on this book are mixed or simply non-existent.  The concept was interesting, but I've read this same story before in other YA books.  Red Queen didn't bring anything new to the table and I'm tired of angry, outspoken protagonists. I didn't connect with the characters, and none of the twists managed to surprise me. I almost quit reading several times, but I'm glad I didn't because the second half of the book was much better than the first.

Even though this book was predictable, it still managed to keep me turning pages. If you haven't read a lot of young adult novels, you may like this book better than I did. After all, the writing flows easily and the story follows a nice arc. There is plenty of action, betrayal, and emotional drama going on. It is violent, but not gory.  There are a couple of curse words, but the romantic element is kept very clean.

I'm chalking this one up to personal taste. I think a lot of people will like this book, but it didn't knock my socks off.

Content: Violence, 2 or 3 curse words.

I thought the characters were undeveloped and  predictable. I never connected with Mare and the romances she developed seemed to come out of no where. Plot was interesting and would have been a great series to read but I couldn't get passed how Mare seemed so pathetic all the time. Take charge girl! Also seemed to jump in time without any real transition. Overall, good plot, bad character development."
537,The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business,1400069289,Charles Duhigg,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Ronrose,"My usual habit is to pick up a mystery novel and engross myself in the imagined problems of nonfiction characters. I decided to change this habit and try this nonfiction book with the rather intriguing title that professed to help identify our habits and show us how to change them. Habits are those things we initially choose to do, which have evolved, through repeated use into things we do without thinking. Written in language even I can understand, the book breaks down the pattern of habits into three parts that we can recognize and change. The author illustrates that by first identifying components of a habit, we can then work to change them. This is a self help book that may actually be of some help, if we want to change. This book was provided for review by Random House. Now, where did I put that mystery novel?"
537,The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business,1400069289,Charles Duhigg,Barnes and Noble,4.1,EthanJonesMBA,"In this wonderful book, Charles Duhigg, an investigative reporter for The New York Times, tackles an important reality head on. That is, people succeed when they identify patterns that shape their lives--and learn how to change them. This idea--that you can indeed change your habits--draws on recent research in experimental psychology, neurology, and applied psychology. My chief complaint is he doesn't really show you how to break bad habits. For this you should consider Emotional Intelligence 2.0. That book was great for my self-control. As you can see from the TOC below, Duhigg really goes after a broad range of topics. He looks at the habits of individuals, how habits operate in the brain, how companies use them, and how retailers use habits to manipulate buying habits. This provides some fascinating research and stories, such as the fact that grocery stores put fruits and vegetables at the front of the store because people who put these healthy items in their carts are more apt to buy junk food as well before they leave the store. The author's main contention is that ""you have the freedom and responsibility"" to remake your habits. He says ""the most addicted alcoholics can become sober. The most dysfunctional companies can transform themselves. A high school dropout can become a successful manager."" He makes a convincing case for all this. The only problem is that's all he does. He doesn't show you how to do it. PART ONE: THE HABITS OF INDIVIDUALS 1. The Habit Loop - How Habits Work 2. The Craving Brain - How to Create New Habits 3.

It was so boring to read story after story with the same diagrams over and over. Just wasn't what I expected."
538,Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,0679751521,John Berendt,Barnes and Noble,4.1,slimikin,"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is a splendid piece of nonfiction. Part true crime, part Savannah guidebook, it reaches beyond both of these to become a captivating character study. John Berendt effortlessly captures the voices of both the people he meets and the city of Savannah, itself. And yet, though his impressions and experiences shape the narrative, he remains an understated presence in the book, offering what he sees and hears with minimal commentary, and leaving us, the readers, with the sense that it is we who are in fact meeting these people and this place. As their new acquaintances, moreover, we're free and welcome to come to our own conclusions about the quality of their characters, and so we, too, become drawn into the book's singular series of events. Deftly rendered with elegant and evocative prose, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is a funny, insightful, and often touching glimpse into Savannah's charming, mysterious heart."
538,Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,0679751521,John Berendt,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,I loved this book! The chareacters and plot are very original and catching. I think that way the book is written draws you in and makes you want to keep reading and the way he describes Savannah makes you want to move there or at lease visit. The characters are all colorful and you love them. This is a good book for someone who likes mystery and comedy.
538,Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,0679751521,John Berendt,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"In the book every moment seems to lead up to main plot. The book is very organized and easy to read. The characters in the book are very different than normal characters and it is what captures your interest to start with. My favorite character would have to be Chablis, just because of her attitude and personality. In the town of Savannah, it would be very peaceful and I believe that the author portraid the town very well. It's easy to picture in your mind, even if you don't have a creative imagination. The ending was well rounded, but it possibly could have added what every one was doing in the end of the book."

I felt very sad when sara crewe's father died. This book is the best book even though i didnt read it on my nook. Thank you for reading my review.
540,A Little Princess,0142437018,"Frances Hodgson Burnett, Nancy Bond",Barnes and Noble,4.4,CheesyPrincess,"A Little Princess, originally written by Frances Hodgson Burnett about a century ago is a classic, that girls of all ages will simply adore. A Little Princess tells the story of young, clever Sara Crewe, who arrives in England with her father from India, in order to attend Miss Minchin's School for Girls, which is a boarding school. At the school, Sara is richer than all the other girls and her room is filled with finery the other girls don't have. She even has her own maid, Mariette! She also becomes the smartest girl in school, which causes another girl, Lavinia Herbert, to hate Sara out of jealousy. But instead of being spoiled or bragging about her smarts, Sara compliments others on their own talents and strengths, and is not spoiled at all, but nice, and tries to help others in need. Sara even befriends a poor fourteen-year old scullery maid, Becky, and sara also tels stories to the other girls. She wins many friends, and soon the whole school, including mean, cranky Miss Minchin are calling Sara ""princess"". Soon, four years pass by at the school, and Sara is now ce;ebrating her eleventh birthday. But before the celebrating can begin, Miss Minchin is called to her office. Miss Minchin learns that Sara's father has died and he hadn't left any money to Sara, because he had lost all his money. Furious on everything she had spent for Sara's sake, Miss Minchin cacels the party and forces Sara to dress in rags and become a scullery maid, like Becky, nad luve in the attic. Sara now has to work very hard, and is very lonely. But when it seemed like Sara had lost everything, an unexpected twist of events come up, and Sara finds true happiness at last. I think this is an educational and entertaining classic for girls, since we can relate to it so well. Any girl out there who is looking for a classic to read, I highly recommend A Little Princess. It certainly deserves five stars! Thank you Frances Hodgson Burnett for such a wonderful and inspiring tale!"

541,The Truth About Forever,0142406252,Sarah Dessen,Barnes and Noble,4.7,readtolive_livetoread,"Sarah Dessen is a good writer, creating believable and relatable characters that very adequately reflect what teens are like. My favorite part of the books I've read by her is the dialogue, which, if you examine carefully, is unique to whichever character she's writing about. Sarah creates well-rounded characters. And it's probably her biggest skill.
Macy Queen is quite a confused young woman. Her father died, and grief-stricken Macy keeps blaming herself. Worse, she comes to think that if she can just keep things at a constant, that is, perfectly still, she can control her life. And that's her biggest flaw: this unfailing faith in perfection that she simply won't snap out of.
Enter Wes and the whole Wish Catering crew. They help Macy come to life-altering realizations about the controlled forever she keeps thinking she can attain. Wes, especially, helps her see that the future--the eventual forever--is about changes and imperfections and learning from your mistakes, not a present that moves forward with time, never changing.
The story had a nice message. It was well written. The characters--Wes, in particular--were for the most part great. I don't know how else to elaborate on it, because, to me, this book speaks for itself."

Lewis does an excellent job combining wit, humor, and adventure in one book! I loved the Magician's Nephew and The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe but, The Horse and His Boy is probably my favorite! I loved the ending and how Lewis creates a futuristic image at the end of each book in the Chronicles of Narnia! Talking Beasts and Animals, Kings and Queens, and smart-alecky wit and humor make The Horse and His Boy and the Chronicles of Narnia a classic hit!"

542,"The Horse and His Boy (Chronicles of Narnia, #5)",0439861365,C.S. Lewis,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"The Horse and His Boy is one of the most well-written books I have ever read! It is funny, serious, and always keeps you on end! The beginning is about how a boy is growing up as a slave, but he feels as if there is something more to his life. Throughout the book, the boy goes on a journey north to see who he really is. The way C.S. Lewis portrays his companions and describes the happenings as the boy goes along is unbelievable. The descriptions of how he feels when he rides a horse for the first time are very accurate to reality. Phrases like 'the wind in his hair' and 'his sore legs from the saddle' can help any reader to picture the story in their own imagination. Although very interesting and exciting, this book was only slightly boring on a few pages. There is a saying that goes, 'less talk more action'. I believe that quote could be applied here. He doesn't need to explain all the things happening as 'they rode along in the night, silently'. We as young readers, enjoy movement and we like to be kept in suspense. He could elaborate a little less and 'speed it up to the part about the battle'. I would reccomend this book to anyone the age of nine years or older because I enjoyed it and all of C.S. Lewis's books excellent for all ages too."
543,"Last Sacrifice (Vampire Academy, #6)",1595143068,Richelle Mead,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Katie26,"As far as I know, this is the summary for this book: ""Murder. Love. Jealousy. And the ultimate sacrifice. Now, with Rose on trial for her life and Lissa first in line for the Royal Throne, nothing will ever be the same between them.""

I can't wait for it to come out! I like Adrian as a character, but I am not sure that I like him with Rose. Dimitri obviously still loves her, but then again, Adrian does too. I just hope that this series doesn't turn out like the House of Night books where the girl has like four boyfriends. I hope she chooses one, and I hope it's Dimitri. He and her had planned a life together and they need to live it. I don't think it could ever work between her and Adrian, sorry to say.

I also am really curious about who killed Tatiana. I reread Spirit Bound like, five times and couldn't figure it out. It couldn't have been Victor Dashkov because there is no way he could get into Court to do it. But then it had to be someone close to Rose to be able to take her stake. I was sort of thinking Ambrose, but I also don't think that it was him. I just can't wait for Last Sacrifice! There was such a big cliff hanger and unresolved questions and emotions. This series is so amazing and I just want to keep rereading them!"

Now that I am an adult, I am finding myself buying the series again and cant wait to open the first book, and continue reading until the 9th book is finished.

The title of the book is Little House on the Prairie, and the author is  Laura Ingalls Wilder. There are many major characters in the book, Pa, Ma, Mary, Laura, and baby Carrie. Pa is also known as Charles he, is the father of the family and Ma also known as Caroline, is the mother. The oldest child is Mary, the second oldest is Laura and the youngest is baby Carrie. The family is heading south, during the colonial period. They end up staying on a dry prairie which just happens to have wolves near by. After they find out there are wolves they find out there are Indians near by also. Will the wolves attack or will the Indians invade, who knows?		My first impression of this book was, ¿Oh it will be ok,¿ but, now that I have started reading the book, I think it is rather interesting. The book is exciting and wonderful. I liked the book because it is so lively and vibrant, with lots of details. For example, Laura Ingalls Wilder described the prairie to have tall, long, dry, grass. And a wide blue sky with no clouds in site, just a blazing sun over the prairie. 				I would recommend this book to anyone that likes the colonial period. The author uses great transitioning words, which makes the book flow really well. She has inspired me with her writing. For example she would not say the bird is blue. She would say the little bird is a shaded of blue, and in the far away distance you can hear the sweet song echoing over the hills and valleys. If you are into  long detailed books this is not the book for you!"

546,Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry Into Values,0060589469,Robert M. Pirsig,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,"The first of Robert Maynard Pirsig's two books, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is neither primarily focused on zen nor motorcycle maintenance but is a nonfiction account of the author's search for truth.  More symbolic of the manifestation of Pirsig's philosophies, the concepts of zen and motorcycles are used to demonstrate the author's theories so that the reader can better visualize his ideas.      Serving as the book's main organizational device, the motorcycle trip lasts for seventeen days beginning in Minnesota and ending in California.  This quest motif seems to be representative of the author's larger search for truth, for identity, and for quality.      Interspersed throughout the story of the author's journey through the mountains are what he likes to call Chautauquas:  philosophical thoughts pertaining to life, human nature, humanity's relationship with technology, and the ever-elusive concept of quality, which is the book's main focus.  The philosophical aspects make the book worth your time and somehow more sophisticated.  The narrative aspects provides interest and gives you a break from all the deep concepts presented.  The autobiographical aspects cause a relationship between the author and yourself to form.    Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance can be a perplexing book and a struggle to get through.  In the beginning of the book, before you've adjusted to this unusual style of the author, you can't help but wonder as what this book's purpose is, be confused at this structure which you had never seen before, and even question the sanity of the author.     Then, as a reader you become accustomed to Pirsig's writing style.  You begin to look at things differently, where you don't look so much as to what the words are but what they mean.  And after becoming accustomed to his unusual style, you learn to appreciate it.  His use of narrative structure makes it seem as if the author is just now experiencing all of these thoughts and discovering all of these truths.  Pirsig portrays himself to be in the act of philosophizing, in the act of his experiential struggles, not simply telling the reader afterward when the action is finished and the thought has ceased.  As a reader, you feel as if you are experiencing these revelations in concurrence with him.      Pirsig invites you to step into the next level of thinking but still allows you to formulate your own personal viewpoints and opinions.  He doesn't write above the level of the average person, yet manages to not oversimplify things as if he's addressing ignorance.      Before reading this book, I perceived the concepts which he discusses to be way above my level, perhaps because they simply are too complex for me or perhaps because I lack the patience to really sit down and examine them.  Somehow, Pirsig made these topics more understandable.  However, this is not to be confused with effortless.  He does not make the topics easy and simple, but he makes them more accessible to an ordinary person like myself.  He allows you to have the opportunity to look at and dissect these things, to relate them to your own thoughts and life, to have its own profound impact on you.      There is still much confusion, times of frustration, endless hours of thinking about these concepts that just go around and around in your mind.  There is still all of this, but there is no confusion as to what these topics are, just the marvelous confusion of what these topics mean.  Personally, my perception of the theme was that changing your concept of the world and of life can change the world and life itself.  Looking at things from a different point of view, a point of view not tainted by sociey's perception of right and wrong and normal, a point of view not tarnished by structure and routine, a point of view completely new and fresh, can do wonders.      Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is the type of book that stays with you long after you've finished reading it."

The narrator's journey to reeunite with his wife in the mist of the Martians arrival on Earth is extremely interesting to read. Also, the Martians themselves are new and different than anything that most have heard, or read, of before. The only downside of this wonderful novel is the author of the endnotes.

548,"Pretty Little Liars (Pretty Little Liars, #1)",0060887303,Sara Shepard,Barnes and Noble,4.5,AJourneyOfBooks,"Often described as a mix between I Know What You Did Last Summer and Desperate Housewives PRETTY LITTLE LIARS by Sara Shepard promised to be an exciting and suspenseful read.  Sure enough, it met and exceeded all of my expectations.  

The first thing that I will say about this book is that I was really expecting something a little more superficial and juvenile.  I had never read anything by Ms. Shepard before, so I didn't know what to expect.  What I received was a book that would be great for any teen and most adults I know.  Ms. Shepard's writing is far from juvenile and made for a story that had me hooked from the first few lines.  

Sounds good right?  Girl goes missing and eventually her friends get on with their lives.  Well, if this were the end of the story, the book would be about seven pages long. No, Ms. Shepard isn't going to let you off that easily.  Tossed into the chaos right from the beginning of the book, the girls each separately start to receive mysterious text messages signed by ""A"".  As they attempt to figure out who ""A"" is, the messages get more and more disturbing, some hinting at secrets that only the missing Allison knew.

Cue the suspenseful music!

So really though, if I could have had a suspense soundtrack playing while I read this book, I'm fairly certain that I would have jumped out of my seat in shock a few times.  This was a beautifully crafted book with a well thought out plot line that easily hooks readers and then draws them in.  The complexity of the story was what really made this a great read and I can't imagine the amount of time and planning that went into crafting the various plot twists and turns that pop up throughout the pages.  Think you know something about someone?  I can pretty much guarantee that by the next page you'll be proven wrong.  When everyone is suspect, who can you trust?  Ms. Shepard answers that one for us - nobody.

One part of PRETTY LITTLE LIARS that may trip a few people up are the varying points of view throughout the story.  Each chapter is really told from a different girl's point of view although they all aren't necessarily labeled by girl.  Still, I found it fairly easy to figure out who's chapter we were in and didn't really notice too much of a disconnect between the four stories when reading.  Ms. Shepard does an amazing job with her consistency; although each girl's chapter takes place in different places and settings, they tie together well and occasionally we even see just a little bit of overlap.  

The last part of the book that I briefly need to discuss is the character development.  In a book like this, especially for the first in a series, character development is vital to a successful story.  Ms. Shepard did this wonderfully.  My proof is in the way that the characters, Spencer especially, still roam through my mind, picking at my brain when I have little else to do.

I highly recommend PRETTY LITTLE LIARS to any fans of drama or YA fiction out there.  Looking for a good thriller?  I would definitely point to this book.  Although filled with topics that young adults can relate to, I don't see much here that would turn an adult off from the book.  Indeed, I think adults too will very much appreciate the adrenaline rush this book provides."

I'm not proud to admit it, but, even though I read a lot of sociology, politics, and history, there are some things which inherently make me nervous. Food culture is one of them. This book is truly important. It might not change your view about what you are eating, but it will inform you of the consequences of each decision. I didn't find the book preachy or overdone; I found it stimulating. However, the section on industrial agriculture made me wonder how things got so bad politically. I mean, I guess I know how they did. I just hope that Michael Pollan is right...maybe we are moving in a more transparent direction, in which we start understanding our relationship with nature is extremely complex. Maybe we will admit our ignorance and move towards an more sustainable and healthy future."

However, I also am aware of the paradox - I was only able to make such fine (in the surprised words of my wife) meals because I was off from work and had the time to make broiled shark steak with fresh local corn, carrots and string beans; pork chops with local cherry and onion sauce with sauteed local zucchini and toasted almonds; and veal sausage with local peppers, onions and garlic with a salad of local lettuces, tomatoes, cucumbers and scallions.  Hungry yet?  That's how I felt after reading this book.  I knew about the horrors of industrial farming, particularly with regards to meat, but the history of how we became so fixated on corn and what it has meant for our diets and the environment was truly compelling.  Needless to say, the grass farmer section and the foraging section made me wish I could partake in such a lifestyle."

551,Life After Life,0316176486,Kate Atkinson,Barnes and Noble,3.6,lovelybookshelf,"When I first read the synopsis of Kate Atkinson's Life After Life, I immediately wondered how Ursula Todd would come back to life. Would it be like Captain Jack Harkness in the television series Torchwood, where moments after death she'd revive with a huge gasp for air? Would it be more like the movie Groundhog Day, with all the frustration that came with not being able to escape the loop? Would she be aware of what was happening? Would other people be aware of it happening to her? No matter how many possibilities I envisioned, I was still surprised by the way Kate Atkinson crafted this plot point. It is handled with ingenuity and originality; never cheesy, never trite. I'm purposely being vague here, because I don't want to spoil it for anyone. But I think every time I feel d&eacute;j&agrave; vu in the future, I'll be reminded of this novel...

Much of the story took place in London during the bombings (the &quot;Blitz&quot;) of WWII. These pages were terrifying and heart-wrenching. I would start to feel overwhelmed and think, &quot;Is this ever going to stop?&quot; I'd want to put the book down for a while, and then feel guilty. I'd been reading over the course of only two days, and could take a break whenever I wanted. London had 57 nights in a row of bombings. Atkinson gives readers an incredibly vivid portrayal of war, a poignant and multifaceted look at its enormity and how distressing - and wearying - it is for all involved.

Life After Life is beautifully written and reads like a classic. Wonderfully complex, it's a story you could read over and over and always make new connections.

I received a copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. I did not receive any other compensation for this review."

On that same cold and snowy night, Ursula Todd is born, lets out a lusty wail, and embarks upon a life that will be, to say the least, unusual. For as she grows, she also dies, repeatedly, in any number of ways. Clearly history (and Kate Atkinson) have plans for her: In Ursula rests nothing less than the fate of civilization.&quot;

Facing the unknown, reincarnation and ownership for our actions or passivity is a fascinating backdrop to this wildly powerful tale that courses through different time periods in England and Europe's 20th century. It was so easy to be caught up in Ursula's many lives; I got the same rush of excitement and anticipation as I did when reading the &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&rdquo; book series in the 80&rsquo;s as a young girl! I highly recommend &ldquo;Life After Life&rdquo;, as it was thoroughly engaging and engrossing &ndash; which is the marking of a phenomenal book!"
551,Life After Life,0316176486,Kate Atkinson,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Anonymous,"This was a selection for our book club, and I have to say it isn't one I would have picked myself, nor would I read it again.  The premise is very intriguing and the history and writing are well done.  The explanation of the ""deja vu"" and how Ursula moves past a previous obstacle each time she starts over were very well done. However, about halfway through, the story just became mundane, and while a lot of it lended to the history of the time period Ursula lived in, I felt that the more important parts of the plot were lost in boring daily detail. It also became a little jumbled at the end, and i'm not quite sure i really understand what happened or why it happened in the end after all.  If you just want ot give something different a try, a chance to read outside the box, give it a shot. But dont expect a riveting story."
552,The Rescue,0446696129,Nicholas Sparks,Barnes and Noble,4.4,ilovechar,"WOW! This would have to be one of the best books I've read in awhile. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the author or is just looking for a fantastic book, which keeps you on your toes.  picked it up every free second I had. Once again Nicholas Sparks keeps on pleasing his readers.This novel includes all of his writing trademarks, secretive pasts, a new love, tragedy, and a pleasing but shocking end. One day Denise and her speaking impaired son Kyle were in a tragic accident. Then Taylor, a volunteer fireman came along Denise and rescues Kyle. After some time together, they both have to face their pasts in order to make their love for each other to work out. Taylor tries to overcome the guilt of the tragic losses of two important people in his life and learning how to love and stay committed to a woman. Denise learns to let go of her wounded pasts and fears of her mother, Kyle's dad, Kyle, and letting someone get close to him.So in my opinion, from the ones I've read, The Rescue would be one of the best books Nicholas Sparks has written. I would put on my list of my top five favorite books. I loved the book and didn't find one negative thing about it. Every time you turn the page, something more shocking and unexpected happens. More secrets are revealed.If you're looking forward to reading a wonderful romance, then you should read this book. I promise you will love it. It's a wonderful book and ties the plots and characters perfectly together to form a marvelous love story.Read it, and when you finish, you won't be disappointed."

553,Needful Things,045057458X,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"While working at a bookstore, I decided that I needed to read one sci-fi and one romance novel just to get a feel for the genre. I selected Diana Gabaldon's ""Outlander"" for the romance novel, and was absolutely captivated by her story and style. I devoured the first three books in less than six weeks--an amazing feat for me as a slow reader with sight impairments--and have started at least 200 people on these books since then. I have had exactly two negative reactions.Voyager, as I said above, is my favorite of all the books so far. In the last 300 pages or so, Gabaldon's plot moves at breathtaking speed, tying up many ends. The conclusion is stunning. In a year when real time/distance travel is curtailed by high gasoline prices, the ""Outlander"" series--and ""Voyager"" in particular--is a mental escape of the first order. If you need some place to go on your ""staycation,"" I would strongly suggest Scotland in the mid-1700's, and a visit with Jamie and Clare Fraser. You won't be disappointed."
553,Needful Things,045057458X,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.5,pagese,"At the start of this book, I was afraid it wasn't going to live up to the first two. It took me awhile to figure out why I wasn't liking it as much. While I enjoyed learning about Jamie and Claire after they were separated, it's the two of them together that make this series so special. And then I realized that story of their 20 years apart is important too. As a reader we need to understand how much of an influence they had on one another. That even after 20 years (not to mention 2 centuries), they still hold those outstanding feelings for each other. But, I have to admit, that moment in the print shop was what I was waiting for! This book takes you on a ride. It's not stop action with all that heart stopping romance in between. It's suspenseful, and at times I really wondered if Jamie and/or Claire was going to get out of whatever situation they managed to find themselves in. It had some major shocks and twists in it, things that I was down right not expecting. And, at times I wondered if 20 years of separation was just too much to overcome. At the end of the story, I was left with a book that rivals my first love of Outlander! I was amazed at the story Diana Gabaldon has managed to create."
553,Needful Things,045057458X,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.5,SassaFrass2044,"Voyager was just as addictive as the first two in the Outlander series!  Not as totally indulgent as Outlander....but then again...there's nothing like the first...is there?  With that being said, I was completely satisfied with the plot and the further development of the characters.  She kept the main characters true and human.  I also liked how Gabaldon decided to write about the 20 years in past tense versus taking us through the entire 20 years. Liked all of the new characters.  There was still lots of adventure....although I noticed she lessened with the sex scenes; which I thought was appropriate.  It made the few so much more enduring! Also, even though the characters are 20 years older their passions are just as true...which is true to life.  I could honestly stop reading here (hah! fat chance) because of how Voyager ended.  Although I must say a lot will have to do with the fact that I am totally sleep deprived and on the verge of a divorce (hehehe....slightly compulsive).  My husband keeps saying ""I can't believe I have 3 more books to go!"" However, it's Christmas and if you can't read at Christmas when can you?  I've started my husband on the 2nd book in the series and he is thoroughly hooked - job done!  I will definitely be packing the light blue book for my road trip! Voyager is a great read!"

556,Cujo,0307348245,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"I say first, Eugenides is a great storyteller. Well written, draws you in, descriptive. But this  is not a great story. These boys aren't realistic, holding hands, fretting about the neighbor girls, stealing their stuff (makeup? Shoes?) to idolize it. Weird boys worshipping weirder girls for no apparent reason other than they have to to make the book go. Nothing gets resolved but luckily there wasnt a big mystery to begin with so i didnt care. I felt depressed by the end--i'm not looking for happy endings when i read, but also not looking for anticlimactic absence of caring.

I happened to open it up when I had nothing else to read & ""BAM"" I was hooked!! I find Sookie an absolute delight. I love reading about each & every new & different species she manages to come across. She is serious where she should be & light hearted where it's appropriate. I'm so happy that Sookie & Eric get together in this book, since I've always been rather partial to him.

If you love this series, check out True Blood on HBO.  It strays a bit from the books but still a great show to watch!"
558,"Dead to the World (Sookie Stackhouse, #4)",0441012183,Charlaine Harris,Barnes and Noble,3.8,theokester,"Tess is one of the more depressive novels I've read lately. My wife will attest to the fact that I have a strange affinity to depressing stories. With that in mind, let me say that I really enjoyed this book. 

The writing was at times a bit too much for me for the reason that I get annoyed at many 18th and 19th century novels...namely, that Hardy focuses far too much on minute descriptions and in-depth analysis of setting and location. Don't get me wrong, I love a vivid and lush environment and I much prefer a fleshed out character to a flat one. I just sometimes feel that all of the flowery descriptions slow down the story telling element too much. There were a few paragraphs/pages that I tried to skim through in order to get to the next relevant points of plot. Still, I don't know that I'd want to edit out the descriptive text since it does comment on the narrative itself in a metafictional sort of way. 

The main characters in this book are wonderfully composed. They are absolutely and completely frustrating but they are superbly crafted nonetheless. I wanted to smack each of the main characters on many occasions. 

Tess is far too willing to simply be acted upon and then to bemoan her fate. Alec is an absolute pig (although towards the end of our experience with him, it's debatable just how awful he truly is). And Angel is far too inconsistent to be liked at all...at first he seems almost lovable...then he deserves to be hated...then he seems slightly adequate...then he becomes repulsive again...he's just far too wishy-washy in his behavior and ideals to ever be fully redeemable. 

The story itself falls into the realm of realism taken to its extreme. The plot elements felt almost like the Bible story of Job...whatever could go wrong willgo wrong. And even though Tess was generally found to be almost whining about her circumstances rather than trying to make things better for herself, the story was still rather thought provoking since it makes you wonder just how you would handle horrific circumstances and what can truly be done about them. Is it better to try and solve the problem or better to just let fate and happenstance take its toll. 

Personally, I try to make the best out of any bad situation...perhaps that's why I like ""depressing"" stories...they make me realize my life could be worse and they help inspire me to always think of the best possible outcome. 

I'm sure this book won't be for everyone. Those who want a happy fairy-tale romp through a girl's life would do better to stay away. Those who are easily frustrated by fallen characters, will find themselves hating all of the primary roles in this book. The book isn't terribly lengthy (~300-400?) but some of the longer descriptive passages do crawl by at times. 

Still, I whole-heartedly recommend this book to those who are willing to look imperfection and awful situations square in the face and come away smiling. It's not a happy book. It's not a terribly fast past book (which can also be frustrating...I wanted to shout Just do it to Tess many times). 

But it is a wonderfully rich book and definitely worth getting into."

559,Tess of the D'Urbervilles,0141439599,"Thomas Hardy, Tim Dolin, Margaret R. Higonnet",Barnes and Noble,3.2,cranmergirl on LibraryThing,"While I enjoyed the writing and was entertained by the story, I could not relate to the protagonist of this classic novel in any way.  If Flaubert was truly Emma Bovary, as he famously said, that is quite sad for him!  There was not much to like about her.  She was shallow, pretentious and totally self-absorbed.  Some reviewers have pointed out that Emma Bovary was trapped in a bad situation due to her gender and the social conventions of her time.  While that may be true, there was nothing noble or sympathetic about the character of Madame Bovary.  She continually and selfishly pursued her self-destructive quest for ""love"" while ignoring what was right in front of her the whole time, a husband and child who truly loved her."
559,Tess of the D'Urbervilles,0141439599,"Thomas Hardy, Tim Dolin, Margaret R. Higonnet",Barnes and Noble,3.2,technodiabla on LibraryThing,"This book was a surprisingly easy and quick read (the Francis Steegmuller translation).  Flaubert shows himself to be a master of finding the perfect phrase, perfect term, perfect analogy to describe, well, everything.  But in particular, the female psyche, thought processes, and emotions.  The novel is divided into three parts that more or less reflect the three phases of Madame Bovary's downfall.  After the first I loved her.  After the second you start to think she is pathetic.  By the end you're pretty much through with her-- as is everyone else, except Charles.  Despite this story being known as a tale of adultery, I felt it was more of a cautionary tale of excess and self control.  Her lack of self control-- with money at least as much as with love-- is what led to her downfall.  There are lots of interesting comparisons to Lily Bart and House of Mirth.  (I liked Lily and HoM much better than Emma.)  On the whole I liked the book, especially the writing, but it was hard to muster any sympathy for the characters (except Berthe).  Even Charles, in the end, just fell to pieces and really was the bland weakling that Emma hated him for being.  Also, the end of the book-- post Emma's death-- was odd, like it didn't quite fit.  It seemed like Homais was being demonized but it wasn't clear to me why.  Madame Bovary is a must read for the writing and the novels' influence, but I think there are better similar novels out there."
559,Tess of the D'Urbervilles,0141439599,"Thomas Hardy, Tim Dolin, Margaret R. Higonnet",Barnes and Noble,3.2,cdeuker on LibraryThing,"I read and enjoyed this years ago, but this time I was simply amazed by the quality of the writing.  Physical description, psychological description, comedy, tragedy--a master of it all.  Also a unique book in that there is not one major or minor character who is remotely likable, and yet they are all completely realistic.  What does that say about our world?  (I also wonder--if this book reads as if it has been written by God in translation, what must it be like in the original?)"

561,The Phantom Tollbooth,0394820371,"Norton Juster, Jules Feiffer",Barnes and Noble,4.7,Mavis1129,"I don't read a lot of fantasy but I loved the Mistborn series and Warbreaker.  You can tell from the start that this book is the beginning of something epic.  The story follows several characters, some so minor, you wonder why they're even mentioned.  Each chapter you get a snippet of what's happened in the past, what's currently happening, and what is going to happen.  Be prepared to get halfway through this 1000 page novel before you really start to see things fall into place and the action to really start happening.  By the time I was finished, I didn't want it to end.  I had misgivings at the start but by the end, I was sucked in.  I HAVE to see what happens next!"
561,The Phantom Tollbooth,0394820371,"Norton Juster, Jules Feiffer",Barnes and Noble,4.7,JeremyShane,"This book (and series) has the makings of one of the all time great fantasy series. I felt the same way reading this as when I sat reading ""The Wheel of Time"" or ""Game of Thrones"" for the first time. There are plenty of good fantasy stories out there, enough variety for anyone; but this is high fantasy done at it's best.

It took me a little time to get started on this. I was sick the last week and nyquil and late reading don't seem to mix well. As this cold is fading I've been able to dig in and finish it the last couple days. Partly because of the addicting nature of the story as well.

As someone who loves characters first and foremost, every character in this book is well done. Kaladin was the character I got into quickest, others took a bit longer for me to form that eagerness for; but eventually they all came to the same level.

His world feels nearly alien in it's uniqueness. Not something I require of my fantasy, but knowing this is going to be a ten book series it's nice to see. He does such a good job with fleshing out the world that by the end, it really doesn't feel alien anymore. In fact at one point a good way through they come to an area that seems fairly ""earthlike"" and the characters there find it odd and I was right along with them.

The plot is exactly what it should be for something that will last ten books and probably over a decade of writing. Epic. The single novel itself reads well enough and wraps up well enough, but you still feel like you read the first chapter and want more. Not so much because of major cliffhangers, but because you are involved in the world and the characters and want to stay there. Sanderson does an outstanding job of weaving the plots together as it moves forward.

The magic is unique, well done and well explained. Still more left on the table to learn; but I feel like the reader got plenty to understand what was happening and how. Most of all it fits the world's unique feel.

Outside of the overall review, I have to say a couple things I normally don't like in fantasies: Odd quotes that don't make sense under chapter titles and prophecies and guidance by godlike figures that are more riddles than anything else. Both of these were in the book and handled beautifully. The prophecy thing when it finally crested most I nearly started to get frustrated, when the explanation came and it all made sense (more sense than any other time I've seen it tried). and, Once you are into the story you understand the purpose of the quotes and they just become additional artwork.

Speaking of artwork, I loved all the extras in this book. Of course it had the map many fantasy stories have, but it also had drawings throughout the story of cities, creatures and other sketches (work that looked like you were peaking into sketchbooks of that world, not just standard art). It also had nice headers to every chapter.

I can't recommend this story enough if you are a true fantasy fan. Especially if you like series like the Wheel of Time (fitting he is finishing that for Jordan) and a Song of Fire and Ice."

Craig is highly ambitious, spending his entire middle school career studying to get into an elite high school. Once there, Craig realizes maybe he isn't so smart after all. He has to work twice as hard as his classmates just to get by. All this pressure causes Craig to suffer from depression, preventing him from sleeping or eating. On a particularly bad night after Craig stops taking his medication, he nearly kills himself, deciding to call the suicide hotline at the last moment. From there, Craig spends the next five days in a mental hospital, possibly the most influential five days of his life. He learns to eat and sleep again, he creates friendships, discovers a passion for drawing, and he finally confronts the reason as to why he is so unhappy. 

I loved this book. For a book about depression, it was amazingly light-hearted. The tone was clever and humorous and very real. The cast of the novel was original and entertaining. Craig himself was a brilliant character. I don't have depression, yet could sympathize with Craig on so many levels. Craig is a teenage boy, and acts like one. He makes mistakes, but every now and then has a moment of insightful clarity. 

The topic of depression and mental illness was treated carefully. These people were messed up, but never seemed inhuman. All of them were very real. While the plot wasn't suspenseful, it was gripping and had me flipping the pages without hesitation. 

The only thing I found doubtful was Craig's miraculous recovery. Maybe with some that may be the case, but not many. It would have been difficult if they book ended any other way however, so I'm not too upset about it. 

It's Kind of a Funny Story was a truthful and funny story about depression I won't soon forget."

It's Kind of a Funny Story is about this guy, Craig. Craig took a really intense test to get into an over the top school.

As a result, he has a break down that puts him in a mental hospital. There he gets the friends that he wishes he had outside in the real world. 
I read this book based on my friend recommending it to me. At first I was a bit skeptical about where it was going to go, but as I kept reading I came to realize it really is a funny story. The thing I most like about this book is that it's different. It doesn't focus on the usual topics and situations. It gives you a glimpse into something real, an actual part of the author's life. Some of the ways the main character, Craig, reacts to the situations he gets in are odd, but they make perfect sense for his character. Most of the other characters are fun to read about because they represent people you'll most likely never meet in your life. It's a chance to be Craig, meet those people and learn from them like he did."

I wanted to know that Louisa did meet Ritchie (her quadraplegic chat room friend that helped her) or at least mention him in the book as a follow-up. And Nathan was barely mentioned. 

If there's a third book, I hope she does not introduce a story line with over the top drama like Lily's character had filled the book."

To put it simply, this book is brilliant. Any book that can make me cry, yell, gasp in horror, and feel such compassion for its characters is exceptional. Because this story was told, a part of me has been changed forever.

Young Victoria Jones had no voice. Life had been cruel to her, and she had no say in where, or with whom she would live it. For nine years, she led a distrustful, broken, and neglected existence throughout numerous foster homes. That is, until she was brought to the endless rolling San Francisco vineyards and farmhouse belonging to Elizabeth, her new foster mother. Here she was introduced to a fresh beginning, and inadvertently a voice; the language of flowers.

Troubles and heartache seemed to follow Victoria. Sometimes she battled them, oftentimes they overcame her; but an underlying strength burned in her battered heart, fueling her search for peace, belonging, and love.

I plan on re-reading this book-slower, savoring each delicate, heartrending page. The Language of Flowers is a unique bouquet, compiled of Lavender (Mistrust) Heath (Solitude) Fennel (Strength) and Hawthorne (Hope). The beauty and scent of its blossoms will linger with me for quite some time."
566,"After You (Me Before You, #2)",0000000000,Jojo Moyes,Barnes and Noble,4.3,mckait,"This is a story of of needing to learn how to love. That seems unbelievable, doesn't it? Love just happens. We love our family, we love our friends, we love. We love. But, what if we never had a family, or a friend. What if a child were abandoned by her mother, the first person who would love her? What if she spent ten years with no one showing love, no one to turn to, not even a friend? What happens to love then? Victoria knew the answer. She knew what happens when one spends ten years without love. It becomes unattainable, or seems to. It becomes unbelievable, doesn't it? It becomes impossible. Victoria knew that. She also knew that no one would ever love her, and she set out to make it so. The sadness of Victoria and her spare, hollow life is a tangible thing. It is apparent to Renata, the woman who looked at a gaunt and empty young girl, and decided to try to help. She was careful to only help a little, lest she frighten Victoria away. She was circumspect and a little bit kind. She did what no one before, had managed to do. Victoria allowed her to become a friend. What happens in the days that follow are remarkable. The story grows like a vine around circumstance and coincidence. But then, some say, there is no coincidence. Some things are just meant to be. The journey that Victoria takes after meeting Renata, who is my personal hero in this story, is a journey with many twists, many turns, and many obstacles. But most journeys end somewhere, even if it is only at the beginning of a new journey. The back story, where we learn the language of flowers has its own elegance and beauty. I liked this book.

Batman vs. Superman in an actually conceivable battle, makes the 14 year old in me jump for joy while the adult goes ""oh CRAP!""But I just can't stop being creeped out by Frank Miller and his moral universe, which seems to think psychotic vigilantism is actually pretty okay compared to the Evil Namby Pamby Liberals who Don't Mind Letting Psychos Chop Good Citizens To Pieces. Somehow I really, really don't think the 80s crime wave was caused by that, and it gives me a real ugly feeling in the stomach.Still, a complete page-turner, though the art is a bit samey.

568,"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns (The Dark Knight Saga, #1)",156389341X,"Frank Miller, Klaus Janson, Lynn Varley",Barnes and Noble,4.4,LunaGirl-MCReading,"""Maximum Ride the Angel Experiment"" by James Patterson is a very intriguing book. It is a Science Fiction book written especially for teenage kids. The characters in this book are very different from the normal every day humans. Maximum Ride, better known as Max, is the oldest at age fourteen. She is the leader of the six members of her family, or as they refer to themselves, The Flock. Other members are Fang, who is 4 months younger than Max. He is a very mysterious boy. Iggy is the sarcastic member of the flock and is slightly younger than Max and Fang. He is blind due to the experiments done on his eyes when he was young. The Gasman, better known as Gazzy, is eight years old and has farting problems. Iggy and Gazzy are best friends, and are making bombs out of virtually anything they can get their hands on. Angel is the youngest of the flock. She is The Gasman's' six year old blood sister.

These kids are very unique and powerful. Max spends the first 10 years of her life locked in a tiny cage at a place called ""The School"". There she suffers through test after horrid test from the scientists who created her, by adding bird DNA to her own human DNA. While there, she meets five other winged kids, and with the help of a sympathetic scientist, the six of them manage to escape. This fantastic freedom becomes the happiest time in their lives, bonding Max, Fang, Iggy, the Gasman, Nudge and Angel into a family, the only family any of them has ever known.

""Maximum Ride the Angel Experiment"", was a very exciting and entertaining book to read. This book had a new adventure every time I turned the page. I don't think that children should be experimented on in a lab or locked up in dog crates. That is just wrong.  Even though they were not treated well in the lab, at least they have received powers from all of these experiments that can actually help people out in the world. 

I thought that Maximum Ride was way more in depth, captivating, and descriptive than any other book I have read. Once I started reading this book, I felt sorry for these kids, having to be experimented on everyday, not being able to have any control over what was done to them. That is just so sad to even think about. 

James Patterson is an amazing storyteller, by grabbing the readers attention on page one and keeping it through out the entire book. His vivid descriptions put the reader right up in the sky flying next to Max and the gang, feeling the wind flow though their feathers and the emotions tear through their hearts."
569,"The Angel Experiment (Maximum Ride, #1)",0446617792,James Patterson,Barnes and Noble,4.2,avistrat126,"Nick Hornby's ""High Fidelity"" gives incredible insight into the psyche of a worn out, wounded man.  The protagonist, Rob, carries the reader through the novel with a mostly stream of consciousness style that allows for a raw, personal look into his character.  This man is middle-aged, but still childish in some respects, as so many adults are.  And this is what makes his character so believable, so real.  The reader witnesses Rob responding to and recovering from his his girlfriend, Laura's departure.  And although the tone reveals a deeply hurt man, Rob's cynical sense of humor and initial, almost immature reaction towards Laura adds a humorous dimension to the book.  As his break up forces him to recall his ""Top 5"" most painful past failed relationships, his insecurities come into light, rooted as far back as age twelve.  But his recollections of these flings and obsessions are meant as a jab at Laura, a last-ditch, desperate and immature comeback.  This weak and childish attempt is at once slighlty pathetic and largely amusing.  But this is what makes this book so fantastic.  This is a real person we're dealing with.

On top of his break up, Rob also struggles with where his life has brought him.  With his run down record store as his only claim for a career, he's easily pinned as a loser by society.  But his honest and vulnerable state makes him certainly more affable (I wouldn't go so far as to say pitiable) to the reader.  Through the course of the book, the reader will most likely come to establish a relation to Rob, some parallel fom his life to their own.  Or perhaps, from the opposite end, a somewhat better understanding of the male psychology, thanks to superb and realistic character development."

569,"The Angel Experiment (Maximum Ride, #1)",0446617792,James Patterson,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"I had been a fan of the movie adaptation of the same name for quite a while (and I would highly recommend the film along with the book), so when I found a free copy of the novel I was intrigued enough to give it a try. I found that the novel is just as humorous and appealing as the movie, and is filled with witty and insightful observations about relationships from the male perspective.Hornby is clearly a highly gifted writer, but the real strength of ""High Fidelity"" lies in what he is saying, not how he is saying it. The book takes a unique approach to storytelling, basically arranging the narrative with the use of a list of the main character's five most hurtful breakups. Though this would be a little repetitive and dry if the entire book were organized like that, thankfully Hornby moves away from that device before it goes stale. Another reason that this book was a joy to read was that the characters felt real. The main character was not all that nice, and in fact could be downright spiteful at times, but instead of hating him, I found myself drawn more into the story because of his flaws. Readers looking for some kind of adventure or meaningful story should probably find something else to read, but the plot is highly entertaining regardless.This book manages to excel in a genre mostly dominated by female authors/characters, and will provide readers with plenty of laughs.Highly recommended"

570,High Fidelity,1573225517,Nick Hornby,Barnes and Noble,4.5,cookie4,"Want to read a heart filling book with twists and turns that you would never have guessed would happen in a small town? The Guardian has it all: romance, murder, kidnapping, and true love.
 
	Julie Barenson is your average small town woman living and working in a salon in Swansboro, North Carolina with her Great Dane Singer left to her by her late husband Jim with the promise that he would always be watching over her. Julie feels that after 4 years she is ready to start dating again but is stuck between to great guys: Mike Harris the down to earth guy who she has known since she came to the small town and Richard Franklin the handsome engineer who treats her like royalty. She didn&rsquo;t find out until after a few dates that he wasn&rsquo;t the man she first thought he was and decides to end it and give Mike a shot. That is when Richard starts losing his mind and thing change for Julie. When she decides to go out with Richard that really starts the book off because you want to know if she made the right choice by choosing him and you find out she didn&rsquo;t.




	The characters in this story are pretty believable because you always encounter different types of people. For example Mike is the nice guy whom you can depend on and genuinely cares for other people and for their well being. Sometimes you will encounter people like Richard who is fake nice just to get what he wants and then turns out not the nicest person. Julie has as very hard decision to make but she makes the right one but it makes some people angry and puts her life and her dogs&rsquo; life in danger.




	The major theme of this book is making the right decision because that decision can change your whole life. When you read this book you really understand what I mean by making the right decisions and how they can affect your life. 




	Until I picked this book up I never liked reading. Every time I would have to read a book for school I would hate it and wait until the last minute to read it. Reading still is not my favorite thing to do but I am starting to warm up to it slowly thanks to Nicholas Sparks.




	I give this book a thumbs up. Although it never happened to me it is possible that it could happen. This book will give you an inside look on what can happen to anyone if you&rsquo;re not careful with whom you trust. I would recommend this book to anyone."

571,The Guardian,0446696110,Nicholas Sparks,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood is a tale of human existence on the brink and speculative fiction at its best with strong dystopian overtones. Atwood introduces the protagonist Jimmy, a.k.a. Snowman, in a post-apocalyptic world destroyed and taken over by biological contamination. Jimmy lived in a wealthy scientific community isolated from the poor and contaminated population of the Pleeblands. He grows up being the latter end of a generation of geniuses and holds a rather uncaring and sardonic view of life. Jimmy's best friend Crake is a genius and becomes a successful bioengineer and innovator of complex organisms. Upon Crake's location of Oryx, an adolescent object of Jimmy's thoughts, a complex love triangle suddenly precipitates between Jimmy, Oryx, and Crake just as the world falls into disaster. After the catastrophe Snowman struggles to survive in the vicious world after human habitation and tries to reconnect with the past. The climax of the novel is a convergence of Jimmy's two timelines in an epic d&#233;j&#224; vu revelation and suspenseful conclusion.
	In her novel Atwood presents a possible future of the human race according to a modern view of human nature. Her transcendence of science fiction into speculation and contemplation evokes shock and disgust at the path society is on. One branch of that path and hidden theme in the story is the sick and ironic nature of perfection: one can strive for perfection, but the flaws will always be more explosive. Like the engineer of a time bomb, Atwood locks up secrets and understanding to the complex and at times, confusing story; only when the time is right are they revealed to give the reader an overwhelming sense of epiphany. This technique stimulates the reader intellectually by drawing out predictions and hypothesis as to the origins of some of the developments. Atwood's characters are particularly inventive; their personalities are very normal, but seem out of context in a futuristic world. Her utilization of characters as conveyors of theme does not lessen the attachment and fondness for the characters that grows in the reader. Perhaps the most intriguing and amazing aspect of the novel is the possibility of some of the same events playing out in the human world in the near future. Atwood's startling realism in her fiction gives her work life, uniqueness, and awe."

I recently read this for my Classics Book Club and we all took turns reading various passages from our varying translations of the book, which is something we tend to do each month.  My only complaint about the story is this: the Morley translation (of the B&N Classics version) was AWFUL!  

All of the beautiful, poetic passages that the others in my group read aloud were translated as drivel in my copy (the only one with the B&N version of this book in our group).  It seemed as if Mr. Morley literally translated the French to English (such as ""the horse brown"" instead of ""the brown horse"") and thus, lost much of the wonderful wordsmithing of Voltaire.  I almost cried when it was my turn to read the opening passage because I knew the B&N version was horrible!

However, the reason for that may just be that this is a very poor translation. The language is more archaic than in the original, and many subtleties are lost through poor word choice (for example, in this version Martin ""hopes"" that all is for the best, while in the original he pessimistically ""wishes"" that everything was indeed AT ITS BEST). Nevertheless, Candide is a witty and brilliant story that can be enjoyed for philosophical enlightenment or simply for a rainy day. I would recommend, though, that if you're going to read it in English, get a different edition. Normally B&N Classics are nice, quality editions, but this is sadly an exception."

The story is about a family ¿the Tucks¿ who drink from a magic spring, and become immortal. The Tuck family meets a little girl named Winnie Foster who comes upon their secret. So they take Winnie, and told her what happens when you drink from the magic spring. During all of this, a mysterious man tries to steal the magic spring water, and sell it for a profit. If you want to find out any more, I guess you¿ll have to read the book for yourself.	I thought this book was very unique. Natalie Babbitt uses very descriptive words. When you read this book you will feel like you are right there with the Tucks. When the book describes Winnie Foster it will remind you of when you were a child, always running around and exploring. I believe the message to this story is ¿Be careful what you wish for¿. That is the theme of the story because some people in the real world ask for things they wish they had, but they  never know how bad it could be if they did get what they want. This is a good but unique book.	 If you like books really unique story lines, and good endings this is a book for you. Tuck Everlasting makes you think about life. What would you do if you could live forever? Would you think it is a good thing, or would you think that it is horrible that you could never die? What do you live for if you can live forever?

579,Are You My Mother?,0001713221,P.D. Eastman,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"Published in 1950 and revised 16 times up until 1995 to keep up with the changing art, Gombrich¿s book gives a great introduction to art from the beginning of time up to experimental art of the twentieth century. I started reading the book near its middle at the Renaissance period in Italy.  The book  is full of so much useful information and wonderful pictures. This book really does tell a story; it is not like most textbooks in that each new chapter is separate from the others. Each chapter seems to pick up from the other, showing the true flow of art movements throughout time. The art movements did not just stop and a new one started, instead styles slowly changed and new genres of art formed. The Story of Art is not fragmented and unrelated. It is a real, flowing story. That  is one reason why I enjoyed reading it.   	Gombrich divided his book into 28 chapters. So far I have only read from chapter 13 until the end. The chapters generally start off with examples of architecture and then move on to painting. The section I read starts off with the Renaissance in Italy during the fifteenth century. It goes on to talk about the spread of the Renaissance into Northern Europe. Chapter 15 is about Tuscany and Rome in the early 16th century, with focus on the great artists like Michelangelo, Donatello, Raphael, and Leonardo da Vinci. The next chapter discusses the art style of Venice in the early 16th century, emphasizing artists Titian and Correggio. In chapter 17 we learn how the art  of Italy spread north to Germany and the Netherlands. This chapter talks about German artist Dürer. Chapter 18 is titled A Crisis of Art. It talks about the problem that arose in European Art of new generations not being able to surpass the masters that had preceded them. They were questioning whether art had come to a standstill or if there were still improvements to be made. The chapter also introduces El Greco. The next chapter introduces Baroque art and talks about the transition from Renaissance to Baroque. It highlights artists like Caravaggio, Peter Paul Rubens, and Velázquez. Next is about Holland in the 17th century and Rembrandt. Chapter 21 and 22 go together. They are called Power and Glory: 1 and 2. The first section is about the use of art in churches, the second part is about art to show power and royalty. Chapter 23 The Age of Reason  included St. Paul¿s Cathedral and the focus of art switching from power to ordinary people. In the next chapter questions about what styles are right and even what is style arise in England, America, and France. Chapter 25 discusses the changes in architecture and painting in the nineteenth century and interprets the artwork of Manet, Degas, Monet, Rodin, and Whistler. Chapter 26 is about Art Nouveau, or a new art style. It  brought about artists like Cezanne, Seurat, van Gogh, and Gauguin. In Chapter 27 Experimental Art, shows the switch into modern art with architects like Frank Lloyd Wright and Gropius, and painters Picasso, Munch, Chagal, Dali,  and simplistic sculptor Brancusi. The last chapter states that the story of art does not have an end and the past of it is always changing with new discoveries.  	Since the book has many chapters I will only discuss a few of them in depth. Chapters 21 and 22, Power and Glory, parts 1 and 2 both discuss the discovery of the power of art to impress and overwhelm people. In Chapter 21 the emphasis is on the use of art in churches in Italy in the later 17th and 18th centuries. The style of the period was Baroque, a very decorative style. In churches art was used to teach people who could not read about the Bible, and to persuade and convert people. Painters and architects were always trying to outdo prior artists and use  even more detail. Chapter 22 showed how art could be used by people of power to show this power. A great example is that of Louis XVI who used art and splendor in his elaborate palace Versailles to show his power and royalty. Soon after Baroque"

The author's prose truly provides the reader with an entertaining story and allows him/her an easier method of learning the subject than a school semester.

Scarlet is unbelievably amazing and will absorb you completely! The characters (old and new) find a way into your heart, and really make you care about them and their story. Each has a unique personality and role to play, and it's fun to see them start meeting each other and interacting. Normally I get very annoyed when authors continually switch viewpoints, but Meyer does it very smoothly and in such a way that the book is paced perfectly. 

Meyer also does a great job of making the world setting and it's problems realistic. Plague, armies, war, political confusion, treachery, and secrets make the atmosphere compelling. 

But most of all, I love how we're getting more and more details. Everything is tying together, secrets are being revealed, and the explosive confrontation is getting closer. Scarlet was well worth the wait. My only regret is that I have to wait another year for Cress..."

580,The Story of Art,071483355X,E.H. Gombrich,Barnes and Noble,4.7,SilverbookGirl,"If you have not read Cinder you need to go do that. If the words sci-fi Cinderella retelling don't make you want to read it maybe my review will. Either way if you have not read Cinder I am warning you that this review will contain spoilers for Cinder, not for Scarlet just Cinder. 

 

 Scarlet was just as good as Cinder. A lot of the time second books tend to drag and not be nearly as good as the first book. But Scarlet does not fall into that trap. Maybe it is the introduction of a new POV or maybe it is the added cast of characters, but Scarlet manages to stay fresh where others fail. 

 

In case you could not figure it out, Scarlet is a retelling of Little Red Riding Hood. A retelling that will blow your mind with how different it is from the source material. It takes place in the same world as Cinder just in a different country.  Scarlet is just as sassy as Cinder but they are different she is less insecure and even more kick-ass if you can believe it. If you fell in love with Cinder then you will like Scarlet. She is sassy and I swear I want her red hoodie. 

 

There are also some other new characters such as Wolf who is not all he seems, and Thorne who I thought was going to be annoying but I really liked getting to know. And don't fret, there are still some of your favorite characters from Cinder such as Iko, Queen Levana (though if you like her *side eye*) and of course Kai. 

 

 The two stories of Scarlet and Wolf looking for her grandmother and Cinder trying to escape Queen Levana may seem like they would not come together but they fall in place perfectly and are told through alternating chapters interspersed with chapters about Kai. 

Basically if you liked Cinder get ready for even more fun in Scarlet. Also while some questions are answered you will be joined with me in wanting Cress which does not come out till next year."

582,"Rich Dad, Poor Dad",0751532711,Robert T. Kiyosaki,Barnes and Noble,4.6,BookBreather,"I wanted SO badly to love this book. Crescendo, the second book in the series, ended on a note that left me and everybody else hanging on the edge of our seats. There was so much potential for this book, but I had a very difficult time really getting into it. It took me a few hours each to read the first two books in the series, but it took me almost three days to read Silence. For a while, I wasn't sure why. Then I figured it out. 


First of all, all we do throughout this book is basically re-learn all the information we were given in the first book, Hush, Hush. Some of the character's in Nora's life were obviously keeping things from her, but she didn't know what exactly they were hiding. The problem: The readers DO know. Nora spends almost the entire books trying to unravel information and events that we already know. 


Second of all, I was more than halfway through the book and Patch had only come into the picture TWICE. I'm not sure if Becca Fitzpatrick was trying to prove that the books would be good even without Patch, but I found myself looking ahead to figure out when was the next time Patch would come in. Because while he is not the biggest part of this story, he is HOT and us fangirls want to see A LOT of him. 


Now, in the two books preceding this, I never really had that much of a problem with Nora. A lot of people did, but I didn't mind her that much. But in Silence I swear she got even more stupid, self-centered, and whiny. Seriously, most of her thoughts throughout the novel consisted of, ""Omg. My life sucks. I can't remember anything. Wah wah wah."" I mean, I can understand that you'd obviously be upset about losing your memory, but we didn't need to be reminded every thirty seconds. To make matters worse, Nora didn't really think of anyone other than herself. Sure, she helped Scott a few times and worried about her mother. But she snuck out anyway, knowing that if her mother found out she would probably have a heart attack. She was so wrapped up in her own self-pity that she forgot to warn Scott about a few VERY important things. And when she figured out that Vee and her mother were hiding things from her it was all, ""How could they do this to me? Blah blah blah."" Like maybe they didn't care about her or have a very good reason for omitting information. 


Nora reminded me of the girl that when you're watching a scary movie, you're thinking, ""Yeah, that's smart. Go upstairs and hide in a closet where there is absolutely no room for escape."" Despite everything, she continuously made stupid decisions. She claims to love Patch, but she can't obey ANYTHING he freaking tells her to do. He asks her to stay in a house for a little while, and she goes out to assist a guy with a major target over his head. There were several times throughout this novel when I actually said out loud, ""Oh my god. Why are you so dumb!?"" 


Having said all that, Becca Fitzpatrick is very good with a story arc. Her rising and falling of action was very good. 


This book could have been condensed into a few chapters. There was only about one important event that really furthered this story, and I am extremely disappointed. I am really glad that this is not the final book in the series."
582,"Rich Dad, Poor Dad",0751532711,Robert T. Kiyosaki,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Abby97,"When I first read Hush,Hush I fell head over heels in love with Patch from the begining. When I finlly got my hands on Silenece I couldn't put it down. In silence you'll see a much sweeter side of our favorite bad boy. Over all an excellent book. I can't wait for the next book!Patch and Nora Forever!"
582,"Rich Dad, Poor Dad",0751532711,Robert T. Kiyosaki,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Tribute_Books_Reviews,"An angel gets his wings torn off. By choice. And that's only the first couple of pages of Silence, the third book in Becca Fitzpatrick's best selling Hush, Hush series. And we're not just talking about any angel. It's Patch. The ripped abs, tousled hair celestial being beloved by fan girls (and women) everywhere. He sacrifices himself in order to rescue his human girlfriend, Nora, from the diabolical clutches of her Nephilim father, Hank. One problem. While granting her release, Hank erases five months of his daughter's memory - essentially every moment that she ever spent with Patch. That's some serious parental interference when it comes to teenage romance.

As Nora struggles to find her way through the haze of amnesia, she begins seeing flashes of black while experiencing a rush of intense longing. She's also transported into visions of a female archangel caged in a warehouse suffering torture at the hands of Hank. Yet she only knows Hank as the father of her lifelong nemesis, Marcie and now the unexpected new boyfriend of her widowed mother. She doesn't want him in her life, and now she has a reason to suspect he is capable of even greater treachery. If she only knew.

Her best friend, Vee, along with her mother, conspire to keep any reference of Patch out of Nora's life. Yet her innate yearning to connect with her soul mate allows her to find him in her dreams, and in a twist of fate, at the scene of a 7-11 robbery. As they unexpectedly come face-to-face, Nora senses he is someone who means a great deal to her. Patch provides her with the alias, Jev, and tries to fly under her radar until she is launched into a flashback by accidentally touching the wing scars on his back. Patch can't keep his true identity secret for long, no matter how much he longs to protect Nora from the corrupt bargain he made with her father. However, when Hank breaks his word by infiltrating Nora's life, all bets are off.

Key characters make noteworthy appearances. Scott Parnell is on the run from Hank and his Nephilim army. He seeks Nora's help by climbing through her bedroom window in the middle of the night angling an invitation as her date to the upcoming homecoming dance. Detective Basso is the first to discover Nora wandering in a cemetery months after her abduction, although she faints when he approaches her. Marcie Millar is no stranger to making Nora's life a living hell, but while acting as Hank's puppet she attempts to form an alliance with Nora even taking her dress shopping.

But in Silence, the spotlight remains on the deepening relationship of Patch and Nora. For the first time, Patch is solidly committed to making it work with Nora despite the odds. He has made the decision that she is his destiny and he will let nothing stand in the way of their love for each other. He has gone from a boy's passing interest to a man's fully developed attachment to the woman he loves. For Nora's sake, it's about time. Patch has finally realized the full breadth of his feelings for her. Her patience has paid off. While they still don't consummate their relationship by book's end, they come awfully close. While Patch is more than willing, he respects Nora's decision not to complicate her life any further after she undergoes a life-altering transformation propagated by Hank. She's not the same girl she was in Hush, Hush or Crescendo. In Silence, Nora becomes a new being altogether.

Overall, an angel loses his wings finally proving the devotion of h"
583,"Silence (Hush, Hush, #3)",1442426640,Becca Fitzpatrick,Barnes and Noble,3.5,sap8b,"This review contains SPOILERS. 
 
I came away from 'The Magicians' with very mixed feelings.  I'm leery of books that have reviews on the back flap that mention comparisons ro other books as part of their summaries - because this book - its plot, characters, and setting - should stand on its own.  Unfortunately, 'The Magicians' does not.  It is highly derivative of both the Harry Potter books and the Chronicles of Narnia.  To give one example: a fictional  'welters' game is introduced as something that the magicians play at the Brakebills College.  The rules of welters are never clearly illustrated and the magical game appears to have been introduced simply to mock the Quidditch game that was invented in the Harry Potter books.  (When he first learns about welters, the lead character, Quentin, remarks, ""What, no broomsticks?"")  Indeed, I can't think of any part of the book's plot that was advanced because the characters play welters. 

There is one very chilling scene in which Quentin disturbs a spell that one of his teachers is doing as a demonstration and an extra-dimensional creature appears - freezing everyone in the classroom - with a lethal outcome for one of the students.  However, the creature is later explained away in connection with the ordinary world - and its actions in the classroom don't make very much sense in retrospect.

Lastly, despite the fact that uncovering the mystery of Fillory is the principal quest of the book, Quentin doesn't actually arrive in Fillory until page 286 and the conflict is resolved by page 365 - leaving the remaining 40-odd pages to cover 2 years and a throw-away quest to get out of Fillory.  

To be honest, the book reads like it was the first draft of a novel that somehow made it through the publishing process without ever passing an editor's desk.  It breaks - annoyingly so - one of the basic rules of story-telling: show the reader, don't tell the reader.  And the book spends pages telling the reader what Quentin is feeling, e.g. ""Quentin didn't bother with the DVDs, just flipped channels on the huge TV and slugged stright from the bottle until sunlight came bleeding up over the horizon, like more acid blood oozing out of his sick ruptured heart, which felt - not that anyone cared - like a rotten drum of biohazardous waste at the very bottom of a landfill, leaching poison into the groundwater, enough poison to kill an entire suburb full of innocent and unsuspecting children.""

This book is not a fantasy novel - nor does it ""enlarge the boundaries of conventional fantasy writing"" as the dust jacket would breathlessly have you believe.  It is, at best, an incomplete post-modern novel with inexplicably wealthy, navel-gazing characters who can occasionally perform magic and, at worse, it can be construed as a cynical mash-up of others' truly revolutionary fantasy stories."

Such is the case with EVERYTHING IS ILLUMINATED. Now, not everyone is going to warm to this novel, but keep reading: 'Everything is Illuminated' is the story of a young American (also with the name Jonathan Safran Foer, but this is a work of fiction) who travels to Ukraine to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the holocaust. In the process the book tells several stories: the American's trip to the Ukraine, the story of his grandfather and the town history, his Ukrainian translator's personal struggles with family and identity, and his Ukrainian translator's grandfathers experience during the war. These stories are told in different voices, in different chapters interspersed throughout the book. Some of these work better than others, as Foer seems to have a desire to stretch into literary gimmicks that are not always neccesary. But when he gets it right the passages are as moving as anything I have ever read. His variety of voices allows a reflection on certain elements of the story that reinforces their meaning. Writing about love, personal history, death, and living on allows ample opportunity to take on issues that go to the heart of what it means to be human. It also creates the possibility of falling into a bottomless pit of reflection, over-analysis, and huge failure. This book flirts with those pitfalls at times, but never falls in. It creates scenes of incredible trauma, and manages to tell the story in a way that seems real (a significant achievement for a writer born in 1977). I am struggling to even describe the book, which speaks the complexity of the story and the skill in telling it. I am sure that my enjoyment of the book was enhanced by witnessing first hand some of the absurdity of life in Ukraine, but that is only part of the story. This is a riveting book, often spoken of in the same breath as 'Bark of the Dogwood' with its odd cast of characters. A perfect companion to this book, BARK OF THE DOGWOOD, while completely different subject material, is nevertheless as entertaining. Both are great reads all 'round, but EVERYTHING IS ILLUMINATED is like nothing else on the planet."

588,"The Bourne Supremacy (Jason Bourne, #2)",0752863886,Robert Ludlum,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Anonymous,"Well, well Tammara Webber does it again. With a bang this time!

This book is definitely a new favorite of mine. Actually I think they may be a top favorite ever for me now. As embarrassing as it is to say, I had no idea that this was coming out. I happened across it on Barnes & Noble Saturday night and having loved Tammara&rsquo;s Between the Line&rsquo;s series, I purchased it right away. I was in the process of finishing Grounded by Constance Sharper, so I didn&rsquo;t start until later that night, but once I did, I didn&rsquo;t sleep. Like literally, didn&rsquo;t sleep at all, I stayed up until 7am because I couldn&rsquo;t put it down. Every page turn for me was and opening to another moment in the book that if I had gone to sleep I felt I would have missed out on.

I will note that I have found a lot of site with categorization of Young Adult for this book. While a good chunk of the book is suitable for YA, there are scenes in this book that I would consider needing to be &ldquo;pre-screened&rdquo; by parents prior to letting your child read. First, while the synopsis states &ldquo;After two weeks in shock, she wakes up to her new reality: she&rsquo;s single, attending a state university instead of a music conservatory, ignored by her former circle of friends, stalked by her ex&rsquo;s frat brother, and failing a class for the first time in her life.&rdquo;, I really think this needs to pre-face the fact that it&rsquo;s not just stalking, SPOILER it is attempted rape, that is detailed. Now, I wanted to state that as there are a group of my followers that have relayed to me as parents, they would like to see more of a &ldquo;recommendation of content&rdquo;, so yes, there is a graphically detailed attempted rape scene, BUT, please read it if you, as a parent a concerned and keep it to your more mature teens, because the content of the book I think far outweighs the scenes and there is a recovery/closure to it.

With all of that aside, let&rsquo;s get to the goods. HOLY I LOVED THIS BOOK. While I gush in other reviews and use words like ""swoon"" or phrases like ""fell in love with"", those are usually in terms of an extremely fictional character. So, I will say this, Lucas sparked feelings inside me that could be described with the previously mentioned terms but, it was more of a warm flame inside that built to a blaze by the end of the book. Part of why I love Tammara Webber&rsquo;s writing so much is her characters. Most of her books are for the &ldquo;new-adult/college adult/mature-ya&rdquo; segment and she writes the perfect characters for relation to that age group.

Webber brought some gripping subjects to the forefront with this book. While some may say that there was &ldquo;a little too much&rdquo; going on, I think it was freaking beautiful. The book covers friendship, relationships, getting past your first love, rape, societies feelings of rape victims, and so much more. It was an amazing grouping of romance, suspense and mind-blowing writing that I will forever be a fan of Easy and Tammara Webber.

Overall, this book is solid through and through. The combination of romance and real life problems is on point, creating a must read, FOR SURE!"

'I know that reading this 'classic' is good for me because it's a classic, or so I'm told.' This seems to dissuade many readers from approaching works such as David Copperfield. This summer I have read four Dicken's classics, Bleak House, A Tale of Two Cities, Great Expectations and Copperfield. Copperfield will reward any modern reader with its kaleidoscope of Victorian England, rich with humor and memorable characters. Allow yourself to become lost in the memories of this most famous of fictional autobiographers. The language of Dickens is always a pleasure as he wraps his florobundant prose around a cast of character's and scenes that are never boring and often are filled with humor and pathos, and sometimes both at the same time. It's hard to imagine the inward looking authors of the 20th Century Existing without the foundation of the inward novel from characters such as David Copperfield, Pip of Great Expectations and Esther of Bleak House. David's memories are filtered through his own perception and foreknowledge of what occurs in his life after. Dickens use of the first person narrative in telling David's story anchors you to David's reactions to the events of his life and connects you as a reader to similar events or relationships in your own life. Finally, people are always calling Dickens characters caricatures, but as you read about the Micawbers or Uriah Heep, or Dora and think they seem like immutable beings think about the characters in your own life and see how mutable they are, and Dickens caricatures, even 165 years later seem accurate and rooted in reality. Lastly, don't be fightened by the weight of this tome. Once Dickens envelops you in his world and his language, be it in this work or any of his others, you will glide through his works and reach for the next."

I certainly remember reading Dickens in school, but my appreciation for him has grown greater in my later years.  There are probably many who grasp Dickens at the high school level and can enjoy him greatly   however, it is not untill my later years that I have come to really enjoy him.  This novel originally published in magazine form over a duration of time can at first seem long and daunting and yet it seemed in no time that I was able to finish it.  The title character obviously is David Copperfield and it is somewhat a biographical sketch of the author Charles Dickens life.  While the first of the novel can seem almost unbearbly painful with the character's father dying just several months before his birth and his aunt abondening the family immediatly after Copperfields birth, and the loss of his mother at a young age, things do get better. Dickens intorduces us to a cast of characters that are enjoyable and we get to follow along as David Copperfield goes through his own life.  If you enjoyed Dickens in highschool than you are ahead of the game.  If you did not enjoy Dickens in high shcool than give him another chance."

This is truly a classic.  Don't get hung up on the 'old English language' used.  Just chug on through it.  It's well worth it to take a month to read through this novel and get to know David, as well as the rest of the cast of characters that Dickens brings to life throughout each chapter.  A well woven, well told story, that should be read by everyone at least once in his/her lifetime."

Boy, what a mistake I made! Told from the perspective of thirteen-year-old Arnold Spirit, an intelligent, observant, sarcastic Indian born with encephalitis and a love of cartooning, Sherman Alexie takes us along with him as he moves away from a circumscribed, oppressive life on the Spokane reservation towards a more promising future by attending an all-white school thirty miles away. Never one to get bogged down in sentiment or self-pity, Mr. Alexie refuses to present Arnold's friends and family as one-dimensional stereotypes, nor is the world beyond ""rez"" borders portrayed as the Great White Hope. Arnold's family has problems, to be sure: an alcoholic father, an enabling, codependent mother; a near shut-in older sister. But their love for each other is evident through their words and actions. And despite the ostracism and ridicule heaped upon him by former friends and other tribe members, Arnold reacts with biting wit rather than total despair. This has to be one of the best books I've ever read in my life, so I hope everyone gives it a try."

Alexi's book is realistic, and the often-absurd illustrations will draw any reluctant reader in.  Junior's cataloging of his own faults is so in line with how many students seem to see themselves for a time, at least, and his desperate attempts to figure out where he fits in are easy to identify with.
Depending on the reader, the opening chapter will either draw a reader in instantly or repel them. I think in most cases, it will make Junior more appealing. He lays all of his faults out right away, much as the way teens see themselves. And, like teens, it takes quite a long time for Junior to discover his own strengths. However, the strongest aspect of the work is Alexi's delicate balance between tragedy and comedy. The funniest moments are offered levity by reality, and even the most desperately sad pages have a comic that offers a unique perspective. 
If you're someone who believes that teens need to be ""protected"" from the world; you'll hate it.  If you realize that experiences gained from reading are as valuable as those coming to students, it's easy to recommend this one widely."

591,The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian,0316013684,"Sherman Alexie, Ellen Forney",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Hirlau,"About four years, ago I had met a person who is from Russia. We have a common interest in our family's sports. In a conversation one day on good, evil and the temptations that try men's souls; he recommended I read ""The Master and Margarita."" The first two chapters locked me in. The setting of Pontius Pilate in a private conversation with Christ prior to his execution, was a concept never presented to me before. I would like to believe that such an event occurred. I enjoyed the transitioning in time through out the book. Reading Bulgakov's book has only cemented my thoughts that Hell is real and it exists in our minds. I was surprised at the way Bulgakov presented the Devil (the character Woland). Controlled, not ""fire-breathing"", an individual with total confidence in his agenda; collecting souls. What I noticed in most of the encounters was the always present ""option"" presented by Woland through his underlings; to do the right thing or follow the temptation.
   I felt no compassion for Margarita. I feel that Margarita and The Master ended up as they were from the beginning; lost souls.
   My high point of the book was in the final chapters when Levi delivered Woland(The Devil) the order from Christ on Margarita and The Master. Even the Devil must answer to someone. Good does win out over evil.
   This was the first time I ever reviewed a book. I hope you enjoy this book. Thank you for taking the time to read my review."
591,The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian,0316013684,"Sherman Alexie, Ellen Forney",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"My friend recommended this book to me, and what actually made me to buy it was because he considered it his favorite book of all time. I agree with him about that. It is an amazing book. Not only that, I developed an interest in the author's other works. Nevertheless, this is the best book written by Mikhail Bulgakov. It is an absolute masterpiece, a classic accepted in Russia and the rest of the world.

&quot;MASTER AND MARGARITA&quot; is about purges Stalin ordered in the Soviet Union. The curious thing about this book is that the purges are depicted not to have been carried out Stalin's men, but rather by Satan himself, and in the manner of Baron Munchaussen, we get to know of a huge talking cat. Like animal farm, the greater meaning of the book is revealed through the intelligent though bizarre, compelling and humorous story. One is constantly left anticipating what the next page holds. There are so many layers and so many little details that one wonders how the author managed to put them together.

Bulgakov is the Soviet version of Imperial Russia's Dostoevsky, but unlike Dostoyevsky who had a mastery of the mind/soul Bulgakov mastery is in the literature of oppression. I have recommended this book to many friends and family and recommend it to any reader interested in the enigma that is Russia, especially Stalinist Russia. Other interesting stories set in Russia are THE UNION MOUJIK,TARAS BULBA, PUTIN'S RUSSIA, THE LIFE AND DEATH OF LENIN, WAR AND PEACE. Also note that you are sure to find the widest selection of odd and creepy characters in this book ."
591,The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian,0316013684,"Sherman Alexie, Ellen Forney",Barnes and Noble,4.5,SavageBS,"Great classic novel. I wasn't 100% sure that I would like or enjoy reading this at all, I was wrong~ 

Getting used to all the ""three-barreled Russian names"" as other reviewers have stated, is probably the trickiest part of this classic novel! 

The author calls characters by their 1st name, then later refers to the same character by his middle and last name, a little confusing at times! 

This book has two parts, Part 1 is 168 pages, Part 2 is around 140 pages. Part 1 for me was a little boring, with the exception of the chapter ""Black Magic and Its Exposure"". 

Part 2 is where the book really picks up and turns into a real page turner! ""Satan's Great Ball"" is arguably the best chapter in the book! 

This book has several really, really memorable characters- 

Satan, called Woland in the book 

Behemoth a mischievous, gun-happy, fast-talking, chess playing, black cat the size of a hog (a very likeable cat and the best character in the book by far) 

A great classic novel!"
592,The Master and Margarita,0679760806,"Mikhail Bulgakov, Katherine Tiernan O'Connor, Diana Burgin, Ellendea Proffer",Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"It's interesting, in these days of Harry Potter, to read what people think of LeGuin's Earthsea books and in particular 'A Wizard of Earthsea'. I think that people forget that this book was first published in 1968, about 30 years before the US publication of 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's [Philosopher's] Stone'. While, in my opinion, J.K. Rowling is an extremely creative writer, her characters are all fairly simplistic, with virtually one-track minds. Adults in Rowling's magical world are as immature and petty as the children at Hogwarts. Her characters are driven by rather simple, predictable emotions and goals. Characters in Rowling's books continuously repeat the same character flaws and don't seem to learn from them over the course of seven books. Rowling paints with so thick a brush that the reader becomes duped into accepting that a plot twist equates to character development. LeGuin's Ged, on the other hand, does learn. He exists in a world where children act like children and adults act like adults. He grows immensely during this coming of age tale. His character development leads the plot, rather than the other way around, therefore, creating a much richer read, in my opinion, than any of Rowling's beloved books. LeGuin packs so much imagery, action and character development into a book less than 200 pages long. Compare that to the endless chapters in the Harry Potter books where you spend over 200 pages finding out, for example, who's taking who to the Yule Ball, or how many times Harry will serve detention. LeGuin's book is probably written for younger readers who like to think about the meaning of what they are reading, rather than simply follow a story line laid out before them. Don't get me wrong, I have enjoyed J.K. Rowling's books and I greatly appreciate them for what they are...I've bought the last few books the day they were released, just like almsot everybody else. But I absolutely love LeGuin's work and I feel that she has written amongst the finest fantasy writing I have read, to date, and I've been reading fantasy for over 25 years. For people who have enjoyed reading Harry Potter, you may also enjoy the original three books of this series 'A Wizard of Earthsea, The Tombs of Atuan, and The Farthest Shore'. The Farthest Shore is also a masterpiece. As I have grown older, with maturation of my understanding of the way things work in life, my perspective and understanding of that story has evolved and so I consider that book to be a rare literary equivalent to a fine wine whose flavors change as it ages."
592,The Master and Margarita,0679760806,"Mikhail Bulgakov, Katherine Tiernan O'Connor, Diana Burgin, Ellendea Proffer",Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"A Wizard of Earth Sea by Ursula K. Le Guin is an amazing piece of Sci Fi literature and covers many captivating themes such as light vs. dark, arrogance vs. self control, modesty and maturity vs. boasting and growing and of course friendship. The book was published by A Bantam Spectra Book Co. and what a wonderful decision it was for them to publish such a wonderful book.    Ged starts of young and arrogant with little self control. He strives to be the best at everything he does and wants to prove himself better than his humble island. After discovering his magical abilities he shortly starts making poor choices that his arrogance, lack of self control, and immaturity lead on to. He summons up a spirit and a fog that nearly destroy him twice.      Ged starts a new journey on the island of Roke where he is given magical lessons from the best of the best. In his haste to learn all he can he gains knowledge much faster than other students and quickly excels. He meets his friend and enemy on the same day. Vetch the peace maker a character most enjoyable for his kind ways and Jasper most despised for having all of the bad traits of Ged yet none of his good qualities that make Ged acceptable. Ged and Jasper become competitors and each thinks they are better than the other. This leads to Ged and Jasper having a competition. Ged must summon a spirit to prove he has greater power then Jasper. In doing so Le Guin shows that when a person creates something out of evil and darkness the product of that creation can only be or used for darkness and evil. This was also true in the case of Ged summoning up a spirit which allowed all of Ged¿s poor qualities to be poored into this dark shadow.    Ged leaves Roke to hunt his darkness and when he comes face to face with it he realizes that it is just all of his own bad qualities. Ursula captures how people think of themselves and how we like to avoid all of our bad habits, but in the story Ged must face his and in doing so he truly becomes powerful and great.    In my true and most honest opinion I find this book to be wonderful and captivating. It will keep a reader engaged page after page and will also spark a reader¿s interest in other books written by Le Guin. This story is definitely up there with Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings. If you have any book to read with a class or for fun I would recommend this book again and again."

As i showed and told everyone what i was reading they gave me mix reviews, Some said it was too much of a guy book and was deemed boring and not worth the time to read. As i read on, i was captivated by the main character, and his struggle of guilt and jealousy of someone whom he called a best friend. I was angry and yet i found myself relating to the character of Gene. I mean if you had a friend who had qualities that you wished you could possessed, wouldn't you be jealous of that friend?  You couldn't stay mad at Gene but you couldn't help but not love Phineas. They were two friends of the opposite side of the spectrum, yet they found a way to be friends. Phineas must have known the jealousy that possessed Gene, and the fault of the accident, yet Phineas, as marvelous as he was, forgave Gene.  But it was not just about friendship going through it's rough and uneasy edges but it was about manhood, these boys going to school and figuring what type of men they will become while a war hung over their heads. These boys had their adventures in school, and when it comes to male friendship, its about who you're having the fun with and the strong bond that is created through fears, and understanding of the world. These boys were all shaped and touched by the essence that was Finny, he was their leader so to speak, and he was the one that they looked to for advice and reaction to the everyday commands of life and school."

This book, through its adept narration and quirky characters, tugs at readers' heartstrings regardless of political views. The plot may not be fresh, but the characters are quirky and the dialogue and narration are crisp. Why Grisham chose first person point of view and present tense is beyond me, but the writing in this book is witty, sarcastic and engaging. Also, unlike most other Grisham novels, The Rainmaker has a protagonist who is somewhat realistic and a cast of characters who could be your next-door neighbors.

596,The Rainmaker,0385339607,John Grisham,Barnes and Noble,4,ConnorB,"Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes is an outstanding novel that engages the reader in ways no other novel has accomplished.  The Story is centered on a Middle aged man named Alonzo Quixano, from the region of La Mancha, who enjoys reading books of chivalry.  He eventually becomes so obsessed with these stories that he reads so many until he puts it upon himself to become a Knight-errant to defeat the wicked and defend the helpless.  He names himself Don Quixote de la Mancha (Sir Thighpiece) and finds himself a nag and names it Rocinante (Hackafore) and swears an oath to Dulcinea del Toboso, a peasant women that he labels as a princess.  He convinces his local Sancho Panza to follow him as a faithful Squire, promising to make him a wealthy governor of an isle.
The book is divided into two separate parts, with Part I being published first and Cervantes later publishing Part II.  In the story many of the characters have read Part I, making the story even more interesting and entertaining.  Throughout the novel the reader follows Don Quixote and Sancho as they go on many adventures throughout Spain, creating mischief as they run around in their fantasy world.  Don Quixote and Sancho go around Spain attacking random citizens for insulting Don Quixote, stealing and committing acts in the name Dulcinea.  For every wrong Don Quixote does he makes an excuse that he was blinded by an enchanter and as Sancho takes the heat for his actions.  Don Quixote has many famous recognizable adventures such as Don Quixote's attack upon the windmills, mistaking them for giants, or when he is tricked and frees a devious galley slave.  Or the time when he sees a herd of sheep moving down the desert, and he mistakes them for an army as he charges and ensures carnage upon the sheep.
I think this was a outstanding book that kept the reader interested all the way through. Cervantes writing style helps enhance the story as it engages the reader with an different writing style.  Personally, I like Part I better than Part II, because throughout Part I Don Quixote is reckless and basically does whatever he wants stating that because he's a knight-errant he can basically do what he wants.  While in the Second Part he becomes wiser not striking out when he becomes angry or insulted; not being as crazy and reckless.  I would recommend this book to anyone even though it is a long book; it is completely worth it as you read about the comical and enchanting tales of Don Quixote de La Mancha."
596,The Rainmaker,0385339607,John Grisham,Barnes and Noble,4,Literary_Escape_Artist,"Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes, (this edition published in 2004) is a literary masterpiece. This is the story of a man driven mad by stories of knights in shining armor and their conquests and codes of ethics. The man in the story is Don Quixote de La Mancha. 

He is an older nobleman with a small manor, a vast collection of books and more time on his hands then is healthy. He spends all of his time locked in his library reading stories of knights, damsels in distress, and heroic battles. As he sits and reads his mind begins to grow feeble and soon he creates a delusion in which he places himself as a central figure and takes upon himself the visage of a valiant knight whose sole duty is to secure the world from evil in all of its forms. 

As story progresses his madness begins to manifest and he falls deeper into his insanity exponentially every time you turn a page. Early on, he makes for himself, a suit of makeshift armor and helm so that he can do battle with the evils that lay in wait for him to slay and earn himself the title of Knight. 

I greatly enjoyed this book. It brought me many, many, laughs and a fair amount of stupid looking grins from my peers when they saw me reading a book this size and laughing hysterically. The downside to this story is it is written in a much older style of language and can be confusing at times. Many passages require you to read and reread them to get the meaning, and having the patients to read foot notes is a must. But, if you're like me and enjoy that kind of thing this book will suck you in and spit you out a much happier person. You will learn of madness and how it can affect the mind of man and the many forms it can take. It is a lesson on how surrounding yourself with a life that you can't stand and a reality that drives you mad, will make it much easier for your mind to slip into a world of its own making to bring some much needed excitement and joy into your life.

In the end I would recommend this book, but with a catch. This is certainly not a book for a casual reader or someone who doesn't share my love of reading, mainly due to its size. It is a very large book and can look imposing to some taking away from the experience. Also once you get into and the language used is not remotely familiar it can kill the mood if you are not reading it because you enjoy that. So all and all, if you love reading and enjoy being made to think about what you read then this is a must have for your shelf. If that doesn't describe you then stay away."

I honestly had problems putting this book down and going to bed at night. Maybe it was something as simple as the writing style of using no page breaks until the end of the chapter. Maybe it is because most sci-fi books bounce between three groups of characters and their individual plots. This title stays rigidly focused on the one protagonist, and so maybe I felt like I got to know Fitz better as a character, and was not so distracted trying to keep multiple plot-lines straight. Whatever the cause, I grew totally immersed in Fitz' story, and joined in the constant hope that there would be something better for him just down the road. Cannot wait to read the second one in the series. Bravo.

Unfortunately, this book is possibly ""epic"" to some, but to me? I was severely disappointed.I started the book one night.  I had to read slow, because this is one of those novels that if you happen to read fast or skim, you'll miss a detail and screw up your mental image of the situation or description at hand.  So, I read slowly.  It was trudging along for the first chapter.  I gave it a chance.Fitz is a bastard child of Prince Chivalry, whom is now abdicated from his throne. Fitz is seen as a mistake to everyone except Burrich, the stable master whom cares for him; Verity, Chivalry's brother, now Prince; and King Shrewd, his grandfather.  Fitz carries along in lessons of assassination with his instructor Chade.  And that's where I stopped.Page 150 and my doubts were clear. This book was not for me. I'm all for action, fast-paced adventure, murder and just exciting stuff.  This is a book that is character-driven and really, a fictional biography of Fitz.  It is told from his old self, recalling on the past.  Told in first-person as well.Sure, I'm fine with description and slow pace for 100 pages.  Maybe even 120.  But after that, I'm not going to waste my time to read a book that I'm not merely excited by.  Granted, this book is interesting! This story is interesting, but it doesn't possess that sort of ... jolt.  I'm sorry, I don't get excited by Fitz FINALLY speaking his mind, I don't get excited by his young romance changing her ways to be more girly, I don't get excited when Fitz crawls into bed for three days, full of depression because he feels a ton has been placed upon his shoulders.  I'm not a character kind of guy.I guess that's why you may say I don't particularly enjoy this book or this kind of book for that matter.  I stopped reading it early and granted, I may be wrong. It may pick up later on, but judging from other people's opinions or views who have read the trilogy...it doesn't seem that way.  I may pick up the book again, may even like it if my need for characterization increases in the future, but right now, I want action. Pick up the book if you want detail upon detail, slow-paced storytelling and characterization.  Ignore it if you're like me; you want action and fast-paced events that throw you to the wall in shock and excitement.Before I finish up here, I'd like to give kudos to Robin Hobb.  She has done a tremendous job here and there is nothing wrong with her style. I just happen to dislike the slow-paced trudging through the story."

I don't even know why I liked it as much as I did (perhaps even more than Hitchhiker's Guide).  I will tell you that I snorted, giggled, chortled, laughed and cried my way through it. 

Thank goodness these are short books though - seriously.  The weird factor in them gets a tad overwhelming at times and I have to put the book down and go do something else before my mind explodes.  

And I swear I will never look at a steak the same way again.

I think, by far, my favorite character is Marvin.  There is a scene in this novel where he faces off against a more powerful robot and it had me laughing so hard (in Starbucks of all places!) that I had tears rolling down my cheeks.  For some reason the image, the voices - everything came to life in my imagination during that one scene and it was almost too much to handle.  And yes, I do have a strange sense of humor.

Really fun book and I'm looking forward to the next.. but first I think I'll take a little break.  Too much Adams and I'm afraid I'll spend the next week speaking to my table to see if I get a reaction from it."

598,"Assassin's Apprentice (Farseer Trilogy, #1)",0006480098,Robin Hobb,Barnes and Noble,4.4,NathanTheGreythan,"When i first read Hitchhikers Guide, i only read it because i wanted to see how the book compared to the excellent movie, i am not typically into most fantasy/science fiction books or movies, but Hitchikers Guide was captivating. Douglas Adams writes in such an entertaining way that anyone could find his books entertaining. The 2nd books starts right where the 1st left off, Arthur, Ford, Trllian, and Zaphod Beeblebrox, the president of the universe who had stolen the very ship that they were in and was surrounded by Vogons. Throughout their journey they are shrunken, tortured(well kind of, Zapod walked into a Total Perspecive Vertex, a device that shows you how infinatly small you are compared to the universe), nearly driven into a star, and much more.
I really enjoy the way douglas adams writes and am very eager to read the rest of these books."

599,"The Restaurant at the End of the Universe (Hitchhiker's Guide, #2)",0345418921,Douglas Adams,Barnes and Noble,4.4,PugMonkey,"I was very dissapointed in this second installment. I felt as other ratings have mentioned that Luce's character changed too much from the first book and was cheapened. I can't understand either that Luce had no patience waiting for Daniel and had to be getting into something every 5 minutes, she was down right mean to him. I felt while reading Fallen that Luce's character was portrayed as a old teen, much more mature and grown up, while Torment took years off of Luce's age to give me more of a tween feel for her. Very immature and some what annoying to read about. Don't get me wrong though I will be holding my breath for Passion, but I just beg the author for Luce to come back around to her original self."
599,"The Restaurant at the End of the Universe (Hitchhiker's Guide, #2)",0345418921,Douglas Adams,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"I very much like the first book, Fallen. Torment, left me very disappointed esp. with Luce. Luce's character became very immature, self-absorbed and most of all impatient. She can't even stay put for a very short time (I MEAN A VERY SHORT TIME) while Daniel has to wait every 17 years to meet her!!!!! Fallen described L & D relationship as something almost sacred but I feel in Torment, Luce kind of cheapen those feelings. I feel all she does is doubt everything.... what happen to having ""faith"" with someone you love. She seems to trust her new friends who she only knew a couple of days/weeks over someone she claimed she loved in all her reincarnated lives. I don't know what Daniel is still hiding but I sensed that all he intended is too keep her safe, plus the-too-much-knowledge-will-kill-her business. Don't even start me with her feelings with Miles! At this point, maybe Daniel should have chosen someone who's a little more worthy after he'd sacrificed so much. I will read Passion and see if that can fix the betrayed feeling I got from Luce in Torment."

600,"Torment (Fallen, #2)",0385739141,Lauren Kate,Barnes and Noble,4.2,alp81,"I remember reading this book as a little girl and now I read it to my little girl.  While reading this book usually results in my daughter rambling on for hours at a time, days on end, about her concern for little Peter Rabit it's clear that she loves this story and she regularly asks for me to reread it.  The pictures are beautiful and the story has a good, if somewhat stong, lesson in it.  It is a true children's classic and always will be."
600,"Torment (Fallen, #2)",0385739141,Lauren Kate,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,I love Peter Rabbit and so do my kids.  The narrator is not boring and the flow of the book is good.
601,The Tale of Peter Rabbit,0723247706,Beatrix Potter,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,The Silver Chair has proved to be my favorite Narnia book so far. I can keep good pace with it and understand every word. I've never absorbed myself that much in a book. I finished it and looked up wondering where I was. I can't wait to read The Last Battle.
601,The Tale of Peter Rabbit,0723247706,Beatrix Potter,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"The Silver Chair    This story was about a girl named Jill and a boy named Eustace. Jill and Eustace go out to find the lost Prince of Narnia (which name is Rilian.) On the way they met a Marsh-Wiggle named Puddleglum and Puddleglum joined them. They had to go to the Ruined City of the Giants. They traveled threw a lot of snow to get to the Ruined City. Then they met the gentle giants that were planning to eat them. So they ran away from them. Puddleglum, Eustace and Jill went underground of the ruined city and found Prince Rilian.    	After the evil Queen died the underground world and the overland were in peace. Because the evil Queen was ruler but the men of the underground were scared to disobey her. Prince Rilian is now ruler of Narnia.  	They had to persevere to get past the rough things. If they quit Aslan would surely abandon them from Narnia. So everything would be under the witches control and no one would be happy.  	This book was fun and adventures. Having to travel and hide underground looking for Rilian. I think this was a marvelous idea for a book"
601,The Tale of Peter Rabbit,0723247706,Beatrix Potter,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"I loved it. Once again Aslan is in need for help from another world. Eustace and Jill enter into the un-chartered parts of Narnia to find and save the son of King Caspian, Prince Rilian. Guided by a marsh-wiggle they travel through the land of adventure.Only to discover the remains of what seems to be the white witch who has captured the prince with false love and now has a spell on him. The book has everything from good guys and bad guys to twist and turns. So if you like these things read the book."
602,"The Silver Chair (Chronicles of Narnia, #4)",0064405044,"C.S. Lewis, Pauline Baynes",Barnes and Noble,4.6,ir0nli0nzi0nzbee,"I have read hundreds and hundreds of books over the years. I can honestly say, that the Mistborn trilogy stands out as one of the best series I have read. The conclusion of this trilogy literally left me with goose bumps. As Vin, Sazed, Elend, and company fight a war that seems all but over, the thrilling triumph at the end was amazingly original and powerful. I would highly recommend this series to anyone who is a fan of Science-Fiction/ Fantasy. I eagerly await more stories for the world of the Mistborn. The setting, plot, and magic system in this series are all original and well thought out and could very well be the base for a spin-off role-playing game of it's own. I give this series, and especially it's conclusion a definite 5-stars. With his Mistborn series, Sanderson joins the ranks of George R. R. Martin, Terry Brooks, Raymond Feist, and other great Fantasy authors. A definite must read!"
602,"The Silver Chair (Chronicles of Narnia, #4)",0064405044,"C.S. Lewis, Pauline Baynes",Barnes and Noble,4.6,BassmanSeidell,The title says it all. Mr. Sanderson had my jaw on the floor with this ending. He closed many of the questions I had asked in the first few books and was nice enough to hint at new ones. This is the first book series that ever left me in joy/sadness tears at the end
602,"The Silver Chair (Chronicles of Narnia, #4)",0064405044,"C.S. Lewis, Pauline Baynes",Barnes and Noble,4.6,Jubo,"A fantastic, original story that delivers in every way.  The thing I love about Sanderson's writing is that the worlds he creates (this series and Elantris) are solid and believable.  His characters are rich and complex.  At the first couple of references to Kelsier in this book, I was surprised to find myself getting misty (I haven't had a character do that to me since Druss the Legend, lol).There are a couple of chapters mid-book that are kind of slow; I think this is a common pitfall that many authors fall into (those who write series), in that they have to ""catch up"" the new readers to the series with background information that isn't always included in the synopsis.There were book summaries for both one and two, but they were located in the back of the book rather than in the front.  Odd.  The book, overall, was a joy to read.  Beautifully written, it had everything that one looks for when reading this, or any genre."
603,"The Hero of Ages (Mistborn, #3)",0765316897,Brandon Sanderson,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Awesomeness1,"I enjoyed the book even if I'm not all that sure about the message. 

This book was the true story of Susanna Kaysen who was committed to a mental hospital when she was 18. The chapters were short and crisp, and could most likely be read as short stories in themselves. The book was also interspersed with official forms documenting Kaysen's two year stay at McLean, which Kaysen only got the rights to many years after with the help of a lawyer. Kaysen kept her writing humorous and curt as she talked about the various patients, doctors, and incidents at the hospital. I liked these chapters, but got bored later on in the book after she left the hospital and began to describe the bounds of her illness. I'm a teenager myself, and my attention span is short. 

I enjoyed the book for its quirkiness and memorable characters, where others might like it for its comments on mental illness and the treatment of the mentally ill in the 60's."
603,"The Hero of Ages (Mistborn, #3)",0765316897,Brandon Sanderson,Barnes and Noble,4.2,EGorski,"I read the previous reviews and yet forgot that the story was not written in a linear fashion. That minor shock aside ""Girl, Interrupted"" was an unexpected treasure. I found Susanna Kaysen's story hit home in a very quiet manner. While reading her story the emotional weight of the individual glimpses into her life, as well as her overall life experience didn't hit me until after I had put the book down. It was an interesting view into a disorder that many live with everyday. 

If you are looking for the book version of the popular movie ""Girl, Interrupted"" this really isn't the book for you. While many of the stories from the book are also in the movie; there are many situations that take place in the movie that were never in the book. However, if you want a provocative and compelling look into the life of someone with BPD then I highly recommend this book."
603,"The Hero of Ages (Mistborn, #3)",0765316897,Brandon Sanderson,Barnes and Noble,4.2,middleschoolbookworm,"i could not put this book down. it put me into the mind of susanna kaysen and didnt put me back into the real world until i was done. she seems so normal so  sane, she asks the same questions we all ask at some point in our lives but never say outloud, she thinks the same thing we do. she becomes a symbol of each and every human being. And this book made me ask the question: are we all insane? are we all just like susanna kaysen?"
604,"Girl, Interrupted",0679746048,Susanna Kaysen,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"By far, one of the funniest books I've read recently.  From the hilarious story of her getting arrested for a DUI and ending up in LA County for an unrelated false id theft to going to Costa Rica with her father on a ""honeymoon"" to get first class airplane seating, Handler is absolutely unique, raunchy, and hilarious.  Whether she's discussing her close friends, ex boyfriends, or family, Chelsea doesn't hold back and tells it how it is. If you love Chelsea Lately, you will love this book! If you're easily offended by sex talk and dirty jokes; step away now."
604,"Girl, Interrupted",0679746048,Susanna Kaysen,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Nikky_S,"Having seen Chelsea doing stand up and on Girls Behaving Badly, I was anxious to see how her wicked sarcastic wit would translate into text. It's fantastic! A seriously gifted writer, who combines funny and uninhibited raunchiness better than any woman.  And it's not just the sheer ridiculous circumstances she encounters. She reflects about her mindless journeys and the meaning of life in such an amusing, self-deprecating and cynical manner.  

Filled with funny anecdotes, she has that trashy comedienne's gift of saying everything we think about but are afraid to say. And she manages to share absolutely horrifying events and somehow make them hysterical!

There are some hilarious and uncomfortable family situations. Her father was quite the provider of wisdom, selling used junkyard cars out of their front yard, while making inappropriate sexual innuendos towards his daughters. 

There's some really funny and humiliating youth debacles and misadventures. My favorites; her embarrassing and preposterous fake celebrity elementary school tale, a LOL birthday party for a friendless girl full of re-gifting, pretending to be honeymooning with her father in order to upgrade to first class. The Mini-Me and Prison Break chapters are just classics. Frankly if she wasn't successful, she may have ended up a basket case. 

At some points in a story, I laughed so hard, my husband kept trying to steal the book from me.  I didn't want the book to end. Everyone can find something to relate to in one of these stories. 

If you are sensitive or quick to take offense, I would pass on this one. If you have a repressed wild side, you'll dive in headfirst and relish her antics and live vicariously through them. Also, if you like reading funny out of control drinking and sex stories, I'm half-way through Chelsea's other book  My Horizontal Life: A Collection of One-Night Stands and it's great. 

And although I can't admit it to my husband, I secretly loved the book that is guy's version of the same theme. Steamy sex, hilarious, and like a James Bond story. 

High Heels and Dirty Deals - Globetrotting Tales of Debauchery from a Binge-drinking Nymphomaniac by Brett Tate. Get all three!"
604,"Girl, Interrupted",0679746048,Susanna Kaysen,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"Definitely a book I'd describe as 'outrageously funny', mostly because half the stuff this woman says is the kind of things you'll either find hilarious in a 'that's so wrong' kind of way, or you'll be offended and refuse to read on further. Still, I'll be looking into her other books since I enjoyed this one so much."

Since then, I have been on an everlasting journey, discovering more everyday.  Each day brings me to a new plateau of understanding. After my father died, I grieved and continue to this day. But, I remember this book, and I know that my father is simply soaring to greater heights."
605,"Are You There, Vodka? It's Me, Chelsea",0061173398,Chelsea Handler,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,I read this book as a young girl and when my son was in 3rd grade I read it to him. He loved the book. Now he is 12 and he picked this book to buy for the Chritmas Tree gift to give to a 12 year old boy. It is a book enjoyed by all ages even adults. You don't find many books like this. Highly recommended for everyone!!!
605,"Are You There, Vodka? It's Me, Chelsea",0061173398,Chelsea Handler,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"Jonathan Livingston Seagull is an inspirational story about a seagull that has a passion to learn to fly. Jonathan never worried about what the others thought of him. He became an outcast and was banned from the flock, but he still didn¿t stop believing. He never pushed through all limits. He made the impossible possible. He was determined to reach every goal, and succeeded. Jonathan was hungry for perfection. Perfection isn¿t impossible if you put your mind to it. This simple creature became perfect. He learned to take control of his own mind instead of letting his mind control him, instead of letting the others tell him that the average speed of a seagull is whatever, he refused to believe he could be like the rest. He had to be better than the rest. He had to be the best, fastest, highest flying seagull God had ever created. There are many themes that the book has. One theme is to not let others worry about you. Another theme is if you could put your mind to it, you could achieve anything. If you don¿t stop believing, anything is possible. Don¿t be limited by anything. If there is a plateau blocking your path, push through it.  If you read this book more than once, you will find a different theme each time. This book can especially inspire you if you are in sports, or if you are just trying to reach a personal goal. This book also shows the outlook on life in the 1960¿s and 1970¿s. It contains references to life, religion, and freedom. Jonathan believed every bird should be free and have a right to life and freedom. This book was great. I would recommend this book to all ages, but it could be understood easier by teenagers and young adults."

606,Jonathan Livingston Seagull,0743278909,"Richard Bach, Russell Munson",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"When I was a child, young and disenchanted with the world, my father told me to read this book.  Since then, I have been on an everlasting journey, discovering more everyday.  Each day brings me to a new plateau of understanding. After my father died, I grieved and continue to this day. But, I remember this book, and I know that my father is simply soaring to greater heights."
606,Jonathan Livingston Seagull,0743278909,"Richard Bach, Russell Munson",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,I read this book as a young girl and when my son was in 3rd grade I read it to him. He loved the book. Now he is 12 and he picked this book to buy for the Chritmas Tree gift to give to a 12 year old boy. It is a book enjoyed by all ages even adults. You don't find many books like this. Highly recommended for everyone!!!
606,Jonathan Livingston Seagull,0743278909,"Richard Bach, Russell Munson",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"Jonathan Livingston Seagull is an inspirational story about a seagull that has a passion to learn to fly. Jonathan never worried about what the others thought of him. He became an outcast and was banned from the flock, but he still didn¿t stop believing. He never pushed through all limits. He made the impossible possible. He was determined to reach every goal, and succeeded. Jonathan was hungry for perfection. Perfection isn¿t impossible if you put your mind to it. This simple creature became perfect. He learned to take control of his own mind instead of letting his mind control him, instead of letting the others tell him that the average speed of a seagull is whatever, he refused to believe he could be like the rest. He had to be better than the rest. He had to be the best, fastest, highest flying seagull God had ever created. There are many themes that the book has. One theme is to not let others worry about you. Another theme is if you could put your mind to it, you could achieve anything. If you don¿t stop believing, anything is possible. Don¿t be limited by anything. If there is a plateau blocking your path, push through it.  If you read this book more than once, you will find a different theme each time. This book can especially inspire you if you are in sports, or if you are just trying to reach a personal goal. This book also shows the outlook on life in the 1960¿s and 1970¿s. It contains references to life, religion, and freedom. Jonathan believed every bird should be free and have a right to life and freedom. This book was great. I would recommend this book to all ages, but it could be understood easier by teenagers and young adults."

Though don't think this is the end of what you will be reading by cassandra clare.
She is writing a new shadowhunter series called the dark artifices which takes place after city of heavenly fire in LA, SO IT SHOULD BE PRETTY GOOD! anyways, they are making the city of ashes movie already so don't worry the shadowhunter world isn't over yet."
607,"City of Heavenly Fire (The Mortal Instruments, #6)",1481426303,Cassandra Clare,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"Wow

This whole series has touched many, many people which makes it very hard to say goodbye to characters we have stood by for 6 books.

Isabelle has taught us to be strong despite what others tell you. Whether it was too young or too weak she would never listen and stay strong and tall.

Alec has taught us to be brave in who you are and stand strong, even if it means standing alone. He holds his own and holds others as all hell breaks loose.

Simon has taught us to never give up no matter what life has in store for you, which for him it has been A LOT. Everytime he was told 'no' or 'I'm going to kill you' he fiercely stayed by his best friend.

Magnus has taught us wisdom is a powerful gift and creativeness. He has showed us how despite his appearence as a teenager and carefree nature he can be very smart and deceptive to get what he wants, something everyone should have a little of.

Jace has taught us to define yourself. Despite being told of who he really is, Jace broke free and made his own destiny and life.

Clary has taught us many things. Love, true self, happiness, but one thing that has been underappreciated is she taught us that anyone could be powerful, even seemingly normal girls from New York. She let us know the truth is scary but it's possible to overcome then fear by being strong.

This world, these characters started off as an idea, and now they have changed real people and their depiction on their lifes. This finale was the perfect ending to this fantasy and left myself filled with joy that I stayed with these people up until the end. I encourage everyone to finnish the journey and I thank Cassandra Clare for helping not only me but others through life with these people. They are as close as family

Thank you"
607,"City of Heavenly Fire (The Mortal Instruments, #6)",1481426303,Cassandra Clare,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Tween_2_Teen_Book_Reviews,"In writing this review, I'm going to assume that you've read the previous books in The Mortal Instruments as well as The Infernal Devices.

You have no idea how much I loved this book (unless you read it/watched me read it). After Clockwork Princess, I was really worried I'd be sobbing at the end, but surprisingly, I was not. I got the book the week I was volunteering at a local elementary school, so I didn't exactly get much reading time. Which means, I got it Tuesday evening and finished it Thursday evening. And by Thursday evening, I mean really early Friday morning. So what if I stayed up past midnight to finish it, right? RIGHT? As I told me parents when I was explaining myself, it was SO worth it! There is a good possibility that part of this review will be be whited out for spoilers, so prepare yourselves.

There are SO many characters in this book! Along with the main cast from the previous books, Emma and Julian from the next series get bigger roles, as well as Brother Zachariah. I love all the characters for different reasons. Clary is simply amazing. She's talented and isn't afraid to stand up for what she believes in and bend the rules when need be. Jace does just bend the rules, he breaks them, repeatedly. Over and over again. In the words of Clary &quot;Yeah, but he's hot.&quot; (Also, can anyone tell me what the E is in the DSES scene? I couldn't figure it out) Magnus is sparkly and amazing. Up to this point, we've never seen him falter, so it's interesting to see him at his lowest points. Alec is a wonderful combination of careful and fearless, leading to some interesting messes. Izzy is plain fun, but she also has a real self under the facade. Izzy charges into a fight, but when it comes to matters of the heart, she's more than cautious. Simon, while not necessarily charging into a fight, takes the heart head on. He isn't afraid to tell Izzy how he feels about her, and that's something that I admire in him. Also, his nerd references are BEAUTIFUL! I really loved getting to meet Emma in this book, and am excited to get to know her better next year in The Dark Artifices book one, Lady Midnight.

This book was a beautiful 725 pages! It's easily the biggest book on my shelf! I love that it was very large and kept me entertained all the way through. I wasn't as interested in the Maia parts as the others, but it was interesting at times. I loved seeing Tessa and Jem in the book (though Jem is never referred to by name). I love how Jem still feels the need to fight for the Shadowhunters, and protects Emma (cause, you know, they're kinda related). I love when Jem will reference events from TID, and while no one else in the book gets it, it sends me into fits of tears or laughter, the two are practically interchangeable at this point, especially when concerning Cassandra Clare. There is no doubt in my mind that I loved this book, and I can't wait for Lady Midnight to release next year! Five stars for sure!"
608,Love You Forever,0920668372,"Robert Munsch, Sheila McGraw",Barnes and Noble,4.4,happyhousewife2007,"I love this book. I was too old for it when it was first published, but I remember my mother reading it to my baby sister. It's a sweet story and now that I have children I understand it more. The people who claim it is creepy obviously missed the point and I pity them for their lack of insight. It is meant to be a SYMBOLIC journey of a mother's love for her child. No matter how old your child gets or what they accomplish in life, they are always your ""baby"". My daughter is two now and I sometimes wish I could rock her as an infant again for just a few minutes. I'll probably have the same feeling when she is twelve, twenty, or sixty-two. This book illustrates that longing in a way that is both heartfelt and whimsical."
608,Love You Forever,0920668372,"Robert Munsch, Sheila McGraw",Barnes and Noble,4.4,True-Enthusiast,"My first generation immigrant husband used to love to read this to our three little girls (even though the story was admittedly a bit unconventional). As the girls grew older and on our many trips ""home"" visiting Greece, my mother-in-law practiced her English by listening in at story time. I noticed that as her understanding of English improved over the years, her eyes would well up every so slightly toward the end of the book. It was very clear to all of us that the story was one of enduring and unconditional love, couched in terms that any child (or adult for that matter) could understand - being rocked in the arms of the person who loves you most. When my Mother-in-law took ill in her early 80's and her plump grandmotherly figure wasted away to an almost childlike form, my husband often literally carried her into bed at night. He would then sit by her side and read ""Love You Forever"" as he tucked her in. Now it was his eyes welling up as she drifted off to sleep with the contented look of a someone who feels well taken care-of and a small smile of gratitude.  Now that she has passed, I am keeping the book so that we can read it to our grandchildren and hope to find the same solace that both my children and their grandmother found in this wonderful story..."
608,Love You Forever,0920668372,"Robert Munsch, Sheila McGraw",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"I am as cynical at they come, but come on people.  For all of you who called this story perverted or creepy, perhaps you should look past the physical image on the page and look at the symbolism of this mother-child journey. I highly doubt the author is recommending driving across town with a ladder strapped to your car, but rather loving and supporting your child no matter how far they live from you(physically or idealistically) or how much of a sacrifice you would have to make to do so. I highly doubt that any Very Hungry Caterpillar could chew through 7 apples in one day like the pictures illustrate, but I don't see anybody up in arms about that..."
609,Cell,1416524517,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,3.9,TeensReadToo,"First off, I've never been so glad that I don't own a cell phone! Secondly, Stephen King has penned another gruesome winner, going back to his days of blood and gore. CELL starts off with the Pulse, where everyone who owns a cell phone answers a call and subsequently goes psycho. Back to their basic days of kill or be killed, these are slobbery creatures with no morals, emotions, or human qualities besides the desire to destroy. Enter Clayton Riddell, a man happy to have never given in to the need to purchase a cell phone, who watches the people on the street of Boston go murderous. He hooks up with Tom, another ""normie"" and Alice, who watched her mother go crazy and kill a cab-driver, to escape the city. Clay is heading home to Kent's Pond, Maine, to check on the well-being of his estranged wife, Sharon (who doesn't own a cell phone) and his son Johnny (who does). What follows is the groups trials and trevails as they're inevitably pushed towards Kashwak, the NO-FO zone. You'll have to read CELL to figure out what this means, but believe me, it's well worth your time and effort! Stephen King has returned to his days of blood and gore, guts and more blood, and the result is a winner. If you love horror, or King in particular, you won't go wrong picking up a copy of this latest winner."
609,Cell,1416524517,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Book_Reader_222,"(Originally written February 20, 2006)

I am not the world's biggest Stephen King fan. Nor am I a fan of the zombie genre (what could be less scary than a monster whom you can escape with a fast walk?). So when a friend of my son's insisted that I borrow his copy of ""Cell,"" I was humoring the young man more than anything else. 

Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised. This story is brisk and gripping, and not bogged down with a lot of the overly heavy details to which King is often prone. It is also shorter than many of his opuses, which pleased me. 

But most importantly: This is NOT a zombie novel! Sure, the victims of the Pulse share many of the violent characteristics of zombies, but like the movie ""28 Days Later,"" they are more like RABIES victims than the undead. And that's just the beginning. They quickly begin evolving as a group, making them more and more interesting than ""regular"" zombies with each page. 

I was a HUGE fan of Richard Matheson's ""I Am Legend"" from all those years ago, and was disappointed to see the theme ""devolve"" into the zombies we are familiar with today. So it was nice to see King return the genre to the greater potential it once had with Matheson's vampires. 

My biggest complaint would lie in the ENDING. As other reviewers have commented, the book feels incomplete. With Gary Brandner's ""The Howling,"" I felt that we were missing an epilogue - in ""Cell,"" I felt as though I were missing an entire final chapter, maybe TWO. Is King planning a sequel to ""Cell?"" I hope so; I will read it. As it stands ... 

But again, overall, I was pleasantly surprised by this book, and I would recommend this book to fans of ""I Am Legend,"" ""28 Days Later,"" and (to a lesser degree) the ""Dawn of the Dead"" 2004 remake. If you are a hard core fan of the George A. Romero zombie genre, you probably won't like it."

610,The Boys in the Boat: Nine Americans and Their Epic Quest for Gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics,067002581X,Daniel James Brown,Barnes and Noble,4.4,TheReadingWriter,"If I told you one of the most propulsive reads you will experience this year is the non-fiction story of eight rowers and one coxswain training to attend the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, you may not believe me. But you&rsquo;d need to back up your opinion by reading this book first, and you will thank me for it. Daniel James Brown has done something extraordinary here. We may already know the outcome of that Olympic race, but the pacing is exceptional. Brown juxtaposes descriptions of crew training in Seattle with national races against the IV League in Poughkeepsie; we see developments in a militarizing Germany paired with college competitions in depression-era United States; individual portraits of the &ldquo;boys&rdquo; (now dead) are placed alongside cameos of their coaches; he shares details of the early lives of a single oarsman, Joe Rantz, with details of his wife's parallel experiences.

The 1936 Olympics in Berlin was the stuff of legend, when Jesse Owens swept four gold medals in field and track, but a Washington crew team won that summer also, against great odds. How that victory took place and how a group of great athletes became great competitors is something Daniel James Brown spent five years trying to articulate. Quotes from George Pocock, crafter of cedar shells, head each chapter, sharing his experience watching individual oarsmen become a team."
610,The Boys in the Boat: Nine Americans and Their Epic Quest for Gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics,067002581X,Daniel James Brown,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"As a rower familiar with the '36 Olympics, I was drawn to the book out of a general interest; but I have to say it is exceptionally well written in how it puts together the characters and tells a story well beyond the world of crew.  This book is going to be a best seller.  If you have a chance, pick up a great coffee table book about George Pocock: Ready All Row.  It sheds even more light on this central character and his accomplishments."
610,The Boys in the Boat: Nine Americans and Their Epic Quest for Gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics,067002581X,Daniel James Brown,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"If all stories about rowing were written like Daniel Brown's fabulous multi-level biography, I would read every one of them. This is a wonderful account, told with such detail and precision that I sometimes felt as if I were in this tale. Mr. Brown totally sucked me into his adventure. These young men who rowed for the USA in the 1936 Olympics faced huge obstacles. It was the Depression. Many were dirt-poor. They came from a small (then) and nondescript town of Seattle. They could not have had more difficult problems thrown their way. But by taking every sliver of hope, and mixing in superb craftsmanship (from George Pocock), excellent coaching (Al Ulbrickson), and these nine perfectly attuned young men learning together........the result was perfection. This is a true Team sport. I am not giving away anything by telling you that they DO win Gold at the 1936 Olympics. It is HOW they did it that is so darn exciting. Even knowing the end result does not diminish this bigger than life adventure. This is a must read, period. Many of the old luminaries of American rowing are in this story, the good, the bad, and the legendary, including Hiram Conibear, Tom Bolles, Al Ulbrickson and George Pocock. The story of the Pocock racing shell, which was still the best racing boat in the US when I started rowing, is detailed, along with the life story of George Pocock, his personality, and his contributions to Washington crews. This is an inspirational story, one that will lift you up, and it is wonderful, not only because Brown is a great writer, but because it is true."
611,The Silmarillion (Middle-Earth Universe),0618391118,"J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien, Ted Nasmith",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Major_Kelly,"What can you say about a book that literally creates an entire world starting with God and the Void, the creation of the angels, the dawn of life and ending thousands of years later after covering the foundation stories for nearly all Anglo-German myths? You'd have to say it was the work of the world's premiere literary genius. Then when you read it, you'd find that the language matches the material the way harmony complements melody. This is simply one of the most amazing and beautiful books in English literature. The stories and the poetry will stay with you forever. Its sweep is so enormous, it makes Tolkien's own ""Lord of the Rings"" seem like a campfire story. If you love fantasy, you must read it."
611,The Silmarillion (Middle-Earth Universe),0618391118,"J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien, Ted Nasmith",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"More than just back-story for The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, The Silmarillion stands on its own, with many fantastic and, yes, tragic, stories from the mind of J.R.R. Tolkien.

This has been a favorite of mine for many years, and I recently downloaded the Nook version.  My biggest disappointment with this version is the omission of the map.  It seems to me that the ebook format has much more potential for hyperlinking than what is currently offered.  For example, when a geographical reference is made in the text, hyperlink it to the map!"
611,The Silmarillion (Middle-Earth Universe),0618391118,"J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien, Ted Nasmith",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"I finally finished this book, after picking it up and putting it down a couple times. Thats the trick, if you can make it through the first 50-80 pages then you will really like the book after finishing it. Those first few chapters are a little hard to read because of all the different names and places etc.  But the majority of the book is easy to read and very informative into the background of the LOTR world, before the 3rd Age. It is basically a history of the world Tolkein created for the LOTR series. But there is some action in it, with some great stories of characters more amazing than those of LOTR. It really helped me understand the movies. I plan on reading The Hobbit and then the LOTR series. I recomend this book to anyone who appreciates and enjoys the amazing imagination of JRR Tolkein."

Great action, amazing character development as it introduces interesting characters. Suspenseful story that grips your attention, almost like being gripped in lobster claws."
612,"The Drawing of the Three (The Dark Tower, #2)",0451210859,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Justin Walker,"First off let me state, I am writing this from my Nook. I am not a fan of Stephen King. Many times I have sat down with a popular novel of his only to stop reading midway. However, with the Dark Tower series, I have read the first two novels and am going to purchase the third as soon as this review is written.  The Drawing of The Three, for me, was not quite as engrossing. The addition of the three new characters was a mixed bag. Detta more specifically, had me skipping large chunks of words as her performance was over the top. This made the book drag and I found myself counting how many pages were left every time she spoke. The overall quality of the story shines through despite Detta. There is just enough action to conflict to keep you in suspense, wondering what will come next. Even if you are not generally a Stephen King fan I recommend giving this series a try. You will be glad, like I, that you did."

613,The Forgotten Garden,0330449605,Kate Morton,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Aradanryl,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is an easy read, and yet gave me room to pause as I stopped to think.  I like books that let me do that without pounding me into a pulp on the way. I suspect the book might appeal more to women then men and it would be a good choice of several of the reading circles I know. I appreciated the many issues raised in a gentle and non-judgemental fashion.  Those with unresolved issues involving child abandonment, fostering, adoption, and similar issues might find the book uncomfortable but most likely not overwhelming.  I would have read this book with my daughters, exploring the different facets of love of a child, some that hold tightly, some that let go.I also appreciated that skillful weaving of the generations, a reminder that we impact each other with our choices.  My only regret:  that Eliza's book of fairy tales isn't a real book.Things I like knowing before I buy a book: No profanity that I noticed.  Respectful story-specific reference to sex. Emotional issues dealt with tastefully and healthily.  I wil read more by this author."

Nell grows up and has a nice life but always searching for her original family...Nell dies in her 90's and her granddaughter continues the search for Nell's family....Exciting, mysterious read, in the Victorian era...Lots of drama!..Enthralling page-turner! A beautifully written tale!!!

Just finished reading THE HELP...WoW!  Another must read I'm recommending is EXPLOSION IN PARIS, Beautifully done as well! Definite KEEPERS!"
613,The Forgotten Garden,0330449605,Kate Morton,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Sarah_R,"When I saw that Kate Morton released a second book, I couldn't wait to get my hands and eyes on it. House at Riverton had been a recommend from a fellow bookseller and, wary as I am of recommends, I read it. And I loved it. But The Forgotten Garden I loved even more.

Kate Morton has a knack for weaving the past and the present together, for spanning the continents, and for intricate character and plot details that have that ""blink and you'll miss it"" feel.

I devoured The Forgotten Garden. Cassandra in present-day Australia who, after her grandmother's death, is left a house in Cornwall, England. To Cassandra's grandmother, Nell, both as a child and as an adult, discovering her past. To the mysterious Mountrachet family and fairy tale Authoress Eliza Makepeace. Who is everyone? How are they connected? Who is Nell, really? And what will Cassandra learn about both her grandmother and herself along the way?

What I liked most about Morton's second novel is that it wasn't easy to figure out. The mystery shrouding the characters (each and every character, from a maid in the Mountrachet household, to Nell's parents in Australia, to a young gardener Cassandra meets) folds them all together and doesn't give anything away prematurely. I love figuring things out, but each time I thought I had something figured out, Morton added in another element. You would think with this many strings, the novel would be tangled and heavy, but that isn't the case at all. In fact, everything is necessary and everything comes to fruition.

I'd recommend this to anyone who likes to be surprised, who likes interweaving storylines, past and present, and -- well, really, anyone at all. It is phenomenal."
614,The Trial,0099428644,"Franz Kafka, Edwin Muir, Willa Muir, Max Brod",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"I am a complete Kafka freak. I have read almost every one of his novels, short stories and diaries in many of the available translations and the original language. I must say, that 'The Trial' is the most perfect example of Kafkaesque literature, aside from 'The Metamorphosis'. It can also be noted that it is one of the less complex novels by Kafka."
614,The Trial,0099428644,"Franz Kafka, Edwin Muir, Willa Muir, Max Brod",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"Contrary to the other customers who wrote a review on The Trial, I enjoyed the novel thoroughly. I found many parallels to Camus's The Stranger and was shaken by its prophecies towards the downfall of Marxism and Communism. I admit it is easy to get lost in Kafka's convuluted style, but one most look deeper into this novel and extract an important theme. This theme is existensialism and is first explored in this novel. Finally, the book is a comment on our judiciary and governmental bureaucracies that exist today."
614,The Trial,0099428644,"Franz Kafka, Edwin Muir, Willa Muir, Max Brod",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"Kafka¿s unfinished novel, blended with surrealism and a disturbing apathetic world, makes us realize that we ourselves, all our lives, are incomplete, absurdly alive in a world that haunts us with death, anxiety and the hostility of society at every turn...making us realize that our plight is hopeless so long as we cherish the cherries of the common.  	This is a book for all who know the worst of life and man, who know what it means to be unique, and above all, alone in a world that simply does not care."
615,This Lullaby,0142501557,Sarah Dessen,Barnes and Noble,4.6,dragonflyDD,"The book This Lullaby by Sarah Dessen is a heartfelt story about a young adult known as Remy.  Remy has always had her fair share of boyfriends and step dads.  She just finished high school and is ready to go to college clear across the country so she can escape her family.  Remy was prepared to have a fun, free summer; but fate had a different plan for her.  As she was helping her mother plan for her fifth wedding, she found a new boyfriend she was not expecting.  Dexter teaches her how to love and he is the first boy she never had to give ""the Speech"" to. 

This is a book that girls can connect to, and they can understand how Remy feels about moving away and learning how to live life on her own.  It also teaches you how you never can expect to find the perfect guy you have imagined in you mind.  The perfect man does not look like a movie star or act like a gentlemen; it's a man that makes you happy when you are sad and dries your tears when you cry. Dexter is not like Remy's thoughts of a perfect man he is everything she did not want, but in the end he is everything she does.

Sarah Dessen has written many books similar to This Lullaby. Sarah has written The Truth about Forever, and many other books in the Young Adult genre.  She writes books that teenaged girls can understand and relate to.  She also puts everyday things into situations that girls can relate to.  Mrs. Dessen has been awarded many awards for her books. As fair back as Sarah can remember she has been writing.  Now she is a professor at the University of North Carolina, where she teaches creative writing. She also lives in North Carolina with her loving husband.

Sarah Dessen is a well known writer when it comes to young adults.  She really captors the fascination with Remy's love life, and life in general; also with how Remy responds to things. This Lullaby is a book that almost every teenage girl will love."

Philadelphia attorney Ellie Hathaway obtains an acquittal for her client, which earns her a job offer from one of the legal elite firms.  However, instead of elation, Ellie feels guilty for gaining freedom for a pediophile who molested at least six children.  Ellie walks out on her lover of eight years, seeking sanctuary with her aunt in the heart of Amish Country East Paradise, Lancaster County.      Shortly after her arrival, Ellie is asked to take on the case of eighteen-year-old Amish woman Katie Fisher, accused of killing her newborn child.  Katie hid her pregnancy before she went to the family barn to give birth by herself.  She wrapped her baby in a shirt and fell asleep.  When the teen awakened, the infant was gone.  Later the dead child was found and Katie accused of smothering the baby.  Ellie agrees to take on an ¿Old Order¿ client that the lawyer thinks is guilty in an English court.      Judy Picoult is a gifted storyteller whose compelling works profoundly impact her audience.  Anyone who wants a glimpse at the Amish culture will want to read PLAIN TRUTH.  The complex charcaters appear more like multi-dimensional people who capture a niche in the reader¿s heart.

616,Plain Truth,0743275012,Jodi Picoult,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,This is one of my favorite books by Jodi Picoult and I think that it's a great book for young women. I highly recommend this book for book clubs as its very open for opioins an so forth. Again-it's a must read and am sure everyone will enjoy it!!
617,Orange Is the New Black,0385523386,Piper Kerman,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Anonymous,"I was so disappointed with this book, I couldn't even finish it. Kerman took absolutely no responsibility for what she did. She offered no explanations besides, wow it's exciting to get involved with a lesbian lover and drug smuggling ring right after college. Um- no it's not. She glosses over her involvement, implied she did nothing wrong, and acted like it's so easy to get away from that life. Just hop on a plane to San Fran and get a new boyfriend! I thought it would get better once her prison sentence started, but I was wrong. There was nothing interesting here. Kerman comes across as an elitist snob who taught the prisoners how to read! She saved them with her college education! Listening to her moan about the indignities of prison was more than I could bear, especially when it seemed like she was going to detail Martha Stewart's stay there. That was enough for me."
617,Orange Is the New Black,0385523386,Piper Kerman,Barnes and Noble,3.7,VLB72,"The author really builds up a terrifying, fear-for-your life-behind-bars story when it seems like the worst that happened was she had her feelings hurt. I've watched documentaries on life in women's prison that were truly terrifying (watch the first episode of the A&E show ""Beyond Scared Straight"" to see what I was expecting). This book reiterates the cushy life of a Federal prison I had already pictured - nothing out of the ordinary that this author suggests. The author also never owns up to deserving this sentence and had the full support of friends and family. She was embarrassed by all the support she received, which I found insulting considering the number of women who have no one! By the middle of the book, I found the author to come across as superior and unhumbled by her situation, constantly referring to her New York lifestyle of wine and expensive dinners, so I stopped reading."

I kept waiting for something ""prison like"" to happen to her. She made it sound like everyone was so nice, helpful supportive, they even gave parties. I want to go there!! EVERY member of her family was supportive of her too. Nothing negative was said. EVER. The gaurds yelled but were generally nice. She got a transfer of jobs from the head CO when another CO said something mean to her. Come on, its prison!! I felt the story was boring, and i continued to wait for something interesting to happen to her and it never did. Disappointing read."

This was always my favorite Sherlock Holmes story and the most scary Holmes book I ever read. Many movies were made from this book, but if you want the real deal, without the interpetations, you have to read the book. Plenty of atmosphere in a Holmes book, with a little imagination you can find yourself knocking on the door at 221B Baker street with a curious matter that needs Mr. Holmes attention.  R Hemingway"
618,The Hound of the Baskervilles,0451528018,"Arthur Conan Doyle, Anne Perry",Barnes and Noble,4.3,dandubovoy,"The book by Arthur Conan Doyle, The Hound of the Baskervilles would make a reader very entertained, scared, and relieved in the end. It starts off slow and later hooks the reader to the point that you don&rsquo;t want to stop reading. When the plot unfolds the person reading will sit and read until the end, it is truly a great detective book. The use of the language can be hard at times, however if using a dictionary it wont be hard. The book starts at 221B Baker St where Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson live. Watson finds a walking stick with a bite mark in the middle from a dog. Later there is a man telling the two men that there is a curse on the Baskerville family, and a mysterious hound is killing the family members for decades. The plot gets more interesting when the reader finds out that recently the hound kills one of the members of the family. There is more to tell, but my job is to write what I think about the book. This book should be read by people of all ages, even adults. It is truly a great mystery fiction novel about friendship and knowledge. If you are looking for something that is not huge and something that can keep you interested look no further. Meanwhile I will go back to reading it again."

The reason being his abduction of a peasant's daughter living in the village. A wild, savage hound ejecting fire from its mouth and body is said to have killed Hugo in the moor.The scene was so intimidating that one of revelers had died on seeing the hound.Sir Charles encloses this incident in a letter just three days before his demise so that the next heir of the Baskerville property is warned before he comes to the Baskerville hall.They find his dead body with his face down on the ground on the moor. The moor is very sparsely populated place. There is Stapleton, a naturalist living with his sister, Frankland an old man who abandoned his daughter and many small stone huts.The story gets really intriguing and probing after Sir.Henry, the only living heir after Sir.

619,"Thinking, Fast and Slow",0374275637,Daniel Kahneman,Barnes and Noble,4.2,StudentoftheBuddha,"I've read a number of books that touched upon subject matter similar to this one - Taleb's ""Fooled by Randomness"" and the ""Drunkard's Walk"" by Mlodinow. Those books cite Kahneman's research as source material, and so I was quite excited to read this book by a giant in this field of research. Overall, I think this is an exceptionally readable and thorough treatment of frequent cognitive errors that people make. Even though I'd read the other two books, I still found this one to be very interesting, especially for the system 1/2 model that Kahneman puts forth. He also reinforces the material on a regular basis, so hopefully, it will be sticky and memorable. Although Kahneman is an academic, I think this book will be readable and accessible to a wide audience. So I would give him high marks for that. The only thing I am struggling with is a despair that I will never be able to overcome the shortcomings of my hardware... And oh yeah, this is a long book, but I guess you get your money's worth!"
619,"Thinking, Fast and Slow",0374275637,Daniel Kahneman,Barnes and Noble,4.2,RolfDobelli,"The topics that Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman addresses are both complex and integral to the human mind: He asks you to think about thinking by considering how your mind habitually contradicts itself, distorts data and misleads you. His prose is lucid, his reasoning rigorous and his honesty refreshing &ndash; more than once Kahneman illustrates conflicted thinking with examples from his own life. The result is a fairly slow read, but an ultimately rewarding experience. getAbstract recommends this book to anyone interested in neuroscience and neuroeconomics, and to all those who want to improve their thinking about thinking."
619,"Thinking, Fast and Slow",0374275637,Daniel Kahneman,Barnes and Noble,4.2,popscipopulizer,"*A full executive summary of this book is available at newbooksinbrief dot com.

The adage &lsquo;you are what you eat&rsquo; is no doubt literally true, but when it comes to getting at the heart of what we are it is certainly more accurate to say &lsquo;you are what you think&rsquo;; for our identity emerges out of the life of the mind, and our decisions and actions (including what we eat) is determined by our thoughts. An exploration of how we think therefore cuts to the core of what we are, and offers a clear path to gaining a better understanding of ourselves and why we behave as we do. In addition, while many of us are fairly happy with how our mind works, few of us would say that we could not afford to improve here at least in some respects; and therefore, an exploration of how we think also promises to point the way towards fruitful self-improvement (which stands to help us both in our personal and professional lives). While thinking about thinking was traditionally a speculative practice (embarked upon by philosophers and economists) it has recently received a more empirical treatment through the disciplines of psychology and neuroscience. It is from the latter angle that the Nobel Prize winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman approaches the subject in his new book 'Thinking, Fast and Slow'.

As the title would suggest, Kahneman breaks down thinking into 2 modes or systems. Slow thinking is the system that we normally think of as thought in the strictest sense. It is deliberate and conscious, and we naturally feel as though we are in control of it (Kahneman refers to it as system 2). System 2 is in play when we actively consider what we want to have for dinner tonight, or when we choose what stocks to buy, or when we perform a mathematical calculation. System 1, by contrast, is automatic and unconscious, and hums along continuously in the background. It constantly surveys the environment, and processes the incoming stimuli with razor speed.

The impressions of system 1 are fairly effective in protecting us from moment to moment, but they are much less effective in long-term planning; and therefore, they are much more problematic here. Of course, system 2 is capable of overriding the impressions of system 1, and of avoiding the errors. However, as Kahneman points out, system 2 is often completely unaware that it is being influenced (and misled) by system 1; and therefore, is not naturally well-equipped to catch the errors. Much of the book is spent exploring the activities and biases of system 1, in order to make us more aware of how this system works and how it influences (and often misleads) system 2.

This is only half the battle, though, for while system 2 may be naturally poorly equipped to catch the errors of system 1, it is also often poorly equipped to correct these errors. Indeed, Kahneman argues that system 2 is simply not a paragon of rationality, and could stand to use a good deal of help in this regard. This is another major concern of the book.

Kahneman does a very good job of breaking down the workings of the mind, and presenting his findings in a very readable way. My only objection to the book is that the arguments are sometimes drawn out much more than needed, and there is a fair bit of repetition. A full executive summary of the book is available at newbooksinbrief dot com; a podcast discussion of the book will be available shortly thereafter."
620,"The Mists of Avalon (Avalon, #1)",0345350499,Marion Zimmer Bradley,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anthrogrl,"Marion Zimmer Bradley gives a refreshing and poignant retelling of the King Arthur legend...from Morgaine's perspective.  Traditionally portrayed as an evil seductress, Bradley has Morgaine as the narrator of the story, and offers insight into the characters' motivations, feelings and reasons for their actions.  Each character ultimately affects the final outcome of King Arthur's rule.

What I enjoyed most about this novel was how the author places Arthur in a more historical setting (c. late 6th century A.D.).  Bradley's portrayals of Morgaine, Arthur, Guinevere, Lancelot and Merlin bring a more human aspect to these famous persons.

Bradley also does an amazing job of discussing the religious and political conflicts during Arthur's reign, specifically between the followers of the Goddess and the emerging Chrisitian religion.

If you enjoy romance, historical fiction, epic stories, or just a good read, Bradley's  'The Mists of Avalon' won't disappoint you."

My life was never the same.  I had always loved myths and legends, and was fond of the King Arthur tales I read as a little girl.  But it was this book that revealed to me my true path in life.  I fell completely in love with Morgen Le Fay and was captivated by the perspective it took on Arthurian lore.  This book truly showed me my true course in life, and I am now preparing to begin my PhD in Medieval Studies.  I used this book heavily in my master's thesis, and was surprised to find that although I was reading it for the 3rd time, it still incited great feelings of emotion in me, feelings of anguish, passion, repulsion, and love.  You truly fall in love and connect with Bradley's characters, who seem to come to life before you.  She is a brilliant author and this book is an eye-opener and a feast for the senses."

'Nights in Rodanthe' is a light read, but Sparks pulls it off. This book is passionate, and sensitive. Readers get pulled into this love story. Any woman would love to have a relationship like the one Paul and Adrianne found for eachother all in a matter of a few days. You will be sucked into this book when you start. In the end you will probably find yourself crying.. Yes its that good. The characters are unforgetable!Read this book. If you find yourself reading one, you will more than likely start reading more of his books. From past to present you will be locked in."

I love Nicholas Sparks books but this one was a page turner but not in that exciting can't wait to see whats next kinda thing. It was more like you knew the ending but didn't want it to happen kinda thing.
623,"Mr. Mercedes (Bill Hodges Trilogy, #1)",1476754454,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.2,APratt0414,"I love Stephen King. That has not changed in the 20+ years I've been reading his work. What also hasn't changed is his ability to suck me into a story and bury me so deep that I have lost all sense of time and spatial awareness. I become one with the story and nothing else matters. I can't think, I can't eat, I can't sleep until I am finished living the lives of the people in the book. There is nothing like being immersed in a world that has been created by Mr. King. It is an experience that one does not ever fully return from or fully leave behind. He has perfected his craft so well that each story, each character breaks off a bit and embeds it into your soul for you to mull over, dwell on, and contemplate until your demise. I am happy to let him have those spaces to deposit his leavings as I feel a sense of completeness after each one. It's like he has found missing pieces and is putting them back where they belong. I don't believe that there are any other authors out there that have that affect on me but it doesn't stop me from searching. I almost feel like there is a subliminal message in each of his books that speaks to the innermost part of me, like a nagging voice, &quot;You will read my next story. You will because you need to. You need the drug that I supply.&quot;  It's kind of how I think of tattoos as having a chemical in them that make them addictive. No matter the pain, the time, nor the money lost, as soon as you have the first one, you want another. And every time you get another one, it happens again....the craving is there for another. That is what Stephen King is like for me."

Bill has betrayed her in every way - she herself realizes that she must move on (of course, every woman never forgets the first love of her life - so be it!). Sookie wants to be first, but that isn't possible with Quinn - hence, his quick departure. There is one man/vampire who has never betrayed her and, although always blunt and sometimes brutal in his truth, Eric has always been there for Sookie and she has proven herself to be his equal in every way. Eric knows this, too, which is why I believe he loves her. I went back and read every book over again carefully and you will see the hints of Bill's betrayal and the beginnings of Eric's support and deep feelings.I'm sure the next book will deal with Sookie's connection to her great-grandfather, and I hope Charlaine Harris will give a true relationship  a chance for Sookie and Eric. Let's see how it works out! I'm sure game!The secondary characters are fabulous and make the whole series - Sam, Amelia, PAM(!), Bubba, and a host of others. I have a feeling we are going to be introduced to some really interesting ""beings"" in the next book, so don't keep us waiting too long, Ms. Harris! Thanks for giving us a wonderful series that I never want to see end!P.S. The only reason I rate the book covers so low is that they make Sookie look like a child and I don't understand that... Sookie would hate being represented that way!"

I really liked Quinn in the last book, but in this book we learn that HE has a few secrets that he's not sharing with Sookie, too. I felt the sex scene was too short.

I believe the point of view this story is told from really impacted my enjoyment and eager interest while reading. Many significant, acute details are smudged and hidden throughout the book, but the author skillfully places them in spots I never seemed to forget. This made it important for complete comprehension. 
It truly is a unique plot that adds momentum as its told and allows the reader to see both points of view, which I think is a big part of the writer's intention for the story. 
I very much enjoyed this."
625,Midwives,0375706771,Chris Bohjalian,Barnes and Noble,4.1,JHiggy23,"I was an English major when I was in college and have read at least a book a week for years.  Midwives was one of the better books I've read in the past year.  It is not a unique story in its construction, but it is unique in its topic.  Some critics have referred to it as the modern To Kill a Mockingbird.  While it certainly is not up to that level (what is?), it is a great book in its own right.

The characters were immediately involving, even if characterization is not extensive.  Bohjalian did a great job of taking me inside the mind of a 14 year old girl witnessing the trial of her mother.  There is no doubt that he has a simplistic but elegant prose style that is both involving and enjoyable to read.

The previous two reviewers really missed the point of the novel, I must say."
625,Midwives,0375706771,Chris Bohjalian,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"This novel is a must read which narrates the case of Sybil Danfoth, a midwife by heart, who attends the childbirth of Charlotte Bedford on a cold and stormy winter night at Charlotte's Vermont home. Charlotte is a fragile woman who, although tries very hard to push, cannot make the baby crown.   After hours of trying, Charlotte doesn't have any pulse nor heart bit and Sybil, aware that the former has perished, performs a cesarean section with a kitchen knife and accomplishes to save the newborn. Nevertheless, before she does so, she tries to reach both her backup doctor and an ambulance, but she couldn't get through any of them. Sybil also tries to get to her station wagon  however, the freezing climate doesn't permit her to start it. Here commences the story.   The state prosecutes Sibyl Danforth for 'involuntary manslaughter' that could send her to jail from one to fifteen years and no more midwifery, do to what the prosecution calls extraordinary negligence from the midwife.  In addition to this fact, the prosecution suspects Charlotte was not death prior to the cesarean section.   So a trial begins and both the prosecution and defense witnesses declare. The narration and prose in general throughout the novel are outstanding and specifically the recounting of the trial is superb. However, when Sibyl is cross questioned she gives out a clue that might be horrendous for her defense...and so it goes.   The narration of all the comings and goings is done by Sybil's daughter, Connie, a fourteen year old adolescent, in the first person singular. This fact definitely turns into an excellent narrative prose.   I give 5 stars for believable and credible story.  I give 5 stars for excellent narration.  I give 5 stars since I couldn't stop reading till the end.    And, above all, I give 5 stars to the author, Chris Bohjalian since he must have gone through a profound research on trials, midwifery, doctors, and obstetrics, among others."

628,"Patriot Games (Jack Ryan Universe, #2)",0425134350,Tom Clancy,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"Tom Clancy¿s Patriot Games is an excellent example of a political thriller that maintains a necessary human factor that is elemental to the story. This is the tale of Jack Ryan, a former marine and now an American tourist in England who breaks up a terrorist attack on the Prince of Wales, heir to the throne. His intervention saved the Heir¿s life, and drew terrorist attention on him and his family.  	Clancy uses heart-stopping action to keep his readers excited and interested. The first attack and exciting climax are exceptional examples of this. The suspense he creates with Ryan and his family is incredible.  	The main character is Jack Ryan, a former Marine lieutenant who now teaches history at Annapolis. Clancy portrays Ryan as a man who will stop at nothing to keep his family safe. He is a man who stands up for what he thinks is right, and is haunted by his conscience for the actions he takes. He is not a warrior but knows how to use his mind, and his Marine training saves his life as well as the lives of others many times.  	The setting for the story is very valuable to the plot. The terrorists in the story are from Ireland, and are very professional. However, the antagonist, Sean Miller, uses a personal tragedy as an excuse to attack Ryan in America. This book was written in 1988, so terrorism was unheard of in America. If the plot had taken place anywhere else, then terrorism would be an understood threat and wouldn¿t be as exciting or foreign a threat. This is crucial to other parts of the plot.  	Clancy uses a 3rd person point of view to tell the story from all sides. Not only does it show what Ryan is thinking and doing, it also follows the terrorists throughout their training and attempts at retribution.   	Clancy also tells the stories of the inner-workings of international Counterterrorism, and the relationships between the British and American efforts. He does this with many characters that can be identified with. One example of this is FBI agent Dan Murray. He is the FBI¿s man in London and he works with the British MI-5 to apprehend international criminals. The author tells of how Murray¿s closest lead is blown when his wiretap is discovered in the suspect¿s store.  	The way Clancy portrays Ryan is one of the main reasons I enjoyed this so much. However, I would have to see the other side of the coin more. He didn¿t explore the terrorist motivations as much as I would have liked, and if he had dived in a little more into their mindset it would have added a very interesting topic.  	I think that this novel is an excellent read, and kept me interested the whole way through. I am no stranger to Tom Clancy¿s other novels, but I feel that his realism and talent really shined in this novel. I could not put it down, and would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good political thriller."

Why not pick up a pointer or two from somebody who's gone much further in her career--and with many more obstacles--than I have in mine?

The list of things Sheryl Sandberg has done that I haven't is lengthy. Too many times I've not spoken up when I've had things to say. At work gathering after work gathering I've failed to sit at the table with key decision makers. Time and time again I downplay myself for fear I'll be seen as a self-promoter.

The book reminded me of something I have done, however. I've moved cross country twice on account of my wife's career. Acknowledging that my wife's profession had more upside than my own wasn't easy, and I feel fortunate that none of my family and friends criticized me for supporting her.

Sandberg's book taught me that other men are not so lucky. I knew of the challenges that women face if they choose to assert themselves in traditionally male dominated careers, but I never appreciated the gender based scrutiny and criticism men face when they choose to support them. Husbands and wives shouldn't have to consider gender related stereotypes when deciding who works outside the home and who works in it. Simply pick the best person for the jobs.

I give the book 4 stars instead of 5 because I think it spends too much time telling men and women to remove gender from their decisions and not enough telling them specifically how."
630,"Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead",0385349947,"Sheryl Sandberg, Nell Scovell",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"As a  young woman entering the business world, I found this book incredibly helpful and relatable. I currently have no marriage 
prospects, but I already have a fear that one day I will have to choose between family and career. Sandberg  made realize that not only 
am I not alone with this concern, but it is also possible to do both. Her insight, advice, and fun stories kept me up long into the night; 
I couldn't put the book down. I am so glad I read this book at such a young age. I highly recommend this book to driven females and
males of all ages.

I also want to comment on a few of the negative posts.  Yes, Sandberg went to Harvard and was the daughter of a doctor. I don't see
how this is relevant. She still had the grades to get into Harvard and had the drive and skills to become successful. Not many people 
will have the same opportunities as she did but every one can relate to the concrete advice she gives you on how to succeed. The fact 
that people are talking about this issue at all is a gender bias. There are plenty of men leaders who were born with a silver spoon but the 
comments on that subject are rare. Secondly, Sandberg does not make any negative comments about mothers who stay at 
home. She mentions many, many times that she respects those women and realizes an executive position isn't everyone's dream. 
This book is for women who want to succeed and want to balance work and family life. This doesn't mean we are better or worse than
the stay at home moms; it simply means we are different. If you do not have the drive to succeed in the business/work/volunteer world, 
this book is simply not for you."

This book makes a shift to focus more on werewolfes and shapeshifters and of course, most of them accept her. We also see a little more from the fairies.The book picks up on the storyline that was laid in book 4. Eric has his memory back, but doesn't remember. Jason has been bitten by a werepanther and is waiting for the first full moon.Someone is trying to kill werewolfs and shifters, the search for Debbie Pelt continues and there are attempts made on Sookie's life. While I would have liked to have seen more with the vampires in this book, we got to see enough of them and the storyline with Eric and Sookie is further developed. (love that) Lots of great and well developed plot in this book.Definetly a page turner and a worthwhile read in this series."
631,"Dead as a Doornail (Sookie Stackhouse, #5)",0441013333,Charlaine Harris,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"After watching 6 seasons of the HBO series based on these books, in many respects I still like the books better (that is, Books 1-10). Unlike most book in a series, I think that the books in this series would make for satisfying stand alone read because the main mystery or mysteries are solved within each book so although the saga continues the books don't end on the typical cliffhanger fashion. Nevertheless, to become truly immersed in the Sookie Stackhouse world I recommend reading the books in order. The reader is again taken on a journey with Sookie through a captivating, humorous and often perilous adventure into the secret world of the two natured and the undead, as well as, the secret thoughts of the living. This edition is filled with loads of action, mystery, danger, suspense and a bit of humor. The writing style leaves a bit to be desired but I love the originality of the plot and the characters so this book, as well as books 1 thru 10, is still primarily a winner in my opinion. Given Sookie's physical attributes, her personality, her zeal for life, her vitality and her special &quot;gift&quot; and heritage I neither find it surprising nor unrealistic or irritating that the supernatural males find her desirable. Besides, it's fantasy people and I for one enjoy Sookie's romantic encounters and almost encounters with such a diverse variety of sinfully sexy and deliciously alpha supernatural males. I always enjoy a sookie book. The characters are great (especially Eric) I love Eric! The crazy situations and things that happen are fun to read about. With mystery and suspense and great characters you can't go wrong!"
631,"Dead as a Doornail (Sookie Stackhouse, #5)",0441013333,Charlaine Harris,Barnes and Noble,4.4,ReadingQueen12-17,"I don't know if Ms. Harris was a little tired after all the effort she put into the first 4 books but book 5 in the Stackhouse series reads like a drawn out afterthought; a little nonsensical and very often dull.  In Doornail there is a sniper on the loose taking out members of the supernatural world.  Sookie endures the usual litany of sticky situations and mortal injuries but this time around the story is extremely diluted with pointless commentary and insufferable podunk metaphors (""my face burned like a pack of fire ants"").  Cue the banjo.     
Furthermore, this book is somewhat hard to follow.  Many of the pivotal characters are people/things that have never before been referenced and there are times when the dialogue is completely without context; ""I turned to Maryelizabeth and her daughter and thanked them for the glass of water.  Maryelizabeth gave me a hostile look and said to her daughter 'We should've never sent you to school'"". What?  What does that have to do with anything?  I very often read after I've had a couple (six) glasses of wine but I have a pretty good recollection of the major action items in this story and Maryelizabeth's daughter's education had nothing to do with anything and while we're at it, who the hell is Maryelizabeth?
I mean, I'm going to continue reading the series (if anything it makes the HBO series more fun to watch) but I sincerely hope later stories have a little more umph."
632,"Shatter Me (Shatter Me, #1)",0062085484,Tahereh Mafi,Barnes and Noble,4.4,pagese,"Well this was a surprise.  I actually didn't set my standards too high for this one because I just didn't feel like I had enough to go on.  It sounded intriguing and the cover is awesome.  I actually ended up tearing through it and the storyline kept me guessing.

 
I was instantly drawn to Juliette.  She's completely isolated from society.  She doesn't speak or touch other humans.  Her only communication with the outside world is the alarms that signal different part of the day (but those aren't even an regular intervals).  She's been shunned her entire life, and feels like even her own parents wanted nothing to do with her.  She may not like being all alone, but she feels being away from society is the best thing for her.  And even she doesn't know what she's fully capable of. 

Entire in Adam.  He suddenly appears as her cellmate.  She's terrified of being around another human.  She doesn't trust why he's there, and for very good reason.  It's a test she passes with flying colors.  The Reestablishment wants to use her as a weapon to bring those who defy them under their control.  She's taken from her cell into a house rich in luxuries she never had in the outside world.  But, she's has no desire to use her touch to bring people pain, no matter how grandly she is treated.  

Warner is the leader of The Reestablishment's son.  He seems to get a particularly gruesome kick out of the pain the Juliette can cause people.  He's the one who wants to use her for his own gain.  His character really intrigued me.  He's extremely twisted and is convinced that Juliette enjoys it as much as he does.  He will stop at nothing to keep her under his control.  The tests he sets up for Juliette to perform were horrible!

The story takes an interesting twist when we learn that Adam is not all that he seems.  It turns out he has a special connection to Juliette which he plays to his advantage.  For awhile, I wasn't sure which side he was truly on, which is I'm sure how that author intended you to feel.  When the truth comes out, I ended up completely in love with his character.  

As Adam and Juliette learn who they can trust concerning what is really happening in the outside world, the story starts racing forward at breathtaking speed.  There for some many things that happened that I really wasn't expecting.  This wasn't your typical dystopian and I think that's why I was so surprised by it.  I ended up really enjoying it.  Can't wait for the next one!"

Due to the romance in the novel, I would not recommend it to anyone under 15; it was not as inappropriate as a romance novel, but some parts got close, and I know some parents look out for that for their 13 year olds. Otherwise, there were no curse words that caught my attention, and I really enjoyed it. I highly recommend it."

633,Starship Troopers,0441783589,Robert A. Heinlein,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Cyreenik,"""Starship Troopers"" by Robert Heinlein was the first science fiction story I ever read, way back in 7th grade or so (1960). That book was the first inspiring book I read by myself, and started me on a years-long devotion to reading science fiction. It was really inspiring. In 1990, I reread ""Starship Troopers"", and as I read it, I was surprised: it didn't feel like I was reading the same story. My impression the second time was of a ""Sands of Iwo Jima in Space"" instead of something entirely new and different. (and I was kind of shocked at how much living thirty years had changed my perspective!) Either way, the heart of the story was power armor, how to use it, and how its presence affected people's thinking. In this story Heinlein proposed that to become a citizen -- someone who voted on how to run the government -- a person needed to first demonstrate some responsibility to the community. .Sounded good to me, but for taking that stance many critics labeled this book as supporting fascism. In 1997 I saw the Starship Troopers movie, and saw that the director had missed the point of the story entirely by taking out the power armor. Without power armor, the soldiers were transformed into World War One ""over the top"" infantry who would be discouraged from asking ""Why?"" before they marched off into a do-or-die situation, and because of that, they lost any reason to be ""responsible for the community"" in the sense that Heinlein was emphasizing in his book version of the story. Unlike the book, the movie really was about a Fascist/Spartan ""Come back with your shield or on it."" mentality. These changes in what I read, and misinterpretations in what I saw depicted in the movie, inspired me to write my own version of the power armor story, and you can find it in my short story ""The Ticket Out"" in ""Tips for Tailoring Spacetime Fabric Vol. 1"" (Vol. 1 is about stories in space, and Vol. 2 is about stories on Earth). So in the end, I still found the book inspiring, but the movie a whole lot less so. Yeah, this is one of those ""read the book, you'll like it a lot better""-cases."
633,Starship Troopers,0441783589,Robert A. Heinlein,Barnes and Noble,4.4,SNUSooner,"Although the movie was loosely based on this book, it is not the same. It is amazing to me that it was written in the 50's but is such a social commentary on our world today. When I was in the Army, I used to make my soldiers read it and give me a report about what it meant to them. Awesome read!"
633,Starship Troopers,0441783589,Robert A. Heinlein,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Graeme1949,"This is a very interesting and thought-provoking book on several levels. There is the military level, the science level and the political/social level. (The 1997 movie, by the way, has practically no relation to the book.) 

Military: I first read this book in the late 1960s, when I was on active duty in the Marine Corps. Then, it was a good future-war book with some outlandish science thrown in. 

Science: with the simple passage of time, much of the science has become more real. Many of the far-out things RAH described in 1959 are now in actual use in the military - if not directly, then as recognizable equivalents. Laser range-finders. In-helmet displays that show the full tactical situation from many sensors. Communication systems that can link every soldier. Directed energy weapons (although they are not man-portable yet.) And now the military is developing a powered exoskeleton for soldiers - only the armor needs to be added to make &quot;now&quot; match Heinlein's vision of 1959. 

Political and Social: I did not really discover this level - which I now believe is the most important - until the early to mid-1970s, when I was a Political Science major at the University of Maryland. It resonates for me because I am an immigrant, and Heinlein's political thesis could be taken from the Oath of Allegiance that every naturalized citizen takes. It is (mostly) a concise statement of the obligations of ALL citizens. 
&quot;I hereby declare, on oath, that I ... will bear arms on behalf of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform noncombatant service in the armed forces of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under civilian direction when required by the law; ...&quot; 
In the world of Starship Troopers, the United States (and all other countries) are unified into a single world government. In that world, everyone has the right to do as they please with their life in every area except political. You cannot vote unless you are a citizen. (There is no citizenship at birth.) How does one become a citizen in that world? By doing the things required since 1920 of all US Citizens in our Oath of Allegiance: bear arms on behalf of the government, or perform noncombatant service in the Armed Forces, or perform work of national importance under civilian direction. This is all voluntary - you are not drafted (at the beginning of the book, at least). A person in this world becomes a citizen by enlisting in the military or working in government civil service for a period of time. Usually that term is only a few years, you leave it as a citizen, and have earned the right to vote. However, there is the little catch - and it was there when I enlisted in the Marine Corps (before I became a US citizen, by the way.) My term was six years, unless I was directed to stay longer by order of the President because of war or national emergency. For the characters in the book, a war happened to break out while they were in training ... 

Even though it was written in 1959, this book is still relevant today. For me, now, it is mostly relevant as a reminder of how far science has come in a little over 50 years - and how close to today's reality Heinlein's vision was. I also review it for the political thesis, which is always worth thinking about - the concept that one thing, the ability to help select those who govern - must be EARNED rather than handed out at birth."

637,The Martian Chronicles,0553278223,Ray Bradbury,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Scotman55,"The Martian Chronicles

Ray Bradbury&rsquo;s recent passing created an opportunity to reread some of his stories and novels.  No, I don&rsquo;t like all that Bradbury wrote, but his whimsical, lyrical style always attracted me.  He could create a world of &ldquo;Firemen&rdquo; in Fahrenheit 451 or the mysterious characters of &ldquo;The Illustrated Man&rdquo; and leave me entranced.

The Martian Chronicles was no exception!

First Impressions:

The book itself is a loosely-knit series of short stories, one leading to the next, in date order in the writer&rsquo;s 21st century future.  Here we have Earth that is looking towards Mars as a haven from the brewing atomic wars and rumors of such.  What impressed me was the stylized characters and fleshed-out civilizations and how both Martian and Earthman deal with each other, as well as their own jealousies and prejudices. 

Stories! 

I won&rsquo;t bore the reader with a mini-review of each tale, but the few that I really liked involved some of the crazy characters &ndash; one an off-kilter man, Spender, part of a crew from the Fourth Expedition, who didn&rsquo;t want to see Mars commercialized as he looked upon the dead Martian civilization (destroyed by Man&rsquo;s diseases &ndash; holy War of the Worlds!) and decides to kill off his own men and keep the planet pristine!  That plan does not go over well with Captain Wilder.  The darkness of the story and its clear criticism of colonialism were enticing to me. 

The other story I really liked involved the last colonists on Mars (the rest being called back to Earth because of atomic war) who missed the last rocket, and gets lonely.  Far off, he hears a phone ring.  He finally finds who rang it, hoping for some female company, but the guy isn&rsquo;t so lonely that he does not have standards!

Finally, the tale of a Martian and an Earth worker, both going to a party driving in their respective vehicles and meet each other on a lonely road &ndash; 10,000 years apart!  Crazy.

Bottom Line:  Most of the stories flow well one to the other.  Ray does reflect some of the 1940s&rsquo; style prejudices of the time which may put off modern readers, but if you read Ray&rsquo;s poetic style in its historic context, you too will see that a lot of his criticism and satire is still quite relevant. 

Highly recommended!"
637,The Martian Chronicles,0553278223,Ray Bradbury,Barnes and Noble,4.2,BrianIndianFan,"There's really not much that one can say that hasn't already been said about this classic science fiction set of stories...but I'll try.

This collection of short stories was originally published in the early 1950s. Drawing upon his influences - such as Edgar Rice Burrough's &quot;John Carter&quot; series - Bradbury tells the story of the first interactions between the aboriginal Martians and humans and then the eventual full-scale colonization of the red planet.

This colonization and interaction take place against the backdrop of tense times on earth - a reflection of the escalating Cold War between the Americans and the Soviet Union. One could also see this as a replay of European colonization of North America - if the Indians had telepathy and better weapons. Ultimately, the 4th expedition discovers that the entire Martian civilization has been wiped out by chicken pox - a disease that sickened earth children, but almost never killed them. It is an ironic counterpoint to Wells' &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; that Bradbury brings the killing virus to the Martians.

The middle third of the story continues with the colonization of Mars. The interactions with the remaining Martians are fewer, with the emphasis on terraforming the 4th planet - in habitation if not evironmentally. Of course, humans have fled to Mars, but their humanity has stowed away and made its home there as well. The story &quot;Usher II&quot; addresses the issue of censorship; an issue that has metastasized in our day into political correctness. This theme of censorship by a heavy-handed government would be further developed by Bradbury in Fahrenheit 451.

Ultimately, somebody on earth decided to push the button, and full-scale nuclear war breaks out. Seeing earth aflame, most Martian settlers elect to return to earth (why?). The last third of the book tells the tale of the remainder of humanity making his last stand as permanent residents on Mars.

Since the book as originally published was going to fall victim to the Moody Blues &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot;, the 1997 re-release of the book pushed all dates ahead by 31 years so that they run from 2030 to 2057 (as opposed to the original 1999-2026). This keeps the book from being looked upon as an anachronism. The publisher has also gone inside the stories themselves to make sure that they are consistent with the revised dating.

Having now read both &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; and this book, I will at some point attempt to read Kim Stanley Robinson's &quot;Mars Trilogy&quot; which may take some of these themes to another level.

BOTTOM LINE: If you love science fiction and haven't read this, shame on you for six weeks."
638,A Visit from the Goon Squad,0307592839,Jennifer Egan,Barnes and Noble,3.7,cmichaelcook,"The publisher really should have taken a bit more time formatting this book for the Nook. (Or any ereader, really. I've heard the following complaint from users of competing readers as well.)

In the chapter that's written in Powerpoint format, the ""slides"" really are too small to be read comfortably on the Nook. They fill less than half the page, and unless you're in a brightly lit room with good eyes (or glasses) you'll probably strain to read the pages.

And no, changing the font size doesn't do anything to improve the situation.

They collectively give us a snapshot of the class system in modern America and an examination of where ""art"" ends in music and commercialism begins. Many of the characters could be the basis of an excellent novel and their reappearance from different views over many decades of narrative gives a novel-like depth to them. By writing as a collection of stories, Ms. Egan is able to experiment with different voices and styles of writing which make reading the collection more interesting. I was also quite intrigued by the presentation of one story in a non-traditional format that dominates much of my professional communication (don't want to give the details away).

639,Heidi,0753454947,"Johanna Spyri, Angelo  Rinaldi, Beverly Cleary",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Cougar_H,"Heidi by Johanna Spyri is an inspiring story about a girl who lives in the 1800's in Germany. Heidi is a five year old orphan who has been living with her aunt for most of her life. When her aunt gets a job in Frankkfurt, she takes Heidi to live with her grandfather in the little village called Dorfli. Heidi's grandfather is said to be a very mean man that frightens many people. Heidi must face her grandfather alone.
 Heidi is a cheerful girl and she tries her best to be friendly with her grandfather. She soon begins to worm her way into his old heart and many of the other villagers in Dorfli. She makes friends with almost everyone she meets. She even gets her grandfather to come down from his mountain to be around the villagers that he separated himself from years ago. Around Heidi's 8th birthday,her aunt comes back to take Heidi to Frankfurt where there is a girl named Klara who is in a wheelchair and is in need of a companion. Heidi is very sad to have to leave her mountains and her grandfather, but she goes anyway.
 Heidi has many adventures with Klara and even begins to like being in Frankfurt, but she still misses the mountains. Everyday she begs to go home. Finally, they send her back to live with her grandfather in her beloved mountains.
 Heidi by Johanna Spyri is a classic children's story loved by many people. I would recommend this book because it was very enjoyable and I learned a lot.

This book makes me feel at home with the fireplace on making me feel warm and cozy. There are no unbearably sad parts or scary parts in this book.  Good read for mos t all ages - very heartwarming."
640,Prey,0061015725,Michael Crichton,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"Prey  By Michael Crichton  Reviewed by Josh   	There are always problems with finding a good book to read. You want to try to find a topic you like, and then you see if the book has a well known reliable author, then you see how long the book is. All these challenges can be solved with this book  Prey by Michael Crichton.  	I initially chose this book on a recommendation from my dad. He had just recently read it and said it was an extraordinary book. Unfortunately, I wasn¿t very keen on reading a 300 odd page book  however I was looking for something enticing and something I was interested in. He had recommended this book before but I had put the idea aside. Finally we were assigned an independent reading assignment, so I said ¿Ah, why not,¿ and I picked it up and started to read. Ever since then, I haven¿t been able to put the book down.  	If you¿re a person that¿s interested in today¿s technology and science this is definitely a book for you. This is a realistically based fiction of technology and modern science with a bit of romance. Jack Forman, a currently unemployed programmer is assigned the position of ¿house dad¿ and he¿s doing a heck of a job, but when things start going awry with his hard working wife Julia, he starts to suspect she¿s having an affair in     Townsend 2  the office. She works at Xymos Technology, one of the leading technology distributors in the Silicon Valley. Jack is hired as a consultant to Xymos and takes a trip out to the companies¿ fabrication building. He is surprised to find out they are currently programming nanotechnology as a military weapon. After they get the technology advanced enough, the nano- bots begin to learn from experience and think on the spot. This ends up as a terrible outcome and could mean the end of human civilization as we know it. Crichton has done a magnificent job with his descriptive sci-fi action writing  It really makes you think you¿re in the story  so much, that it¿s scary.  	Though Prey is a great read, I would suggest limits and restrictions. It should be noted that if you are influenced by harsh language, this book is definitely not for you. There are feelings expressed in language that normally would not be accepted as polite or even correct for that matter. Also, there is slight sexual content but nothing to be alarmed about. Other than that, this book is a fantastic read and should be taken into consideration next time you¿re looking for a book worth your while. Prey is for those interested in today¿s modern science and technology, and for those looking for a good book. I recommend this book if you are looking for a good action adventure and a story that will keep you on the edge of your seat. But be careful, to be human¿is to be hunted."
640,Prey,0061015725,Michael Crichton,Barnes and Noble,4.1,bookworm71CH,"Keeps you in suspense for the entire read.  Don't know much about nanotechnology, but the implicantions are frightful, if maybe unrealistic in this book.  If you like suspense, this is for you."
640,Prey,0061015725,Michael Crichton,Barnes and Noble,4.1,EBoges,"Prey is a book by the famous author Michael Crichton. He has written many other famous and award winning books that are also worth a read. Prey itself is a book that commands you to keep reading it all the way through. It is definitely worthy of anyone who reads love stories or science fiction romance novels. This book is also similar to some other Crichton books that follow the theme of massive technological discovery destroying humans for their insolence and hubris. The protagonist of prey is Jack Forman. He is a middle aged father of three that has a loving wife and a good job. Everything goes wrong from here, Jack has almost everything taken from him and events push him to the edge. It starts with his job being taken away and then his family is also hurt. This leads to other events that show how human expansion of technology can be very dangerous. Michael Crichton's style can be summarized by saying that he allows the actions to speak for themselves. He perfectly balances action and suspense, and romance and dialogue. He writes in a style that purely exemplifies the actions that are pushing you to your seat. Prey is also divided into 4 parts that all have specific problems and answers. Each part seems to answer one of the questions you are thinking, but as each is answered another is proposed until finally the final truth is revealed. I highly recommend this book as one that will entertain and surprise."
641,"The Last Battle (Chronicles of Narnia, #7)",0007202326,C.S. Lewis,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,This was a wonderful ending to one of the best childrens series ever.  Though I am 28 and I am still reading them!  I loved this book.
641,"The Last Battle (Chronicles of Narnia, #7)",0007202326,C.S. Lewis,Barnes and Noble,4.3,piggyx3,"C.S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia is a classic read for anyone young and old and should take  high priority on anyone's ""to read"" list. Concluding this series for the first time I've read The Last Battle. This story is a simple allegory of religious themes including the final battle, the antichrist, and the final judgment. The story begins with an ape named Shift and his friend, a donkey, named Puzzle. Shift who is devious by nature finds the skin of a lion and tricks his less intelligent friend Puzzle to wear the suit in order to pass him off as the lion Aslan, a mysterious Christ like figure in all of C. S. Lewis's books.
	The ape Shift asserts himself as the speaker on behalf of the donkey dressed as Aslan, who is only allowed to come out at night and must stay further away from the crowds in order to convince them that he is the real Aslan. Shift uses his newfound power to manipulate the masses into giving him what he wants, which leads to the destruction of Narnia in a final battle where it is destroyed. 
	Some familiar characters from previous books make cameo appearances as the book progresses. Unfortunately Susan is not included among them because she is ""no longer a friend of Narnia"" and interested ""in nothing nowadays except nylons and lipstick and invitations"". This idea of course highlighting the theme of lost faith. 
	This book is an exciting read and I would recommend it to anyone. Lewis asserts a lot of religious themes and ideas that most anyone can appreciate such as love, tolerance, compassion, and righteous living. For those who have not read his other books or are not familiar with his writing style this book may appear a bit slow or confusing at times. There are a lot of times that ideas and thought are emphasized more so than battle or action sequences, but since a good fight scene is not the primary goal of this book that is okay by me. 
	Again, I strongly recommend this book. Besides being a classic it is also an enjoyable climax to the life and story of that magical place called Narnia."
641,"The Last Battle (Chronicles of Narnia, #7)",0007202326,C.S. Lewis,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,All the books of the Chronicles of Narnia are very inspirational.  I recommend then to people of all ages.
642,"World Without End (The Kingsbridge Series, #2)",0525950079,Ken Follett,Barnes and Noble,4.2,chakosh,"First off, Pillars of the Earth is one of my all-time favorite books.  I loved the politics and intrigue in that book.  Expecting big things from a sequel that took over a decade to complete, I was hoping Follett would have the same types of subject matter.  This book follows descendants of the main characters of Pillars, focusing mostly on Merthin the builder and his brother Ralph.  The book focuses more on graphic descriptions of sex, rape, and battles rather than the interesting politics and architecture of the times like Pillars.  The plot twists are fairly predictable, and Follett really makes this a Job-like story of Merthin and Caris.  That would be fine if he stopped after ""twist"" number 3, but continuously bringing in ""challenges"" for the main characters gets old after a while.  When a character started getting uninteresting, Follett had the foresight to set his novel in the 1300s and would kill them off using the Black Plague.

Considering the book is over 1000 pages, I was really expecting him to go into detail the bridge architecture that his character envisions, or the tower, or the hospitals, or the palaces...  He has the characters spend time in France and Italy, and barely even describes any of the architecture or lifestyle in those countries (conveniently one of the characters is bedridden in Italy, and there is plague and war in France).  Instead, he focuses more on unrequited love, unimaginatively evil villains, an excessive number of graphic descriptions of sex and rape, and teenager-like descriptions of battles.

Characters are a pretty shallow - the heroes are obnoxiously saintly, and the villains are blatantly manipulative and evil.  It's difficult to care much about the characters when they're so polarized.  Plot is pretty basic - boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love, plot twist 1, plague/war (plot twists 2-5), boy loses and regains girl and loses and regains girl, bad guys do bad things (big surprise - plot twists 6-12), everyone's happy, plot twist 13, plot from beginning of book is explained really quickly at the end.

All in all, I had high expectations for this book and was pretty disappointed when it turned into a pretty basic ""good vs. evil"" action/sex book.  He certainly didn't need to make it 1000 pages long if that's what his aim was..."

I bought World Without End because I read everything by Ken Follett.  When I saw how big it was 'over 1000 pages' I kept putting off reading it.  I finally decided to take the plunge.  This book was fantastic.  I couldn't get enough of the characters.  I cared about them, and loved some and hated others.  I never wanted the book to end."

I love it when a book is so good I find myself thinking about it when I'm not reading it. I love when a book is an easy read not because the content is frivalous, but the writing is fluid and well paced. I love books that have epic story lines and diverse characters. I love historical fiction that is well researched but not ""preachy"". As a relatively slow reader, I love being able to read 100+ pages in one go without batting an eye. I love this book because it provides all these things. If you're looking for a book with emotional depth and contemplative prose, move along. If you're looking to invest yourself in a long and thrilling tale, look no further. Rating: 5 out of 5 Stars Suggested With: An oversized chair and a tankard of ale. ;)"
643,"Chosen (House of Night, #3)",0312360304,"P.C. Cast, Kristin Cast",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"Okay, so after books 1 & 2 I had to read the third (and actually now just finished the 5th and newest in the series.) I really didn't expect to like the House of Night series as much as I liked the Twilight series. Although I'd still have to say I like Twilight better, the HON series has deffinently caught my attention and drawn me in (when I didn't want to like it innitally.) If you like Twilight you'll like this series - similar and yet totally different, you've just got to read it! I'd say you don't have to start with books one and two (because the author ""recaps"" at the beginning of each book,) but I'd recommend doing so.
The only problem is I feel like the heroine (Zoey,) has way too much guy drama - she likes/is involved with about three guys at any given time in the series. It also seems like she always attracts the ""hotest"" most desireable guys around her - amazing!"
643,"Chosen (House of Night, #3)",0312360304,"P.C. Cast, Kristin Cast",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"After finishing this book, i concluded with: 'Erik Night is too good for Zoey Redbird'. Like the other reviewers, the authors did repeat an awful lot of the previous two books. The story was very uneventful, my conclusion was that it filled 300 pages was because most of the information were things that were already mentioned in not one, but two of the previous books.     Also, I am in absolute no favor whatsoever toward Zoey. The entire book she claims that she hates 'sluts'(which is one of the reasons why she supposedly didn't like herself), but in the end, she is one herself.     This is most likely the worst vampire book I've ever read."

Taking place in the heart of New York City, it tells the story we all love in a whole new faith. One fabulous trait of this book is it follows the author's(alex Flinn's) well loved style of taking a perfectly fairytale-esk story with a chilling and violent secret that leads the characters to discover real life horrors in the most tragic and surprising manor possible.sadly, This book hasen't been followed by the best reviews, and you may be thinking after reading several other reviews that this book is simply a one-star-worthy copy of Beauty and the beast, and to say the least, you'd be excrutiatingly WRONG! Now, i can simply continue writing on and on about how wonderful this book is, but this is simply my opinion.So, i suggest above everything, to get a truly wise opinion on the book, READ IT FOR YOURSELF!!!"
645,"Beastly (Beastly, #1; Kendra Chronicles, #1)",0060874163,Alex Flinn,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Iambubbaq,"I'm a sucker for the tale of Beauty and the Beast. Disney's version being my favorite. This book however is also a great retelling. 

The story is set in modern day New York, where a spoiled and handsome high schooler by the name of Kyle Kingsbury just so happens to tick of a witch. It pretty much follows the basic pattern to any tale of Beauty and the Beast so I won't get into detail of the story other then that.

I just really appreciated the fresh first person perspective from the Beast's point of view. It was really great to see his emotions and thoughts throughout his transformation to a much kinder being. Also, his sarcastic comedical way of going about almost everything. When Lindy comes into the picture this plays a great role as well. Unlike most re-tellings Lindy is the most gorgeous girl and you see from his perspective all her faults and all the things he grows to love about here. I thought this worked very well.

Even though this is a typical love story and re-telling of Beauty and the Beast I think any individual man or women would in joy it. Its not overly feminine and is not overly sexist either. 

Great read. Recommended."
645,"Beastly (Beastly, #1; Kendra Chronicles, #1)",0060874163,Alex Flinn,Barnes and Noble,4.3,MelissaHalk,"Any reader who is a fan of Beauty and the Beast must read Beastly, by Alex Flinn. Beastly, is a modern day story of Beauty and the Beast. The beast is a high school boy who takes advantage all the great things he has. The character development was wonderful, the story's great symbolism is magnificent, and the principles of perfection are uplifting. Similar to the delicate scent of a faultless rose, Beastly will linger in the reader's mind long after the pages of the book have been closed.
Firstly, the character development is absolutely wonderful and brings to life a world of characters that together convey a believable civilization. Kyle Kingsbury has the looks, the money and the popularity. So what is he missing? He is missing everything that matters on the inside. He was cruel to anyone who did not meet his standards and put his feelings before anyone else's.  One cannot but hate Kyle at the start of the story. Even with his tragic flaw, he is still unlikeable. He is narcissistic and any reader cannot help but feel that Kyle dissevers his comeuppance of being a beast. Half way through the novel readers begin to sympathize, and wish Kyle to find a person to love him for his inner beauty which is actually transformed into a kind hearted person. Even Kendra, the witch who placed the spell on him, wishes the spell to be lifted because Kyle truly saw the error in his passed lifestyle.
Secondly, the stories symbolism is simple yet complex all at once. Must, if not all the symbolism conveyed throughout the novel is relatively similar to the original tale of Beauty and the Beast. The symbol of the white rose is not just the purity of life, but the precious meaning of it and how no matter what the price is it is still meaningful to a particular person or persons. The night Kyle is transformed he tries to kill himself. He mutilates his arm with intensions to die, but the second he turns away he is magical heeled with not a single scratch on him.  This symbolism builds to the idea that one cannot kill their inner identity. In order to change back he must change from within first.
Thirdly, Alex Flinn makes the reader question his or her views of perfection. When Kyle first meets Lindy he describes her as ugly with crooked teeth and assumes that she is socially awkward. Later on Lindy is Kyle's true love.  It seems almost perfect, she is beautiful on the inside and Kyle follows in love with her for her personality.  Lindy's red hair and freckles have Kyle question his own standers of beautiful perfection. Kyle names a rose brush after her and her awkward perfection. The tension of Kyle's unrequited love is taunting and then as the reader believes Lindy is beginning to love him in return Kyle has to let her go. He cannot bare the feeling of keeping her as a prisoner; he wants her to willingly stay. The feeling in the pit of every reader's stomach is grief. But perfection is found once again, love is found, and perfect happiness is reached.  
Like a perfect rose, Beastly lingers in the mind of reader's long after the pages of the book have been closed. The main character is believable and well developed. It was a pleasure to watch him dig deep inside himself to find love and hope in a girl who had always existed far below his radar. The symbolism is deeply insightful. The ideals of the boundaries of perfection are tested at great lengths. The book is well worth the read and will keep the reader turning pages compulsively until the story has en"
646,The Canterbury Tales,0140424385,"Geoffrey Chaucer, Nevill Coghill",Barnes and Noble,3.8,MattW,I got an advance copy of this and have read the first few tales -- what an amazing translation. It's accessible and will be perfect for classroom studies or just catching up on a classic.
646,The Canterbury Tales,0140424385,"Geoffrey Chaucer, Nevill Coghill",Barnes and Noble,3.8,theokester,"Writing a ""review"" of The Canterbury Tales is difficult, not because the book/collection isn't worthy of a review, but because it is so widely variant and has so many nuances to be discussed. 

So what do you say in a brief review of The Canterbury Tales? 

To start with, I would suggest you try reading it in the original Middle English. The language/spelling/pronunciation can be a problem, so be sure you get an edition that's glossed (unless you're proficient in Middle English). During the semester, I found a ""children's"" edition of the tales at my local library. It included Modern English ""translations"" of a couple of the tales along with some illustrations. It was kind of fun to read, but it lost some of the rhythm and drive of the tales by having them in a modern format. 

The writing is fun and clever (once you get through the 'translation' issues with the Middle English). For a common reference, it's like reading Shakespeare, only more archaic by a couple hundred years. The language of the narrative varies depending on the narrator of the particular prologue/tale, but with Chaucer at the helm behind the scenes, the writing is generally very good, descriptive, layered, humorous, inspiring, etc. (except for when he's trying to illustrate 'bad writing', and then it's good in that it's so bad). 

The messages presented are widely varied as well. The Knight's Tale was an intriguing tale of romance and chivalry with lots of courtly intrigue...but at times it felt a little dry. The Miller and the Reeve were hilarious tales and introduced me to a new (to me) genre in the fabliau. The Wife of Bath had an interesting prologue and a fun tale, again with a semi-romantic style and an interesting moral. The Nun's Priest gave us a fun little animal fable. The Prioress presented a strange little tale about miracles or anti-semitism or devout love or something else? 

Overall, I would definitely recommend having a copy of The Canterbury Tales on your shelf. Some tales are easier to read than others. Some tales are more fun while others are more thought provoking (as stated in one of the prologues, a tale has one of two purposes, to educate or to entertain...and there are examples of each). Once you get your teeth into the language (probably the biggest hurdle) I suspect you'll enjoy these."

The protagonist Eragon is a well rounded character that has matured through the books as has the author. Unlike infallible characters like Harry Potter, Eragon has weaknesses, and strengths. The writing is reminiscent of Tolkein without the unnecessarily verbose asides about trees, flowers, and sunsets. This series sits on my bookshelf in a prominent place as one of my favorite fantasy series.

649,1Q84,0307593312,"Haruki Murakami, Jay Rubin, Philip Gabriel",Barnes and Noble,4,Jeri82,"I previously had only read short stories by Haruki Murakami, so reading him in this longer form was amazing. Some authors can't seem to go between short and long forms so I had some trepidation. But this is beautifully surreal while still keeping his wonderful economy of language. (Which may also be a tribute toward the translators.) I loved every page and can heartily recommend it."
649,1Q84,0307593312,"Haruki Murakami, Jay Rubin, Philip Gabriel",Barnes and Noble,4,Cria-cow,"I read probably 800 of the 1,000+ pages of this book in the last few days. My brain hurts. 

Let's say 3 1/2 stars. The first two books are powerful; you can't stop reading them. The third book is a bit more of a slog (although I think I found it far less so than my esteemed colleagues in our book club). It suffers from, among other things, having been released as a trilogy originally in Japan but as one giant book in North America; book 3 is thus an awful lot of repetition and an awful lot of slogging through, sometimes, even the same words as the first two books. 

Mechanics aside, it's a fascinating story. The protagonists are drawn into a slightly alternate reality--at least, they think they are--and the book becomes an exploration of what's real and what isn't, even how time works (and doesn't). 

It isn't perfect. It's really long, and often feels like it didn't need to be. It gets repetitive. Often times, all but one of the viewpoint characters end up in less than interesting situations, and you push through those chapters longing for the story to continue again. 

But in the end, it all felt worth it, because the story was worth it. Even if my head hurts."

650,Uncle Tom's Cabin,1840224029,Harriet Beecher Stowe,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"I loved this book. I will admit that it wasn't an easy read. But I was determined to finish it anyway. It had so many valuable life lessons that I don't have the space or time to mention them all. I strongly recommend it for christians to read, because we do sometimes forget how to hold on to our faith, when times are bad. I laughed and cried, and I feel so much more enlightened now about faith and love. I hope I'll never forget the teachings in this book."
650,Uncle Tom's Cabin,1840224029,Harriet Beecher Stowe,Barnes and Noble,3.9,courtney_weaver,"Uncle Tom's cabin is a very touching story telling the life of a family of slaves. Uncle Tom is the heart of the story working on Mr. Shelbys farm. He has a wife and a son and he even has is own little cabin that Mr. Shelby has supplied him. Tom was happy there and the tought of escaping never crossed his mind. He believed that God put him there for a reason. 
Writen by Harriet Beecher Stowe, this touching story is unforgettable. The story sets in the south on a slave plantation were the slaves work for their owners and the thought of being sold to a different owner stays with them everyday.
Not only does this story talk about the story of time but it is filled with charecters from all walks of life ranging from the runnaway slaves tht tells the struggles they go through and all of the heartache they experiance when the two get seperated.
Not only do the slaves suffer but their family does as well. Tom has a son and for the most of his little life he won't understand why his dad has left.
For most of Tom's journey through this book he gets traded from owner to owner and finaly gets settled in with an abusive, angered and strict man. Tom still finds away to keep faith and believes that God will light the way. Plus he meets some odd charectors throughout the story like Topsy a daranged and clumsy little slave girl that finds fun in entertaining anyone who will watch.
I would recomend this book to everyone and anyone because it teaches you the morals of life and that no matter what always keep faith because Tom never lost hope and he found the light in the most dimmest moments because he knew that God was always on his side protecting him
This book is a must read because it has a lot of historical facts and it gives you a glimpse into the eyes of a different race and what they had to experience."
650,Uncle Tom's Cabin,1840224029,Harriet Beecher Stowe,Barnes and Noble,3.9,yearningtoread,"Uncle Tom lives in Kentucky under the kind Shelby family, where he has had the life of ease, even as a slave in America. He's treated with respect, both him and his family. He has helped work the Shelby's land for years. Tom loves the Lord, and serves Him all the days of his life. His heart is set on winning others to Jesus and serving the saved and unsaved. He is joyful. He has everything a slave could ask for. 

But Shelby has some debts to settle. Tom, the most valuable slave on the plantation, is sold, and sent with a trader named Haley to be sold. It is the beginning of one of the greatest adventures ever put to paper. It is an adventure of sorrow, broken hearts, and a love that is more redeeming than any human love. 


I was greatly impressed by this book. Before I was finished with it, I read in a curriculum that many writers and publishers were very critical of Stowe's work, that many did (and do) not like it. Even then I wasn't quite sure why, but at the end I was confused. How could anyone dislike this book? Even if the story is too sad for you - how can you not at least see the beauty of the characters and how Stowe formed each sentence? It was all careful, taking one step, one breath at a time. The book was like that. Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out. Methodical, like breathing. And what's the beauty of breathing? It keeps you alive without you even knowing it. In a sense, Uncle Tom's Cabin was like that. Every breath was perfect, I didn't even realize it, but it kept the story going in a way that I will never, ever forget. 

There isn't much else to say about this story...other than please, I beg you to read this book. I laughed, I cried my eyes out, I went numb with fear and hatred, I was captivated by the love of God. And Tom, the slave who is now free, will always be a hero."
651,The Phantom of the Opera,0060809248,"Gaston Leroux, Alexander Teixeira de Mattos",Barnes and Noble,4.7,Anonymous,"I thought Gaston Leroux proved himself an amazing author in this suspenseful novel. I enjoyed this book and could not put it down once i got into it. In fact, it only took me about two days. He did a great job combining suspense, mystery, and romance all into one book so both guys and girls can enjoy. There was never a slow moving part; it was always action pact in an edge of your seat type of anticipation. He did a good job using the literary element of symbolism as a base of the story. He did a good job portraying each character and giving them the perfect personalities for their roles. I was also impressed with how well thought through the story line was and how detailed he was of the characters and the opera house itself. Like i said i really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to any one who loves suspenseful and or romantic novels that are action packed and full of unexspected turns."
651,The Phantom of the Opera,0060809248,"Gaston Leroux, Alexander Teixeira de Mattos",Barnes and Noble,4.7,Anonymous,"The novel &ldquo;The Phantom of the Opera&rsquo; written by Gaston Leroux is one of the most unique books I have ever read. It tells the story of the infamous Opera Ghost who lives beneath the Parisian Opera House. To most, he is just a legend but to others- unfortunate and doomed others-he is a real human being named Erik. However, he soon falls in love with the beautiful Christine Daae and seeks to aid her in her pursuit of glory and perfection. However, Christine&rsquo;s lover Raoul soon catches on to what is happening and, because of his love for Christine, aims to do something about this meddlesome and dangerous Phantom. 
	One of the biggest themes of &lsquo;The Phantom of the Opera&rsquo; is that of appearances and how they deceive. The Phantom is hideous and his entire reputation is based on the fact that he is hideous. No one truly knows who he is and judges him on his disfigured face. However, when wearing his mask or when he is not even seen, he is not judged. Christine, in fact believes that he is someone that she can relate to and, quite possibly, love. Likewise, the rich and attractive benefactors of the Opera House are respected by everyone and loved by many. However, on the inside, these people are just as hideous as the Phantom.  They judge the Phantom and are ultimately the reason for his demise. Throughout the entire story, we, the audience, transform from judging based on the myths and descriptions of the Phantom to knowing who he is and why he is that way. Thus, in addition to receiving a gripping yarn, we also learn a valuable lesson.
	Like I have said, this is a curious and unique book. It most certainly deserves a place in history with a truly fascinating story and main character. However, in my opinion, the book is not very well written. It seems to stumble along and relies and how intriguing the story. In the end, the writing style was not enough to greatly hinder my enjoyment of the book but it kept from being the truly great book that it could have been.  Apart from the writing style, the book is really terrific. The story is fascinating and engaging from start to finish. The characters of the Phantom, Raoul and Christine Daae and their respective relationships are just so fascinating that they makes the entire book worth reading. One character, especially, stands out among the others. In my opinion, the mysterious &ldquo;Persian&rdquo; is even more interesting than Erik the Phantom. He is a mysterious man from Erik&rsquo;s past who is quite sympathetic against Erik but has to work with Raoul against him. To reveal any more would be a crime.
	While &lsquo;The Phantom of the Opera&rsquo; may be a &lsquo;great&rsquo; book, it is actually not all that good. It will never be used as a literary example of how books should be written. Gaston Leroux&rsquo;s novel is just good, pulpy fun and sometimes that&rsquo;s all you want in a book. For me, it was just enough."
651,The Phantom of the Opera,0060809248,"Gaston Leroux, Alexander Teixeira de Mattos",Barnes and Noble,4.7,songcatchers,"This gothic novel does a wonderful job with crossing genre lines. It mixes elements of romance, horror and mystery into a fantastic piece of fiction. We, the reader, travel from the very roof of the Paris Opera House down to the lair of the ""Angel of Music"" beneath that same house of music. The Phantom of the Opera contains an underground lake, a torture chamber and a graveyard. And yet this novel is fundamentally a love story. A heartbreaking one at that!This novel by Gaston Leroux has been adapted to the stage and film many times. It is considered to be a French classic of literature. It is very deserving."
652,"Definitely Dead (Sookie Stackhouse, #6)",0441014917,Charlaine Harris,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"I must say that I became addicted to this series after the first book  however, my love is waning. The books and relationships are predictable. Every book there is a new guy that falls head over heels in love with Sookie, and it's becoming tiresome. Charlaine never gives us closure on any of her relationships or flings. This means that Sookie is loved, wanted, and lusted after by all who have had her. So...what's the count now? There's Sam, Alceade, Bill, Eric, Quinn, and the newcomer that's bound to love her too in the next book. Enough already! I started reading this series because I liked Sookie's character, but I've come to dislike Sookie and her continuing need to have her ego stroked. I now read the books for Eric alone. I hope that Charlaine goes back and reads her own series so that she may be reminded of how independent and humble Sookie was in the beginning. If the series continues on its current path I'm afraid it will lose one of its followers."

He's been by her side all along but Charline keeps bringing in new guys. I hope the next book is better and Sookie starts to settle down with a man."
653,Blindness,0156007754,"Jos?? Saramago, Giovanni Pontiero",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Jessi-21,"I loved the premise of Blindness. It had a great flow to it, excellent character development (though highly unconventional), and a story that kept one guessing most of the way through.
Though the ending was somewhat predictable, some of the scenes completely off base on human reactions, and the action often simplistic, the story itself had a cohesiveness that keep me locked in the whole time. Some have described the story as if it were an interpretation of a painting, attributing many facets to it that were not obvious. Maybe I am just shallow, but though it was a great read, I would not rank it up there with ""War and Peace""!
I read the book in two sittings, and will do it again. That said, the style of writing best associated with an internet chat room, missing all writing conventions except periods for the end of a sentence, makes the book difficult to read. Though, as you become accustomed to the style it gets easier, it creates confusion as you often find yourself rereading parts to figure out who was speaking, and trying to decide if it was a thought or a spoken word. The minimum amount of paragraphs, even though action, conversations and thoughts among many people take place in one paragraph, make following the threads of the story difficult. Many have said that this was intentional, and maybe it was, but I fail to see how it would have hurt the story to follow normal writing rules. Unfortunately, the sequel ""Seeing"" is done the same way, and makes even less sense!
All that said, if you like apocalyptic science fiction with an intellectual bent, this is a great book to work your way through. It even has a slight feel of Asimov to it."
653,Blindness,0156007754,"Jos?? Saramago, Giovanni Pontiero",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"I'm actually surprised that everyone gave it such good reviews. The translation was awkward, which made it very hard to read. 


I also kept waiting for someone to be a little more self sufficient! They all walked around like sheep and did nothing to help themselves. They relied on the only sighted person in the story. It was frustrating!
They couldn't cook because there weren't any microwaves? Ahhhh...what did we do before microwaves? The whole book was like that! Sorry, I just was surprised at how weak it was. Good idea that fell flat.

But, what do I know, he won a nobel prize for it!"

It's not what I usually have in my pile of books to read but I heard a lady on NPR rave about how this was the only book she had read or would read more than one time and I thought that was a good recommendation.  It did make me think about a lot of things I would never have thought about which I suppose a good book will but it was pretty dark (no pun intended) and had a little to much of the gritty details for me.

This story was so realistic in many ways to my experiences and those of my friends (predominately boomers), as well as our adolescent and young adult kids. He really gets family ties and the effects of depression on relationships. I felt like I knew Patty. You feel like you are right there... watching or experiencing everything, especially the effects of 9/11 on everything (I live near DC and he gets everything right about it). I would read him again and again. Recommend for book clubs."

Very boring, self serving story about a not so normal family.  I would not reccomend this to anyone, sorry Oprah.  If you are looking for a good read, try Unconditional.  It is well written story, with well developed characters.  The plot twist and ending will certainly surprise you, and I guarantee that you wont put it down until you reach the end."
654,Freedom,0374158460,Jonathan Franzen,Barnes and Noble,3.2,SHARON39,"FREEDOM is the story of our time, our concerns. Beautifully written, this amazing novel has a lot of entertaining satire, witty metaphors, deep insights, and a smattering of politics, (all sides). He works in what makes people tick, self-awareness and growth.human nature. The baby boomer generation, in search of the almighty self-gratification, apparently, have destroyed a great deal of the world's natural resources with no thought at all of the consequences. Strong ideas and obsessions shape people so much so that they can ruin their lives and others. Political prejudices prevent people from making friends and being genuine. Perception blinds the world's people to the world as it really is. This is a very human, realistic, painfully so, story of a couple and their friends that is totally believable, as if a true life biography. There is no Fairy Tale here. Interestingly thought-provoking! Isn't it a shame that we all can't just BE NICE? Why does that have to be so hard? Respect? Why does that have to be so hard? I recommend this to the reader who has an open mind and is capable of understanding the author's intention."

656,"I'd Tell You I Love You, But Then I'd Have to Kill You (Gallagher Girls, #1)",1423100034,Ally Carter,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Helloo,"I remember when I'd Tell You I Love You But Then I'd Have to Kill you first came out. Picked it up, sounded interesting, but I hate first character narrators who sound too...teenagery. I've had my experiences with them and I wasn't willing to risk my cash on another one. So now, four years later I picked up Heist Society--by Ally Carter, same author of Gallegher Girls series and madly fell in love with her story telling skills. Gallagher Girls series is quite the ride and I'm glad I--twenty years old--picked it up and finally read it. I won't give away anything but each book is full of humor and action. But you can tell that through out the years she started to grasp the whole feel for great story telling--not that the first two books where horrible. Far from it, but the last two books--especially the last one (Only the Good Spy Young) certainly were a crazy ride full of emotion and character development.

 The first two books had fun humor and introductions to the spy world and what it had to offer and the troubles and duties that came along with it. But they lacked the action, intensity and climatic story that the last two books where equipped with. Either way, I didn't feel like sticking fork in my eye while reading Cam's narrative. Very fluid and fun and simple. As the story progresses and she faces more danger--without her teachers plannings--she grows more mature and aware of what's out there. What she'll have to face one day. 

If you're looking for a series or just a good fun book, then these books are the right choice. Don't let the long--maybe a tad cheesy (I kinda like it :] ) title fool you. Cam and her gang will steal your friendship and Zach (sigh) will steal your heart. Because they're spies. And thats what they do."

657,The White Tiger,1416562591,Aravind Adiga,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Guest,"Aravind Basu's brilliant debut is a tale of suspense and questionable morality which takes you on an unexpected journey into the heart of India through Balram Halwal aka 'The White Tiger'.Born in the fictional village of Laxmangarh, near the famous village of Bodh Gaya, where Buddha attained enlightenment, Halwal is the son of a rickshaw puller. After seeing his father die a painful death, neglected by the hospital authorities, he is forced to drop out of school and ends up working in a tea shop wiping tables. All he dreams of is escape. He manages to find his way out of the dreaded tea shop when a rich village landlord hires him as a chauffeur for his son who has returned from the United States. Things change rapidly for Halwal when he has to move to the Indian capital New Delhi with his new master. Here he comes face to face with the two Indias: As Adiga aptly puts it: 'The dreams of the rich, and the dreams of the poor - they never overlap, do they? See, the poor dream all their lives of getting enough to eat and looking like the rich. And what do the rich dream of? Losing weight and looking like the poor.' Living in a big city with bright lights on the one hand and teeming poverty on the other, Halwal starts questioning many things he has taken for granted while growing up in his small village. Things get murky when his master attempts to frame him for an accidental murder committed by his wife. Halwal is forced to question his undying loyalty. His awakening eventually turns him into a successful entrepreneur. But does the road to success justify spilling blood? Read this riveting page-turned, written in epistolary form, to find out."
657,The White Tiger,1416562591,Aravind Adiga,Barnes and Noble,3.8,TrainTravelReader,"This was a book that was selected by my book club, not one that I would have chosen to read on my own. The author's intent was to bring to light some of the atrocities that seems to still exist today about life in India. The storytelling is a bit slow for my taste, so I found myself easily distracted as I tried to read this book on my train commute. The main character is not very likable, and the overall story does not leave you feeling satisfied. This is not a book I enjoyed reading, and I would not recommend it to others."
657,The White Tiger,1416562591,Aravind Adiga,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Guest,"Ripped from the dark heart of modern-day India, comes debut novelist Aravind Adiga, a hip Gunga Din for the millennium, blowing a hot, Ornette Coleman riff of a novel, from the top of a dirty golden dome, that is at once visceral, witty, irreverent, bloody, and untimately satisfying.    By the first few pages of his book, 'The White Tiger,' the reader quickly forgets about finding a lyrical, fragrant India, similar to the novels of M.M. Kaye, and Vikram Seth. This is a down and dirty India, much like it's mother of a river, the Ganges. The story as put down by it's narrator, the complex, Balram Halwai, who has risen from desperate poverty, to become a chauffer for two rich Poleranians, rails against India's class system and corruption, with a searing and damning sarcasm.    Halwai's haunting trumpet blast of a literary voice lingers with the reader long after the final page, but will India be ready for his next book?    I know I will. This is one hell-of-a read."
658,The Corrections,1841156736,Jonathan Franzen,Barnes and Noble,3.3,Lisa_RR_H,"I suppose it's a reflection of my bourgeois middlebrow tastes that I didn't just hate this book but thought it badly written--Pulitzer Prize Finalist or not. It's one of those novels with an omniscient narrative with lots of Post-Modernist Stylistic Touches that Examines The Human Condition(tm)--in other words a pretentious, depressing work with unlikeable characters and turgid prose. The kind of book where paragraphs can go on for more than a page and single sentences, kept aloft with slashes, parenthesis, colons and semi-colons almost as long. (See, page 11, 17.) One with irritating affectations like referring to a fictitious school as ""D-- College."" (God, just make up a name already.)

Every once in a while I did think there were flashes of brilliance (which is why it gets more than one star). Such as how in Part One, Enid and Alfred, an elderly Midwestern couple, are characterized through their possessions. Or in Part Two how their son Chip translates the subtext of his mother's quizzing of his girlfriend.

However, not even the satiric tones could make Chip's self-absorbed academic musings bearable--maybe Franzen did that too well--I had flashbacks to the worst of my politically correct college professors. Franzen's depiction of Yuppiehood in New York City wasn't any more appealing. (And I say that as a proud native New Yorker who usually loves to see my city depicted.) I lasted till the end of the second part at page 134 because I wanted to give such a raved-about book a fair shot. By then I knew there was no way I was going to last all the way to the end at page 566 without taking it out on some innocent bystander."
658,The Corrections,1841156736,Jonathan Franzen,Barnes and Noble,3.3,harstan,"Alfred Lambert was the patriarch and the disciplinarian of a family of five.  However, he now suffers ignobly from Parkinson's disease and has plenty of elder care needs.  His spouse Enid wants to remain loyal to her long time mate and provider, or at least her memory of him.  However, she feels more like a hostage to his sickness though choosing to ignore his illness and dream about anything more uplifting to care about.       Their only daughter Denise begins a job in a hip bistro in Philadelphia.  However, she puts her work in jeopardy when she begins an affair with her boss¿ spouse.  The oldest son Gary struggles with depression.  With the help of his wife he steps closer to the abyss of a breakdown.  The youngest son Chip loses his academic job due to a student.  He almost loses his life next on some fraudulent scheme in Europe.  The Lambert brood appears all ready to self-destruct and yet each one keeps alive in their heart a glimmer of hope for a better future.      THE CORRECTIONS is a humorous yet extremely serious look at an American family against a backdrop of the world scene.  The story line is bitter, melancholy, and yet somehow manages to be optimistic as well.  Each member of the Lambert brood is a genuine individual struggling to cope with life. Though harsh in many respects, humor keeps the novel from becoming too maudlin.  Jonathan Franzen, who writes a novel every decade or so, shows why he is one of the best authors with this must read classic look at the American way of life.    Harriet Klausner"
658,The Corrections,1841156736,Jonathan Franzen,Barnes and Noble,3.3,Guest,"Ever since Jonathan Franzen spoke out against his book being chosen as an Oprah Book Club Selection, his rating has dropped at an unbelievable rate.  Wonder why???  I have been around and read many books in my life and I am 100% serious when I say that you can without a doubt ignore any review below two stars, because it probably came from an angry Oprah fan.  This book is incredible!!!  It has wonderful writing, the most in-depth characters I've ever had the pleasure to read about, very witty sarcasm, and incredible references to some very obscure but profound events in history.  I apologize to anyone offended, but I think that this book was a bad selection for Oprah's club, because it is well beyond what her average viewer wants or understands.  It deserved the National Book Award and should go down as one of the best books of the last ten years."

As if his eloquence in speech wasn't enough, the man knows how to lay down some seriously beautiful words on paper. And what often struck me as campaign rhetoric before (like his ideas about ""change"" and ""hope""), I now think he honestly believes in, after reading this very frank memoir. According to him, affecting ""change"" is also a very personal journey, in which he's constantly trying to find a society in which someone like him can truly belong. Though he harbors similiar doubts about what it means to be a black man in America like Ellison and Wright, Obama never goes down Invisible Man or Bigger territory. He learns to accept all aspects of his experience, from his childhood overseas to his at-times frustrating run as a community organizer in Chicago to a final enlightening and deeply moving moment in front of his father's grave in Africa.Obama's search for identity (and the perspectives he's gained through his ties to Indonesia and Kenya) will speak to anyone who straddles more than one culture - whether through race, upbringing, or simply from living on other shores."

The research he has done for this book makes it a realistic, and an excellent story for any type or age of reader.  The realism and suspense in a dangerous situation earn this book its five star rating."
660,Congo,0060541830,Michael Crichton,Barnes and Noble,4,Carlosdogsmynombre,"This book has been one of the most suspenseful, interesting, and exiting books I have read so far. I had to choose a book from a list for an English presentation, and when I read Congo's summary I knew this book would not be boring. And in fact I was right. From the very start of this book I was hooked, when the eight man expedition team suddenly died by a mysterious jungle killer. When I read this I just flipped through the pages just to find out some answers. I literally couldn't put down this novel. Also when Michael Crichton added in another story about finding the lost city of Zinj that caught my attention even more. The way Crichton was able to develop Congo's story line amazed me. I feel that his style of writing will interest many readers of all different ages. 
            The perfect use of detail added to this book too. It seemed like the author knew the right spots to add in description. For me, I enjoyed the parts were he described the Congo rain forest. For example, when the new team from ETRS steppes foot into the jungle, Crichton did a good job of explain the scenery. I really felt like I was one of those explorers trekking through the forest, in search of my fellow team member and the lost city.

            By far the most aspect of this book I enjoyed was the feeling of adventure and suspense. You couldn't even tell what going to happen next. Every story that Karen and her crew faced, was a fascinating. The book did a good job of keeping the reader on their feet. This is why Congo caught my attention as one of my most favorite books I have read so far."

The ETC group is off in a race against similar rival companies.
	
	Michael Crichton creates an action packed story with danger at every turn of a page.  Crichton creates a novel that is exciting and thrilling.  I overall found the book very interesting, but I also found it a little dull at some times when they discussed the company."

I normally am not a fan of the short story, as it usually lacks the depth that comes with getting to know characters over the course of a longer novel. However, I must say Lahiri manages to capture her readers' feelings and captivates their senses through her short stories in very much the same way she does in The Namesake. Her short stories may give those of us who aren't fans of this style of writing a new appreciation of the art that of luring & engaging readers over the course of only a few pages. This marvelous collection of short stories makes you forget this is Lahiri's very first work!"

In addition, Lahiri's writing style beautifully weaves all these characters into a common journey of self identity and preservation of culture."
662,Interpreter of Maladies,0618101365,Jhumpa Lahiri,Barnes and Noble,4.2,KatyH821,"I read this book for a book club and it instantly became one of my favorites!  While the tone may be a tad bit depressing at times, the book overall shines as a true picture of humanity.  As a historian, I will admit I have not studied Indian culture and this book has inspired me to do just that.  It beautifully depicts Indian culture in America and India.

Each of the short stories depicts vastly different situations and are written from the perspective of young and old, male and female.  Sometimes we see the lives of these Indian cultures from those living them, other times from outside observers.  No matter who is telling us the story, we always get a unique and touching picture into the character's lives."
663,A People's History of the United States,0060838655,Howard Zinn,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Guest,"Written with the extensive use of primary quotes allowing the reader to experience American history from the perspective of those who lived it, 'A People¿s History...' is one of the best books on American history that I have read. Zinn¿s use of language makes it exciting to read and easy to side with the oppressed groups of people throughout history. Zinn tells the story from the perspective of the underdog, which is a nice break from the normal history of the conqueror. Those who criticize the book as ¿socialist¿ need to open their minds and realize that the sugar-coated version of American history that they received during primary and secondary school was inaccurate and biased towards the status quo. Of course this is only one book, but one that is absolutely necessary to read for anyone who truly wants to understand our nation¿s past."
663,A People's History of the United States,0060838655,Howard Zinn,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Guest,"I'll be the first to admit that no history book offers up 'the straight facts' as our civics teachers of old would like us to believe. Books are written to educate, to entertain, and above all - thanks to publishing houses - to sell. Professor Zinn's work has managed and (with this new edition) hopefully will continue to manage to be different from the majority of history texts in the fact that it does all three of these things spectacularly well. While some readers will claim that there is a strong anti-capitalist bias, there is no denying that Professor Zinn has done his research and consequently presents a compellingly fresh view of the evolution of the United States of America.     If you are offended by the idea that the founders of our great nation had more in mind than noble speeches of revolution and a burning desire for an untaxed cup of tea, then by all means, curl up by the fire with a text that will convince you George Washington never told a lie. If, however, you can accept the idea that there might be more to the story, Professor Zinn's book is an excellent place to start."
663,A People's History of the United States,0060838655,Howard Zinn,Barnes and Noble,3.8,forkeh,"This is the text used in my current college U.S. History class; I read it cover to cover before the class started.It really is a well researched and captivating read. Very informative, yet intertaining.This book has a bad wrap as being ""socialist"" and ""antigovernment"" and that may be true, however when one looks at the history of our governmental crimes and downfall, it's impossible to write anything other and a cold, clinical text without ""slamming"" the goverment. I also feel the need to point out that much of our history centers around socialist movements so it's really no surprize the socialist tone of the book.Over all, Zinn is very clear about the spin, if you can even call it that, of the book straight from the title! The book is titles ""A People's History Of The United States."" This is a text of the have-nots. A historical book from the view of the nonaristocratic and nonpolitical society. Those of you who feel the need to put down the book because of it's perspective should ask yourselves. Am I being fair? Is Zinn really telling tails an wrongly slamming the government? Or is he telling history from a perspective which, while everyone may not understand/enjoy, is in fact historically correct and insitefull to the lives of those who were disadvantaged? In conclusion, it's a great book that everyone should take the opportunity to read. Though I also think, because of it's perspective, it is innappropriate to base one's entire historical education/opinion on."

664,Breakfast at Tiffany's,0679745653,Truman Capote,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Smiler69 on LibraryThing,"I discovered Breakfast at Tiffany's as a small child, when I saw the movie on television. Much later, I read somewhere that Truman Capote had been unhappy with the choice of Hepburn to play Holly Golightly and also that the movie was a tame version of the much grittier novel. While I thought the different tone of the novel was interesting, and I actually liked the grittier bits, it didn't especially appeal to me as a whole. I think this might be because I've seen the movie countless times and have always been enamoured with Audrey Hepburn, who became my icon when I discovered her first in that role when I was much too young to catch on to what it was exactly that Holly was doing with those ugly rich old men. And the movie is undeniably beautiful and fun in so many ways that I had a hard time stopping myself from making comparisons when reading the book. This is definitely a case where I would probably have enjoyed the book much more for it's own sake had I read it before I became such a big fan of the movie. But then, I'm not sure I would have been able to appreciate Truman Capote writing all that much before the age of 5 either..."

It begins in the future with the U.S. still at war with terror. The military is secretly attempting to bioengineer the 'perfect' soldier using death row inmates that no one will notice has gone missing. The inmates infected with the bioengineered virus escape and wreak havoc throughout the U.S. Ironically the Gulf of Mexico is referrenced as being so thick with oil that you could walk across it without getting wet. I can't imagine anyone not loving this book. I recommend it to everyone."
665,"The Passage (The Passage, #1)",0345504968,Justin Cronin,Barnes and Noble,4,TomeLover,"At 766 pages, The Passage, at first glance, can appear to be quite the undertaking.  Don't let the length of this book scare you away.  By page 25, you'll be unable to put it down, but wanting to at the same time, just so you can tell everyone how much you love this book.  

I could compare this to The Stand, The Book of Eli, I am Legend, 28 Days Later, and countless other books and movies, but I prefer to review it as it is meant to be read: a solitary work.  I won't give anything away, I hate ""reviews"" that are actually plot synopsis and spoilers.  This is a post-apocalyptic journey that is rewarding to the end and will have you contemplating the story for days and days after you've read the last word.

There were a few slow spots, as expected in a book that spans a century, but they weren't cumbersome, and you can easily navigate through to the next nail-biting bit.

I absolutely loved this book.  The story and writing style are perfect for me.  If you like books that tie up every loose end and present you with a pretty little package when you've finished reading, this is not the book for you.  If you prefer to let your imagination take flight, to leave your world behind, plunging into a fictional escape, then you will thoroughly enjoy this novel."
665,"The Passage (The Passage, #1)",0345504968,Justin Cronin,Barnes and Noble,4,Stonemaiden,"In the beginning, I loved this book.  Midway...a little less and the end...not so much.
For 640 pages I expect a bit of conclusion, parts of this book felt like a task.  It got long winded at times and gave me details that did not add or enhance the story, but seemed more for bulk.

In the beginning the characters are well developed and interesting, the characters become less the later they are introduced.  The story implies a mystery that you will be informed of and many of these things are never explained.

I like series reading as well as anyone, but I expect each book to have a point and be a complete story.  I do not like it when it feels as though you stretch one book to a possible 12, with no warning and a feeling of incompleteness.

The plot has great potential and lots of creativity, however it was not as well developed as I hoped and thought it would be based on the beginning of the book."
666,Anansi Boys,0060515198,Neil Gaiman,Barnes and Noble,4.3,jpquibrera,"Neil Gaiman delivers a resplandescent book that talks about pretty much everything. What I loved about this book was the fact that when you start reading it you think it's just an urban kind of story (the only thing the back cover says is that Charlie's father dies and he was supposed to be a God), and the more you read the more you discover what the story is about. It is fascinating: it's a wild, deep, touching story about magic, love, life, and everything you want to read about. Who would I recommend this book to? ANYONE! This book really is perfect, and if you haven't read it you're already missing a part of your heart. Trust me: ""Anansi Boys"" isn't at all what it seems - it's much, much more, and it changed my life. Neil Gaiman is now one of my favorite writers, his writing is so... gobsmackingly good! By the way, this book is so hilariously sarcastic sometimes that, when I was reading it at school, my teachers and classmates often asked me ""are you actually laughing because of a book?"", since I couldn't stop chortling and sometimes my laughs interrupted the teacher's lecture. It's just amazing. READ IT please. There's no alternative here: if you see ""Anansi Boys"" by Neil Gaiman, you BUY IT and you START READING as soon as possible.

This is far less dark than that book.  The lead character is called ""Fat Charlie"" even though he is not fat.  Frankly, that got to be annoying for me, but that's about the only negative criticism I would lay on the book.  The story does weave in and out of the supernatural dream-like world that was in evidence in American Gods, and for me those sections were a bit tedious at times, but it was part of the flavor of the book and again not nearly as ominous as in the earlier book. If you enjoyed American Gods, you will enjoy Anansi Boys, quite possibly even more."

This book teaches us to do go out there and try things we are not used to.And if we don't get it right the first time there is always a second chance and so on.And that we shouldn't miss out on opportunities even though they don't seem like that big of a deal.

I relate to this character more than I have to any other character, because I have missed out on a lot of adventures myself. From not going to parties or having boyfriends, but what I loved about this character is she couldn't ride and bike and I'm ashamed to admitted it, but I don't know how either!After one scratch on the knee I was done...But maybe I'll give another try, because it's never too late."

She always thought that her parents didn't have time to deal with her. Her mom is focused all on schoolwork, and makes sure that Auden always has the best grades. Her dad only cares about work and himself. The two differences in her parents caused a divorce, which Auden pretends she does not care about. Auden also never had any real friends. This all changes when she goes to visit her dad and his new wife and baby in a small beach town the summer before college. She finds a new job, new friends, and a romance. One of her new friends, Maggie, amazes Auden by how she is completely her own person. Also, Eli, a former bike star who was in an accident, helps Auden get back her childhood and do everything that she never could.
   This book has a very unique story. The characters are realistic and interesting. The setting is beautiful and has a warm feel to it. Also, the book has a specific plot and soulution. Definitely a teenage story. The only problem with this book is that the story line is very prdictable. Even though the story is unique, the reader is never very surprised.

668,Everything I Never Told You,159420571X,Celeste Ng,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"I have no idea why this book would get bad reviews on Barnes and Noble. I chose to read this story after discovering that it had been named Amazon's Best Book of 2014 and it had a four star rating on Amazon. I am glad I read it. From beginning to end, this novel captured me. It is a raw and gripping account of a tragic story that we can all learn from. Do not be fooled by poor reviews on BN... this is a very good story that will entrap you from the beginning and will not let you down in the end."
668,Everything I Never Told You,159420571X,Celeste Ng,Barnes and Noble,3.9,The_Book_Wheel_Blog,"One of three children born to interracial parents, Lydia was clearly the favorite. She was obedient, disciplined, talented, and never caused her parents to worry. When she goes missing and is subsequently found dead, it goes without saying that her parents were truly shocked. It is upon her disappearance that Everything I Never Told You by Celeste Ng begins, and what follows is a stunning portrait of family obligation, sibling rivalry, marriage, growing up, and societal norms.




In the wake of Lydia&rsquo;s death, each member of her family copes differently. Her mom laments the loss of Lydia&rsquo;s future while regretting her own decisions, her dad seeks solace in unlikely places, and her brother struggles with what he knows about the neighborhood bad boy. Only Lydia&rsquo;s younger sister has the presence of mind to see the facts for what they really are, but her role in the family prevents her from being outspoken about it. As each member of the family orbits around each other (and not discussing what they know), they give the reader a glimpse into a life that is less picture-perfect than it seems at first.




Although Everything I Never Told You is centered around Lydia&rsquo;s death, it is ultimately a complex story that incorporates racial tensions, academic pressures, and a precarious family dynamic based on regret and hope. Each family member is harboring secrets and battling inner demons, culminating in a story that is both poignant and realistic. If you&rsquo;re looking for a book that could easily mirror reality in the late 1970&prime;s, then this is the one for you.

671,"The Mysterious Affair at Styles (Hercule Poirot, #1)",0646418432,"Agatha Christie, ???????????? ??????????",Barnes and Noble,4.3,theokester on LibraryThing,"I'd read some Agatha Christie before but this was my first foray into the adventures of Hercule Poirot.  In many ways this novel felt like a very typical murder mystery book.  But as I stepped back to think about it, I was pleased by the elegance and the way the book was put together.In this particular book, Poirot is retired and living in England...I'm not sure how typical this is as compared with the later Poirot novels but I suspect they continue in the same vein.  Whatever the case, I enjoyed having this book set in England as it provided familiar settings and customs for the mystery.The story (and the murder) was presented through the narrative of Hastings, a guest at the stately home where the murder took place.  In this regards, our narrator existed in familiar relation to Poirot...it reminded me of the Holmes/Watson setup.  However, in this case, I felt like Hastings was a little less helpful to Poirot than Watson is to Holmes.  Perhaps this is just because it's Poirot's first novel and later on his assistants are more competent in deduction...or perhaps it's a conscious choice and done to make Poirot seem all the more brilliant.I only have vague memories of the other books I read by Christie and those memories were mostly that her style and structure sometimes felt repetitive.  That said, I really enjoyed this book.  Perhaps it's because I haven't read anything by her for a while and thus didn't notice the repetition.  Or perhaps the Poirot series is a fresher experience.  Whatever the case, it was a fun read.I had very few qualms about the book.  The largest problem I had was the amazing leaps of deduction that felt a little more far fetched than in other books, but were still believable enough.  Overall I felt that the mystery, the plot, the writing and the structure of this book was very elegant and engaging.Mystery fans should give Poirot a try if they haven't already.  And if you're just embarking into the world of Poirot, you may as well start with his first adventure here in Styles.****4 out of 5 stars"

672,"Murder on the Orient Express (Hercule Poirot, #10)",0425200450,Agatha Christie,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Fabio-De-Sanchez,"If your not looking for a book full of suspense and don't want to try to solve a crime as it unfolds beneath your nose than don't bother reading Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Christie. This is a mystery crime book that had multiple suspects, maybe one or more murderers, and one victim. The lesson to learn from this story is that maybe the people you trust aren't that trustworthy or don't try to run away from your problems and face them.

	While Belgium detective Hercule Poirot is on his way to Paris in an express train an American passenger onboard is stabbed multiple times. Not until daybreak the next day is he found lying dead stiff on the floor of his room. With the window open to the cold white snow outside and the door locked and chained from the inside is when the exciting mystery begins to be told like a movie in your head. There are multiple clues that you might want to take note of so you can try solving this exciting mystery on your own. Every one of the thirteen passengers should be looked at as suspects so you can prepare matching the clues with each one.

	Herclule Poirot is the detective that the author puts in the story to feed you the clues on the crime and help you solve the mystery. Mr. Rachet (fake name) is the poor guy that gets killed. Later you find out his real name. He is the character that makes the story possible but isn't much in keeping the story stay alive and exciting.

	Agatha Christie doesn't use any special types of writing styles. She just starts at a begging and adds events and clues throughout the book in real time story telling. I'm not saying its bad because its not. Christie has a natural story telling way of writing. The story is smooth and flows with greater excitement from time to time. For example: every time detective Poirot is questioning someone, somehow Christie makes it exciting to now what the other characters involvement in this crime were. I can't explain exactly what she does, just that is written well. She does a great job on making you suspect some people and not expect others at all. Every character has an interesting personality that is to be paid close attention to.
	
	This mysterious crime story is written in a first person view of Hercule Poirot. It was the best choice for Agatha Christie to make for the point of view for this story because the information we gather is only limited to the knowledge of the detective Hercule Poirot. I never thought of reading a mystery book before but now because of Christie I think I am going to get into them. I usually read science fiction novels like Enders Game and The Andromeda Strain, which are some of my favorite books. I would have to say that Agatha Christie did exceptionally well on this book with the storyline and extremely different personalities for each individual person on the train. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys mystery books and is looking for an exciting suspenseful read."

I have read lots of books from the perspective of other cultures, but this is the first I've read by a non-American black in America.  I was amazed at the differences she noted between the Nigerian culture and the US culture in terms of how she felt as a black person.

Not only is this a compelling story of love and romance, but it's pages are full of suspense that keeps you reading on until the very end. Patterson tells the story of a young woman named Katie who finds herself deeply in love with a man named Matt.  Everything is going great for the two of them when out of the blue Matt ends their two-year relationship without even explaining himself.  Katie is given an old diary from Matt, which he uses to explain his poor actions. As Katie reads through the pages she discovers many of Matt's hidden secrets, which includes a wife, and son Katie never knew about.  After finishing the dairy Katie realizes she had been wrong for assuming the worst out of Matt and she finds their relationship has grown even stronger after reading this diary.  This story had very few weak points except for the occasional sad moments.  I highly recommend this book to any audience, male or female, who is in the mood for a great read and has time to sit and read.  Once you start this book you won't be able to put it down."

675,Firestarter,0451167805,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.2,LookingCalifornia,"It's hard to sum up how great this book is in just one short review, but I'll try. A paranormal thriller/horror is exactly the kind of story that King has been made famous for and I believe Firestarter is his best. I like many King books, but this one has an edge. It's not just a story about a little girl with pyrokinesis; it's a startling tale about the government and the lengths they'll go to in order to control the people. This book has great flashbacks and descriptions that really suck the reader in. There is a realistic feeling about the story, despite the paranormal theme. Just imagine what the government would do if they found a child who could start fires and explosions."
675,Firestarter,0451167805,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Erincolleen,"... the ebook is full of distracting typos, and obviously poorly digitized. For instance, one character named Al appears as A1. Confusing since he is connected to an ""A-one-A"" priority mission. Often ""-rn"" is written as ""-m"" or ""cl-"" is written as ""d-"", turning modern into modem and clang into dang, etc. It's very disappointing and just seems unprofessional.   

I'm an avid King fan; this is one of his classics, and a great read in itself. However, I can't recommend that other ""Faithful Readers"" spend their money here. Opt for the paperback or a different ebook version instead."

They're all rambling on and on about the release date and how much they have loved the previous books. Annoying.

Having said that:

I'm DONE. I just finished this book and I'm SO unbelievably done with these authors who drag these stories on and on from book to book - for what?! I'm assuming to turn more of a profit?! 

This book was pointless. For the vast majority of the book... NOTHING HAPPENS. You have the same repetitive blah blah over and over of sex and the same thoughts of love and healing and NEED NEED NEED... interspersed with random hints of a storyline that never seemed to go anywhere. Then BOOM thirty freaking pages before the book ends, suddenly she starts piling on tons of cliffhangers... complete with a little page at the end telling you that the story isn't over and to wait for the next book. 

Yeah. Not buying it. Sorry, lady. You've already conned me out of almost $30 for LESS than one freaking story! I'm getting off the crazy train and finding another author who isn't just out to make a buck."

I'll break it down for you if you don't want to spend 10 dollars:

Blah blah... I love you Gideon.  Blah blah blah...I can't live without you Eva.  Blah blah...Gideon's so hot.  Blah blah...Eva you're beautiful.  Blah blah...I can't live without you.    Oh look... it's Corrine trying to get into Gideon's pants.  Oh hey... It's Brett trying to get into Eva's panties.  And look Gideon is all about Eva, and Eva is still uncertain of everything...no really?  So much of the dialogue could have been left out...it was the same crap over and over.  The plot and series could have been wrapped up nicely if she really wanted to give the readers what they wanted.  Instead we get a lot of the same old.  The cast of characters still acting like idiots.  No one learning their lesson, no one letting go.  They're annoying background noise; especially Megumi...do we really care? No.  I can't even say there is a real plot here.  It's little pieces and nothing earth shattering.  At the end we aren't even left with a cliff hanger....it just ends with no rhyme or reason leaving the reader feeling like they've been ripped off.  Your readers are pissed off Sylvia."

Pre-ordered in August of 2012 ... yeah, that's right ... that's just how much I liked the first two books in this TRILOGY.  As everyone is painfully aware now, the release date changed so many times I lost count.  Then I get emails and texts this morning from friends who stayed up all night reading EWY and were hopping mad not only about the ending and lack of real progression in the story, BUT also the fact that this is no longer a trilogy--2 more books planned.  I wonder if it'll even end there?  So, I hopped online and checked it out for myself.  I was truly stunned by all of the 1 star reviews for this book considering how highly anticipated it was by fans and how hyped it was by its author and others.  It was at that point that I decided, &quot;I'm done with this.&quot;  I'm done being jerked around to the tune of $9.99 a book (EBOOK for crying out loud--no trees killed!) only to find out that the author is going to keep milking my wallet instead of finishing the story as promised.  Then, I did something I have NEVER done before with any book ... I asked for a refund.  I am no longer playing this game.  There are far too many authors out there that respect their fans enough not to lead them on in this manner.  The fans of Eva and Gideon deserved better."

I bought this while travelling in Dublin and was impressed with every line. This is a must read for anyone who is serious about running or understanding runners.

This surprised me because not only am I not a runner, I rarely am inspired to read a book all the way to the end.  After hearing an interview with the author on the radio, I felt that I had to give this book a try.  I am glad that I did and I am telling just about everyone I know that they should, too.  The main story, the people and their stories , and the theories proposed, were all fascinating.  It was an enjoyable read that I wanted to continue after the last page.  Satisfying in many ways."

With Born to Run, my appetite for knowledge of their running prowess has been kicked into overdrive.

In Born to Run, McDougall weaves a Tolstoy-esque cast of characters, from running icons like Bill Bowerman to a virtually unknown and enigmatic gringo named Micah True, aka Caballo Blanco.

Upon receiving this book, I was a bit wary of the pitfalls that many books of this type can fall into, yet somehow McDougall weaves a story of epic proportions while still filling your mind with the truly simple science behind why barefoot is better. Not only does McDougall come to this realization because of his extensive research, but by putting into practice all the techniques that he learns along the way.

Every time I put this book down, I couldn't help but want to pick it up again, if only for one more page. The real joy and pleasure of this book, which is exactly the overriding message that lies within, is the joy of running that we have somehow managed to lose. Born to Run, through the wonderful words of Christopher McDougall made me want to put down this masterpiece only to go outside to run, like the Tarahumara, with a smile on my face"

680,Think and Grow Rich: The Landmark Bestseller - Now Revised and Updated for the 21st Century,1585424331,Napoleon Hill,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"In 1968, I was in the Seattle Airport waiting to go to Alaska to work in the oil field.  I was 21 year old, had two children in Texas.  I had a high school education, which is still the only formal education me or my wife have every received.  I was broke and my only prospects were working in the oil field the rest of my life.  I bought two books that day that changed my life.  Think and Grow Rich; and How to Win Friends and Influence People.  Over the next year working in weather down to 70 below zero my life changed from the information I received from these two books.  I was no longer on a road to nowhere.  I had a goal.  We goal now was to have a well round life and become a millionaire.  
I am 62 years old now.    My Net Worth is around 10 million dollars. I am currently an investor.  I owe three companies that others run for me.  I own the real estate that these companies sat on.  My office is in my home.  I average working about one hour a day before I go to the golf course.   
My wife works about an hour per day at her office in our house.  We choose to spend that time checking on our businesses.  My wife plays tennis most every day.  We vacation 6 or 8 times a year.    We have been married 43 years.  Our family life is great.   Last week we took our children and grand children to Disney World for a week.  Life for us is very very good.  
If I had stayed on the path I was headed in, I would be lucky to be alive.  Working in the oil field in Alaska's North Slope was very dangerous.  My family life was not all that good when I read these two books.
I encourage you to read these two books at least three times each and apply the principles they give you.  These books changed my life to one of great happiness and prosperity.  I hope they do the same for you."

I had read the 1960 Copyright version literally 12 times cover to cover, and I also have read Think and Grow Rich:  The 21st-Century Edition.  It was a treat to read the original version, written back in the midst of the Great Depression, and with hints/signs of a recovery in the air [applicable to our own times in 2008-2009].  To Napoleon Hill, a Positive Mental Attitude and thought control of one's own mind by will-power are all-important to personal success.

682,Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell,0765356155,Susanna Clarke,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell is not just a book about magic  it's much more than that. As the story progresses we're compelled strangely by the slow but smoothly progressing story of this interesting novel in three parts. It is fueled namely by the tensions that build between Strange and Norrell, whose personalities are essentially polar opposites. In an only too human way Strange, we find, becomes so intent on eclipsing Norrell's magical talents that he even neglects his own wife. Rather than throw it in the reader's face, it views the history of the time: how women were treated (namely Strange's wife) comes into play here. Susanna Clark has handled her story with a finesse I don't see much in the literary world anymore, because she has this rare talent of hiding her themes underneath the story without entirely rushing the reader with them. It's the patience with which she builds her story that interested me so. This is what we need more of: a love for story telling, because when a work of fiction is approached in earnest with this type of enthusiasm the work transcends--like it should--mere escapism."
682,Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell,0765356155,Susanna Clarke,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"I both enjoyed and was thoroughly frustrated by this book.  Each chapter taken individually is an entertaining and well written piece, and so I can't say I was ever bored while reading it.  The characters are quirky and interesting, the concepts at play are fun and inventive, and the narrative style contains a dry tongue-in-cheek humor that I loved.      However, this book is over 800 pages long, which is fine, but long books need a sense of an overarching plot unfolding as you go, and sadly that is missing from this book.  While I was generally entertained as I read, I was frustrated as I got to pages 300, 400, etc that the book just seemed to be rambling without going anywhere.  When the book did begin to pull all the loose ends together, it happened abruptly and ended fairly quickly, relative to the hundreds of pages of loose set-up that preceded it.    In the end, I'm glad I finished reading it, and the ending was satisfactory.  But it took me about 5 months to read, mostly because the lack of plot made it easy to put down and didn't offer a strong incentive to pick it back up again.  Memorable story and characters, but it drags.  Recommended only to those with great patience and a love of mild British humor and social comedy."
682,Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell,0765356155,Susanna Clarke,Barnes and Noble,4,Joel_M,"This definitely isn't your typical fantasy novel. Readers who only like the ""swords and sorcery"" fantasy sub-genre will hate it. This book feels like Charles Dickens and Jane Austen decided to collaborate on a fantasy novel after reading ""On Fairy Stories"" by Tolkien, ""That Hideous Strength"" by Lewis, and the ""Discworld"" novel ""Sourcery"" by Terry Pratchett. 

Most of it is set in England during the Napoleonic wars. There are some elements of alternate history as characters include real people like King George III, Napoleon Bonaparte, and the Duke of Wellington. However, in Clarke's world, England has a grand history of magic and dealings with fairies. At the point where the book picks up, no one has actually practiced magic or had dealings with fairies for at least a couple hundred years . . . until Mr. Norrell shows up and, later, Jonathan Strange.

Like the works of Austen or Dickens, the story is more character-focused than plot-driven. It kind of meanders its way (with occasional flurries of action or sudden surprises) through about 10 years as the two magicians seek to recover and restore English magic. The language is a bit old-fashioned, but with a very light tone and some dry/deadpan humor. There are lots of little ""scholarly"" footnotes citing (invented) sources and giving little snippets of ""historical"" occurences (usually involving fairies) that help give the book a feeling of depth.

Despite the light tone, much of the book is dark and gothic. The fairies in the book are not the cutesy-Tinkerbell-Disney fairies who are tiny, mischievous-but-generally-good people with pretty little wings. They are the older version of fairies from English/Norse folklore . . . not necessarily small, nice, or sane (by human standards) and fond of abducting any human who strikes their fancy or strays into places they should not. Add to all this a prophecy of the ""Raven King"" (the founder of English magic who once ruled Northern England and will someday return) and you've got yourself an amazing fairy tale!"

683,A Bend in the Road,0446696137,Nicholas Sparks,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Ahn,"Nicholas Sparks' interpretation of romance and misery gives the reader a chance to indulge in the story of a middle-aged mans pain, love, and his glimpse of happiness before another turning point. The author draws in the reader, giving the audience a chance to become a part of the story line. As well as feeling the pains of the characters, the hopes and happiness, and the will to live on. This book would be recommended mainly for young teenage girls because the storyline is based along the lines of romance and mystery that will most definitely catch young girls' attention in this heart-wrenching story."

I was given this book by accident and it was the greatest accident of my life. Imagine if every single person over the age of fourteen just disappeared. That's what happnes in the smal coastal town of Pedro Beach. And Sam Temple somehow is running it all. But he doesn't realize that people (besides him) have powers, super speed, telekinessis, teleportation, and super strength, just to name a few. And when an evil kid named Caine comes into the town (which is covered in a giant dome) Sam has to dicide whether to buy into Caine's to good to be true story,or keep guard and protect the kids of Pedro Beach.

685,"Gone (Gone, #1)",0061448761,Michael  Grant,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Ozzy12,Great read that kept me up at night. Would make a great movie
685,"Gone (Gone, #1)",0061448761,Michael  Grant,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"PROS!!!!  (1)Typically, I try to avoid books that have multiple characters¿ perspectives, but Michael Grant interweaved the stories of the characters in an easy to follow fashion.  (2)I was also impressed by Grant¿s ability to perfectly imitate the mind of a teen: usually, author¿s make their teen characters come to conclusions that an average teen wouldn¿t have thought to keep the story line going but Grant¿s characters¿ realistic choices made this book believable.  (3)Branching off of my previous statement, in this book the mutations and super powers were left unexplained which adds to realness of the story.   (4)Another significant aspect of the book was its detail in comparison with its length. As you probably are aware of, this book is 558 pages.  Most books that I have read that are that long usually cover months, some years, but  Gone only covers a span of 12 days. The detail spent on each day creates such a vivid picture that I can completely picture Perdido beach  as if been there several times before.  (5)The most powerful and mighty of all characters in this book is a severely autistic four year old. Not only is it an unusually and unexpected twist to the plot line, it provides several challenges: the challenge of teaching him how to use his power, figuring out how to make him aware of his environment, and allowing him to save the world without putting him at danger.     CONS!!!!!  (1) I didn¿t like how the wolves were able to speak. I understand that the idea isn¿t any more far fetched then the teen¿s having superpowers but  its just hard to accept and is the only thing keeping me from fully accepting the possibility of this actually occurring.   (2) The book would have been a better read if it had at least one segment in Little Pete¿s perspective. It would have provided an interesting viewpoint and a better understanding.  (3) I thought that overcoming the blink was a little bit to easy and if was really just a matter of saying no to a temptation, a couple of adults would have been able to survive.     Overall:  The book was an exciting and quick read and I¿m looking forward to its sequel."
686,"The Wedding (The Notebook, #2)",0446615862,Nicholas Sparks,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"""The Wedding"" is a sequel to Nicholas Sparks' well known novel, ""The Notebook"". However, calling it a sequel is techincally incorrect because it doesn't continue the story of Noah and Allie, but instead, it is a story of their daughter and her marriage. Like many couples would experience, Wilson and Jane found something missing in their marriage. Wilson realized that he spent too much time working, and too little time at home. The distance between him and his wife had grown over the year, and he was afriad that it would be too late for him to fix the marriage. Wilson was still deeply in love with his wife, therefore he turned to Noah for advice. Noah is known as ""the hopeless romance"", but will he be able to help Wilson? What will Wilson do to rekindle the love between him and Jane? As in many Sparks' novel, a surprising twist is waiting in the end, and it is not an ordinary Sparks' twist (don't want to spoil too much). I highly recommend ""The Wedding"", and if you haven't read ""The Notebook"" yet, you should (but it's not required because this could be a stand-alone novel). Also, ""Message In A Bottle"", ""A Walk To Remember"", and ""Dear John"" by Nicholas Sparks are also highly recommended!"

687,1776,0743226720,David McCullough,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"In my opinion, this is a must read for every American and especially those who enjoy American history. It is amazing to see how common, ordinary men and women, who believed in the right of liberty and freedom from tyranny, overcame tremendous obstacles against a major world power to achieve their goals.  David McCullough brings it all to life as he painstakingly describes the people, the battles, and the consequences of their actions. It is extremely heartwarming to see and feel the perseverance of these early settlers in overcoming extreme odds and suffering when they could have easily given up and succumbed to British rule.  They even had to fight within their own ranks against the Tories and Loyalists who put personal gain above independence.  I completed the book this week just as the John Adams miniseries is airing on HBO, which is superb as well.  Thank you David for a wonderful work that serves to remind all Americans and others as well of the price we paid for freedom and   of the inalienable rights of all men everywhere."

From page one it pulls you in and takes you along for the ride.  This is not a history book, this is an event.  It reads like a movie and tells the dramatic story of the American Revolution. Perfect marks, across the board. I'd recommend this for anyone who likes a good adventure/war story, regardless of whether or not they're a history buff.  It's that good."

688,Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith,0330419129,Jon Krakauer,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"As a native Utahn I am very familiar with the teachings of the LDS faith, have lived among Mormons'with little confrontation' most of my life, and do understand how members of the Mormon faith can easily take this book out of context and be offended by its theory. But one has to understand that the author clearly explains that the FLDS and the LDS are in fact very different, and he simply gives a general 'and well researched' history of how the FLDS church evolved from the mainline Mormon church, to supplement the story of the Lafferty Murders. If one'particularly LDS members' dive into this book with an agenda already in mind, I guarantee you will not like it one bit. But if one is purely interested in history and fact with an OBJECTIVE point of view, this will be an exceptional read."
688,Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith,0330419129,Jon Krakauer,Barnes and Noble,3.9,PatsyAnn,"A thought provoking look into the world of the lives of those living within the extreme Mormon sects.  The book includes interviews with those who have lived in these sects, some as victims and some who were convicted of crimes.  The book goes back and forth from the founding of the Mormon Church and it's history and that of the fanatical sects that left the official church.  A powerfully moving book with a wealth of information pertaining to the Mormon Church and of the leaders and lives of those living within the fringe sects.  This book will astonish you on many levels.  It will be disturbing at times.  I feel this book was well written and extremely informative.  A book to read if you are interested in a part of our society that most people might not even know of."
688,Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith,0330419129,Jon Krakauer,Barnes and Noble,3.9,CoppellBookLady,"Great book.  I have read every Krakauer book to date and am a real fan.  I am still not sure why he. an admitted agnostic, wrote a book critical of the Mormom faith rather than his normal on-the-edge adventures.  Even though, the book is atypical for Krakauer, it was a great read interweaving the history of the Morman religion with the recent fundamentalist break-off sects.  Krakauer's research is impeccable and he presents his information in a very interesting, easily understood and enjoyable fashion.  We read the book for our Book Club and had a great discussion of all of the issues.  I look forward to reading Krakauer's next book with ledgendary Pat Tillman as the primary subject."
689,Beautiful Ruins,0061928127,Jess Walter,Barnes and Noble,3.8,JanTX,"I work in a bookstore, go through books like water, and share all kinds of recommendations with customers.   I read British and Scandinavian mysteries, heavier novels like &quot;Freedom,&quot; literate non-fiction---generally, everything from best-sellers to classics.  So I'm not a book snob, but don't tend to read  the lightest of light, either.  I loved the Dragon Tattoo series, and all of Elizabeth Strout's books.  
Sometimes I plow through rewarding, beautifully written books.  But I do tend to whine a bit about this question--why can't authors write books that are entertaining, with mesmerizing characters, interesting settings, relationships between people that are real, flawed, but occasionally deep, and compassionate?.A story that makes me laugh, blink with recognition, and want to cheer out loud for the characters?  But where the story doesn't pretend life is not what it really is, either, so that I can't believe it.  Then I picked up Beautiful Ruins.  And there it was.  Buy this book, savor it, and encourage Jess Walters to keep writing."
689,Beautiful Ruins,0061928127,Jess Walter,Barnes and Noble,3.8,lindianajones,"This is a novel of utmost grace and beauty. It spans the decades from World War 2 to present day. It leads you lyrically through Italy and the United States. It trips through the automobile industry, the film industry and the writing industry. It drives you through learning Italian, teaching Drama and living your life. It takes you from the bottom of the worst bits of life to the peak of the ultimate best parts. A wonderfully delicious novel for all five senses. I read this book in two days, unable to put it down. Well worth the buzz it is getting."
689,Beautiful Ruins,0061928127,Jess Walter,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Anonymous,I am a voracious reader-at least two books a week.  I loved this book-it is the best work of fiction I've read all year.  It was beautifully written with wonderfully developed characters.  It was one of those novels that you're sad to see end.  I will be looking for other works by Jess Walter.
690,The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream,0307237699,Barack Obama,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Guest,"Absolutely amazing. Although I disagree with some of   Obama's views, he presents them in a way that requires   one to reexamine their ideas and beliefs. For every   argument he makes, he shows a real-world example and   provides a practically flawless arguement. I am a high   school senior and he writes in such a way that I   understand the issues he's discussing, even if I hadn't   previously deeply thought about them. This should be   required reading for AP Government classes."
690,The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream,0307237699,Barack Obama,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Guest,"I have to wonder when it became unpalatable to dream big in this nation. When did we stop believing in the power of our dreams? Yes, Obama wants what we all want for our country. But why is that a bad thing? I don't know if I believe he can fully achieve all that he talks about doing in this book, but he can definitely lay the groundwork for change. To me, that is what he is saying more so than 'I am the one who will come in and change this country.' He may not be able to change this country but I think the point is that he inspires us to want to change our country. We shouldn't let our fears and insecurities about something new stop us from wanting change as well. I found this book uplifting and it made me smile. Sorry if some think that those who support Obama aren't living in the 'real world'. But it's our very existence in this 'real world' that makes us WANT to support him."

Brilliantly written, this book is intelligent, thought-provoking and even-keel. Barack did a fantastic job. This book is clearly written and explains what he believes and why. It completely proved to me that he has the intelligence, experience and good judgement to make the best possible 44th President of the United States."
691,On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft,0743455967,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.5,WriterZero,"Stephen King's On Writing is one of the few non-fiction books I've ever enjoyed and I will probably read it again someday for inspiration and the helpful advice it gives. The book starts out as a small memoir of King's childhood, his family life, how he first found his passion for writing, and how he used his talent and determination to get where he is today, as well as meeting his friends and his future wife. The second part of the book is divided up into chapters of how each component of a good fiction book is to be written (plot, characters, word usage, grammar, etc) and it gives the basic dos and don'ts of literature.  The final part of the book is the King giving his farewell to his readers and a sneak peek at one of his other novels 1408 as well as a list of books that he liked to read and gave him inspiration.  The major themes of the writing are determination, knowing what you're doing, and passion for what it is you want to do, and in this book's case: writing. I liked all the helpful advice King gave and he gave it in such a way that it was easy to understand, and I liked how he wrote the book on a personal level, like he was speaking directly to the readers themselves. I had no major dislikes of the book, only some confusion at certain parts when King was describing the structure of literature. Someone who wishes to one day become a fiction writer, particularly if they wish write the same genre King writes, this is a perfect book to read to help them get started. King gives everything you'll ever need to know about fictional writing, from character development, to grammar corrections, to dealing with writer's block. It is the absolute fiction writer's instruction manual. I would recommend reading his other works, after reading On Writing, to see how he put his own advice to work and what the end result should look like. I personally would recommend The Long Walk or Rose Red. My overall rating on this book is five out of five stars; a hard-working literary master like Stephen King deserves no less. I too wish to be a fictional writer someday, and work in the same genre as King, so this book has been incredibly inspirational to me and has helped me harden my resolve to one day become an author like King himself. This book is one I will treasure for a long time."
691,On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft,0743455967,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.5,TheWriterRight,"Just so you know, this book is good for anyone. Anyone who creates or has to press on or has worked crappy jobs wanting to go forward. I gave it a shot and have not put it down. 

I am a writer. Not because I'm published, but because I sit for hours at my computer pounding out words that somewhat convey a cohesive story. Steven King probably didn't publish this book years and years ago for a couple of reasons. Of course, these are just guesses. But probably because he's tired of seeing the stuff this coming generation puts out, and also because we just might not have listened. But after his great success as a writer, he is, no matter what we have to say, a bit of an expert on it. What is great about this book, what is most meaningful is the fact that King has lived the life of an average writer. His folks didn't have tons of money, and he struggled much in the way I, type A commoner, struggles. But along with his self expose, he also teaches and uplifts. His voice jumps off the page and says, ""No excuses."" As a writer, I think this has been wonderful. Most of us don't have mentors pushing us in one direction or another. And most creative writers that we look up to don't really have the time. King's book took the mind of a mentor and put it into our hands. You don't have to read his type of fiction or even like it to really REALLY grow from this book. Yes, he may reference from some of them, but trust me, it won't be giving you nightmares. It'll be giving you ideas, telling you that it's alright to spend time on your work, and giving you permission to dream in ways that no one has ever told you it was okay. And it's not just for writers; it's for free thinkers."
691,On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft,0743455967,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.5,clasique,"I read this book back in 2001 and I still thing that it's a wonderful book for beginning writers to study. Stephen has dominated the horror genre for quite a long time. In his book he talks about how he got started, his love for writing, and why he continues to do so. 

Reading it again, I still could not put this book down until I had turned the last page. This book still remains one of my ""bibles"" on the art and craft of writing. Stephen advises the beginning writer to ""write every day no matter what."" 

His account of the writing craft is both funny, sarcastic, witty and downright truthful. His story of the author who was found sprawled out on his desk in despair because although he wrote only seven words, he did not know in which order they should go, still resonates with me even more now that I am writing my first novel. 

One of the other things Stephen mentioned is the undying love and respect he has for his wife Tabitha is by far a true plus. As writers we yearn to have someone, anyone in our corner. Thank you Stephen for handing me my very own secret weapon to writing. Bravo!"

It a beautiful story of friendship, but has other relationships including mother-daughter and wife-husband that are complex and fascinating. Hannah does a terrific job presenting 2 of the many different paths women can take in life: wife and mother or career. The characters in her book chose the extremes of these paths and therefore have difficulty combining them. I think that she presents these 2 choices beautifully and almost everyone can relate to these women's struggles and triumphs. And as a mother, her description of motherhood is spot-on! This book has humor, love, loss, laughter, tears.....it has everything. It is the best book I have read in a long time. I truly can't recommend it enough."
692,"Firefly Lane (Firefly Lane, #1)",0312364083,Kristin Hannah,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"First, I have to admit that I have a weakness for ""big books"".  I love a story that spans years.  This book is something special.  I finished it several days ago but just can't get it out of my mind.  

I am always reading at least one book but I can't seem to get past this one.  I almost feel disloyal to Tully and Kate to just continue reading something else.  Crazy, right?  

These girls grew up around the same time I did and perhaps that is why the story was so touching and personal for me.  However, I think anyone who has had a ""best friend"" no matter what age can truly enjoy this story.  

I had never read this author before and I'm looking forward to reading her other books.  If they are anywhere as good as this one I'm in for a great treat!

Read it!  Love it!"

This is my first experience with this author, but it will not be my last.  The plot was very well researched and well written.  It was a very sad book, but it relates the story of life-long friends - one who puts her friend above herself and the other who thinks only of what she wants and needs, not thinking of how this hurts her friend and family.  I was not able to put this book down once I started reading it."

I remember the inability to put this book down.  I was so scared and needed to find out what happened next.  The supense was killing me.

694,Love the One You're With,0312348673,Emily Giffin,Barnes and Noble,3.9,readtolive_livetoread,"The bottom line is that love, and the work it takes to make a committed relationship succeed, is a very messy process, one that many of us like to gloss over in hindsight. This book doesn't do that and I would argue that it's one of the most truthful depictions of that proces I've read in a long time. After I finished the final page, I was left wondering if the relationship that remained at the end of the book worked out in the long run. I am guessing that's the quesiton the author wanted to leave us to ponder. I found this book a bit difficult at first because the narrator seemed, I don't know, spineless in a way. How easily she acquiesced to her ex-boyfriend's proposal of being ""friends,"" how she couldn't conjure up anger at what he did to her in the past, etc. This didn't seem particularly promising since the entire book is told from this woman's (seemingly) weak perspective. There is never a ""repeat"" when it comes to love stories. Even though the drama may have happened once or twice before (girl meets man, girl loves man, girl meets new man, girl loves new man, girl loves both men, girl has to choose) the storytelling that surrounds the drama is what makes a book good or not.
Ms Giffin is talented in that she makes me care for her characters. Even though I want to strangle them for some of their decisions, I still care about them and really just want them to be happy in the end. This book keeps your interest pretty much the whole time. It is very relatable. I've read all of Emily Giffin's book and I love them all."

Newly married, she runs into a seriously passionate ex who left her years before, an encounter that causes her to question everything she's done since. This is a story that takes place primarily in Ellen's head as she struggles to figure out whether the choices she made were the right ones even as she crosses all sorts of moral lines. But within that storyline, Giffin constructs something smart, thoughtful and relatable. You can only imagine the trouble this could cause!  Happy reading! So worth your time!"
694,Love the One You're With,0312348673,Emily Giffin,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"This book wasn't bad, it just wasn't as good as Something Borrowed and Something Blue. The biggest problem I had with it was the lack of character development. All of the characters, including the narrator, were one-dimensional stereotypes. There wasn't one character that I really cared about, identified with, or felt like I ""knew"". I couldn't even envision what they looked like. The narrator, Ellen, isn't particularly interesting or likable, and that's a big problem.

I got the impression that we are supposed to sympathize with Ellen, sort of like we sympathized with Darcy in Soemthing Blue. But unlike Darcy, Ellen doesn't have the personality, the character developemnt, or the appealing quirkiness to make us understand or care about her. She just comes across as an ungrateful b*tch who doesn't deserve the loving, wonderful husband that she has. The extent of her inexplicable obsession with her assh*le ex boyfriend (who is basically ""Marcus"" from Something Borrowed and Something Blue, but with a different name) was never really explained to my satisfaction, nor was there a compelling argument made for why ""what they had"" (which was basically an emotionally abusive and unsatisfying relationship based purely on sex) was worth risking her marriage for.

The one good thing about this book is the character of Margot. I would like to see a book from her point of view, focusing on Margot, her husband, and their new baby but also touching on her friendship with Ellen and her feelings about Ellen cheating on her brother."
695,"The Silkworm (Cormoran Strike, #2)",0316206873,"Robert Galbraith, J.K.

'Cuckoo's Calling' is a terrific book--which really needs to be read to thoroughly enjoy this follow up.  However, I find 'Silkworm' improving upon the previous novel in several ways.  This is a leaner, meaner, faster, and more carefully edited read than the first Strike book.  'Cuckoo' did, at times, drag with unnecessary repetition of events and too much pondering of circumstances. This does not.  It starts off at a gallop and stays there until a rather breathtaking finish.  Once again, there is a rather labyrinth plot and cast of characters--you have to give it awhile to keep everyone and everything straight--but it is absolutely worth the ride.  Strike continues to be a compelling main character whose layers promise to be further revealed in future books--and his sidekick, Robin, is a delight just as she was in the first book.  But here--we find out a lot more about her; she grows as a character and it is refreshing to see her start reconsidering and re-evaluating her choices and earlier desires.  The last interaction between Robin and Strike in this book is especially charming.  One note of caution: the crime in this is far bloodier and gorier than in the previous novel.  There are graphic descriptions of violence here--and for the especially squeamish--well, be forewarned. And the conclusion of the mystery may take a second read to pull it all together.  But overall, a wonderful addition from Rowling (and yes, once again, there are some fun shout outs to the world of Potter)"

696,"The Vampire Lestat (The Vampire Chronicles, #2)",0345476883,Anne Rice,Barnes and Noble,4.5,E_Bennet,"I highly recommend this series.  I have read the first four novels (Interview, Lestat, Queen, and Body Thief).  While ""Interview"" may not thrill the reader as much as future novels, once you delve into ""The Vampire Lestat"", you'll be hooked!  Of the first four, ""The Vampire Lestat"" is my favorite.  Every word is another heartbeat shared with Lestat.  Rice creates a world and a creature so real, I swear one day Lestat will appear in the room while I'm reading.

Additionally, in comparison to the ""Twilight"" series, you'll find Rice's Vampire Chronicles to be written at a more advanced level, for a mature audience."
696,"The Vampire Lestat (The Vampire Chronicles, #2)",0345476883,Anne Rice,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"The story starts off a little slow, but picks up after Lestat starts telling his story. Before he was a vampire, he lived in a castle with his family in an area in France near Paris. Before he went to Paris, he hunted down 8 wolves that were killing sheep. It cost him his horse, his 2 beloved Mastiffs, and it nearly cost him his life. Then, a few months after he moved to Paris with his best friend Nick, a 700 year old vampire, who had never made a vampire before, named Magnus turns him into a vampire against Lestat's will. From there on out there are just too many adventures to go into detail about, but he eventually meets up with Louis and Claudia. This is an excellent book. I reccomend this book for anyone over the age of 13."

Wherein the hero of Interview with the Vampire (Louis) is a bit on the ""poor me"" side, here anti-hero Lestat is a classic narcassist with overflowing ego that fully captures the reader's imagination and attention. Awakened in modern day New Orleans, Lestat goes on a quest to become a famous rock star - all the while relating the tale of his upbringing as a young noble in France and his eventual turn into a vampire. One of the best vampire books I've ever read."

Loaded with tension and sense of foreboding, there are several places that were truly hard to read. The story surged forward with unpredictable twists and turns and kept me engrossed right up to the last page. Marina is a research doctor in Minnesota. A teammate, Anders, dies in the jungles of the Amazon. For some reason, her employer and secret lover, Mr. Fox, wants Marina to seek out the truth about Anders' death. She couldn't understand, why her? She has no skills in the area and knows little about the project in the Amazon. She and Anders were working together on a cholesterol drug. After getting together with Anders' grieving wife and sons, Marina feels it her duty to make the journey, even though she will once again meet her stern mentor, Dr. Annick Swenson. Swenson knows things about Marina that Marina wants to forget. Marina Singh's real exploration is her discovery of other people and of herself.

Read the synopsis and it sounds like a book about doctors and the Amazon and ethics; and it is.  But to me, the central theme of the story is about mentors.  How is it possible that our mentors and teachers keep us under their spell and eager for their approval for years after we've grown up?  Or for years after we've known them for the imperfect humans they really are?  Where does that pull come from?  In this story, nearly every person has a mentor they are trying to understand or trying to cover for or trying to earn praise from, then I found myself falling under their spells, too.  This was a very intriguing book and I recommend it to absolutely anyone who loves to read books several times to find something different each time."

698,The Silver Linings Playbook,0374533571,Matthew Quick,Barnes and Noble,4.3,CarlG,"A year ago this coming August, my wife of 32 years passed away from battling cancer for 16 years. The last year of grieving has been a hard one for me, and I found myself reading various books on recovery and grief, trying to find a way to cope with my own loss, but never really finding what I was looking for. That was until I read this extremely funny and yet somewhat sad novel by Matthew Quick, The Silver Linings Playbook, and found myself caught up in the personal recovery story of Pat Peoples, a college instructor who comes out of what he thinks is four months in a mental institution (it is actually a liitle longer than that) and tries to reconcile with his family, with past friends, his own shattered life, and possibly even with his ex-wife, who has actually become something of an obsession for him; an obsession that has him forever working out, trying to maintain a positive attitude and most important, to look for the silver lining, for the happy ending in his life that he believes is actually a movie produced and directed by God. Coming from a family of diehard Philadelphia Eagles fans, Pat tries to make peace with all those around him, goes to sessions with a therapist who shares more in common with Pat than he expected, and at the same time, work on making himself worthy to be reunited with his beloved ex-wife. Until he is introduced to a beautiful but equally messed up widow named Tiffany. Then Pat's life takes a sudden a dramatic turn, one that leads to discoveries of promise, betrayal, sorrow, despair, possible set-back and finally, hope and love. The Silver Linings Playbook is a story of Pat and Tiffany, two damaged souls who have experienced in their own ways unimaginable loss, emptiness and loneliness, and in the end, by becoming one, find not just the healing they both need and deserve, but true love. Soon to be a major motion picture starring Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper, wonderfully written by Matthew Quick, with characters you cannot help but like and even come to love, and set against the backdrop of a typical Philadelphia Eagles football season, The Silver Linings Playbook is probably the most entertaining and satisfying love story you could ever find. I found it not just an entertaining and enjoyable read, but for me, it has also become a source of my own healing from my own tragic loss. It does indeed show me that even in the blackest of times, silver linings and happy endings do indeed still exist, and where there is love, there is indeed hope."

699,Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea,076072850X,"Jules Verne, Anthony Bonner",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"If you're going to read one of the great classics of literature¿and you should¿don't pick up this edition.  It is a reprint of a version that dates back to the 1870s and was exposed more than 40 years ago for cutting nearly one-quarter of Verne's story and mistranslating much of the remainder.  Lewis Mercier was the man responsible for this travesty, yet the publisher tries to conceal what they've done by claiming the translation is by an anonymous hand.  An attempt is made to give the volume respectability by adding an introduction and notes by Victoria Blake¿who has no particular credentials for the task.  And that leads to goofs¿for instance, she claims Verne never wrote a novel about invisibility, so she mustn't know about the author's Secret of Wilhelm Storitz.  In fact, Blake's simply used the better editions that readers are advised to consult.  If you want to read Verne's novel, pick up the elegant Naval Institute Press edition, in a modern, complete, updated translation, with commentary by the leading American Verne expert today, Walter James Miller.  That book also comes with many of the artistic engravings that illustrated the original French first edition (no illustrations are to be found in the B&N Mercier reprint).  Less attractive but more academic is the Oxford Classics version of Twenty Thousand Leagues.  Either way, pick one of these to discover this novel, and don't be fooled by the appearance of respectability this book provides.

The only thing that I didn't think was that good about the book was that about every other page, Jules Verne would go into a paragraph description of the animals. For example, he would say something like: ""I just saw a tuna. But not the normal tuna, it was yellow-bellied, had dorsal fins that went at a downward angle, etc."" Otherwise, I thought it was a great read and well worth the money. I will be purchasing more of Jules Verne's books very soon. I highly suggest for you to read this book. Another thing, if you enjoyed watching the 1954 ""20,000 Leagues Under The Sea Film,"" I highly suggest the book because the movie only gives a small picture of what actually occurred during their submarine venture and the book tells you everything, and the occurrences are just amazing.The novel basically tells the story of Professor Arronax, Ned Land and Conseil who get taken aboard the Nautilus and experiences many adverntures, such as going to Atlantis, an underwater hunt, getting trapped in an ice block and much more.

700,"The Constant Princess (The Plantagenet and Tudor Novels, #6)",0743272498,Philippa Gregory,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Laura_Jane,"I read The Constant Princess after considering it for several years.  I Read The Other Boleyn Girl a few years ago, and had this one on my reading list.  The book is a first-person account of the life of Katherine of Aragon, wife of Henry VIII of England.  It begins in her late childhood and takes the reader through her first marriage to Henry's brother Arthur, his death shortly after their marriage, and then her years of waiting to ultimately become the Queen.  The reader gets a glimpse into Catalina (Katherine's spanish name) and her fiercely loyal personality.  She was the daughter of two of history's most powerful monarchs, and was a warrior queen herself.  

This fictionalized account was very well researched and beautifully written. It left me wondering how different our world would be today if only Arthur had lived, or if only Katherine had a son who lived, or if only Henry had been faithful to her.  Of course, these what-ifs are some of the most compelling questions of the past 500 years as the reign of the Tudors arched over some of the most impactful moments of European history. Without Katherine and Isabella, her mother, would England ever have accepted Elizabeth as its queen? The brutality and cruelty of this period of history is a fascinating counterpoint to Katherine's piety and the pageantry of her reign."
700,"The Constant Princess (The Plantagenet and Tudor Novels, #6)",0743272498,Philippa Gregory,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Lalima_Jenckes,"The story of Katherine of Aragon and Henry VIII is a portrayal of splendor, intrigue, and betrayal as played out in the late fifteen century Tudor Court. The author presents a humanistic characterization of Catalina, the Spanish Infanta, who travels to England to fulfill her parents long-standing wish of a political marriage with Arthur, the elder brother of Henry Tudor. The reader feels sympathy and concern for this fifteen year old girl who has left her family to travel across the seas to seal an alliance that was promised when she was three years old. The author develops a heroine who is determined to make her life a success, as she adjusts to the cultural expectations of a foreign court that is very different from the luxurious and pampered life-style that she has enjoyed with her parents in Alhambra. 

As the plot develops, the reader is privy to the inner thoughts of Katharine and her outer struggle to maintain her status as the rightful queen of England. The story line maintains suspense throughout the novel, even though the reader knows the ill-fated outcome of this historical character. 

Philippa Gregory is to be praised for her richness for detail, her thorough research and page-turning epic story of the ""Constant Princess"" that brings to life the Queen, King, and the men and women of the court who made choices that had far-reaching effects on the lives of the common man."

However, I am happy to say that Philippa Gregory's successful fictionalization of famous historical lives have made me more interested in what I have previously thought as the boring past. In this book, she draws the reader into the world of Catalina; Infanta of Spain, Princess of Castile, destined by God and the machinations of politics to be Queen of England. We watch her raised on the battlefield in the holy war of Isabella and Ferdinand against the Moors. We begin to understand that she was not only raised to be a figurehead Queen, but a responsible ruling Queen, as she is taught how to raise an army and wage war against her enemies.
We see her betrothed, and married to Arthur, firstborn son of King Henry, Prince of Wales, and the Rose of England. We watch an unlikely pairing change from indifference toward one another into true love and passion. We experience her heartbreak and grief, her will to survive, and her determination to follow the path laid out for her from early childhood, and a deathbed promise, that leads to the throne of England.
The story of Catherine of Aragon may just be the greatest lie ever told!"
701,Mrs. Dalloway,0151009988,"Virginia Woolf, Maureen Howard",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"Mrs. Dalloway is a difficult book to read, especially if you   do not enjoy reading or you are not a very apt reader.  I've   read several reviews on Virginia Woolf's books, and I have   to say that the main reason behind the bad reviews is   ignorance.  It is a day, and in this single day in a person's   life Woolf makes the closest representation of love in   writing I have ever read.  Simply genius, however difficult   the book is for you, I assure you that the ending makes it   worth it.  However, if by the time you finish it you feel like   Woolf failed and did not 'make sure something   happened', go watch an action film that's not too clever   for you. :)"
701,Mrs. Dalloway,0151009988,"Virginia Woolf, Maureen Howard",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Broket_Samling,"I will admit, when I first attempted to read this novel, I was intimidated by Woolf's complicated, dense prose and lack of plot substance.  I now can say that it is one of my favorite novels not for its plot (which is admittedly nothing more than one day in the life of a simple woman setting up for an evening with friends) or escapism in setting or fantastic characters but for the symbolism throughout.  The characters are shattered, fragmented (because of WWI, in my opinion) and seem to represent facets of society.  I found, in them, bits and pieces of my own self; I was forced to look upon the unpleasant and questioned the supposed ""good"" qualities.  The style of writing is quite virtuosic and needs a steady mind from the reader for interpreting the stream of thought and exit and entrance of each character.  It is for this reason that I would feel apprehensive in choosing this book for a readers group or class discussion.  Woolf's prose is very filling and consuming:  not something many casual readers would like when indulging in a book (which is also the reason I hesitate suggesting Mrs. Dalloway for literature classes unless they are advanced students who are taught the significant aspects of literature analysis).  On the whole, Mrs. Dalloway is quite a wonderful read, delving into the psychological and social aspects of what could be any given day in anyone's life."
701,Mrs. Dalloway,0151009988,"Virginia Woolf, Maureen Howard",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"I am not sure what I think about this book.  The writing is an interconnected stream of conscienceness among all the characters in the book.  You almost feel like you are floating from one characters mind to the next.  I don't think anyone could say that the author is not extremely talented but I did not find the book that enjoyable.  There is really not much plot more of portraits of each character.  Glad I read it though, I love to be exposed to different writing styles and ideas."

I totally fell in love with the characters and missed them when I was finished with the book. I have read 15 SK novels and this is the only one that gave me trouble sleeping. SK is the only author I know who can mix a love story into a horror story, add a few racy and explicit sex scenes (as is his style)and wind up with one spectacluar novel!! For those of you who think SK only does horror... READ THIS BOOK!"

703,Bag of Bones,067102423X,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Corey_Andreas,"I am, by no means, a Stephen King fan. I don't dislike him necessarily, but he's not my favorite by far. I had read one his older novels, and quite a lot of his short stories, but I could never really get into them in the way I got into other books, or other authors. It's his style. I guess with him there's this very weighty palpable air of: ""I'm a writer! Are you enjoying my writing?! These words, that I'm writing to you, dear reader?!"" Understand, I don't mean this is in the sense that he's arrogant, or pretentious at all, it's just to me, that seems to be his style of writing, and the connection that he feels between himself, being the writer, and his readers, is strong--one in which it seems that he's perpetually aware that he's writing TO someone. And it shows--that attitude manifests itself at the output of his novels and short stories-and that's a good thing, it really is. It's a good attitude to have, if I'm reading him, right. Just not so much for me, personally.
So, when I was given Bag of Bones to read, I wasn't sure if I would even be able to get into it. 
I was dead wrong.
I read this book-529 pages-in roughly four sittings. I seriously couldn't put it down, and, at first, I had no idea why. King's aforementioned style is still there, he didn't abandon it for this one, but for some reason it just worked for me in this context. I realized that the hilariously obsessive tone that King gave to Mike Noonan, the main character, is a huge reason why I was so absorbed in his story. Every little thought that ever crosses Mike's mind is dragged out of his head and painted onto the page for us to read-no matter how irreverent, heartbreaking, wonderful, vulnerable or premature those thoughts may be. There were quite a few moments during my reading, that I actually laughed out loud by one of Noonan's quick, jarringly wry comments-one time in which I had to close the book until I could gather myself enough to open the book and move on. That doesn't happen to me. Ever. Mike Noonan is a real person, and despite Mike Noonan's intelligence, and highly successful life, in his mind, he's an everyman. Mike Noonan is an incredibly round character, bursting with life. So much so, that you literally feel what he feels, as he's feeling it. Mike is real, and he feels alive, as do all the other characters in the book-no matter how small their role. Everyone is believable, and almost nothing is left to the imagination-right down to mannerisms, gait, and accents. Everything is fleshed out ad nauseum, at times, and the book is better for it.
To me, the third act, or whatever you want to call it, suffers the way most Stephen King's stories suffer. And it makes sense, I guess, when you think about it, considering his stories do follow a certain formula. Stephen is one of the best at setting up a story, and leaving tension. It's when King tries to resolve it, that we run into trouble. I just don't think he's very good at writing action-or at least I'm not fond of the way he writes action. Maybe it's because of the fact that he is so formulaic, that he's just naturally better at telling what could be there, instead of telling you what is there. The ending to Bag of Bones is a stupid lumbering mess, and really isn't that scary..just weird. 
But then, the epilogue seems to bring things back home, and all is right again with a story that you'll have grown to love.
So, do I recommend this story? Absolutely. I think it's one of the best novels I've read."
704,The Cider House Rules,0786226749,John Irving,Barnes and Noble,4.4,songcatchers,"This is a heavy-hearted novel. The dreams and wishes go unfulfilled for most of the characters. The Cider House Rules takes place mostly between the 1930's and 1950's. It's about rules. It's about how society has rules for people but those rules aren't always the right rules.  This is a story about Dr. Wilbur Larch, the ""saint"" of St. Cloud's, the head of an orphanage and an abortionist in a time when abortions are illegal. But it's even more about Homer Wells, an orphan who is never adopted and becomes a sort of son to Dr. Larch. This novel touches on some delicate issues besides abortion: incest, interracial relationships, lesbianism, child and spousal abuse and ether addiction. I really like the writing style which makes The Cider House Rules a good read. The content of the book is deep. The characters are believable and Irving provides a lot of background. I will absolutely be looking forward to reading other John Irving books in the near future!"
704,The Cider House Rules,0786226749,John Irving,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Mshchuk,"I loved this book, and its seemingly complex webs of human interaction and simple cause and effect.
Cider House Rules is not for those who lazily skip lines to get to the finish quicker, or those that cringe at frank exploration of taboo subjects, for in the moments one least expects it, Irving exposes some of the most important themes in his novels.
What I might possibly love most about Irving's writing is the manner in which he develops his story and the characters along with it. The books starts off with some knowledge about the protagonists that seems a bit insignificant, though shocking, as the middle section of the novel rolls around (there is admittedly a rather long exposition which very carefully evolves into rising action).
Throughout the novel readers learn about different characters' complicated backgrounds, which force us to sympathize with them. It's virtually impossible to choose sides in this novel - which is one of the major facts of life the characters have to learn to live with; that there really is no black and white, right or wrong, lord or devil's work (in reference to Larch's secondary, though no less important, job at the orphanage).
Another major theme in the novel is that no matter how much you may love someone, that's ""all you can do"" - you can't force them to love you back, you can't protect them - you can only love them. When I realized that this is in fact true of the world I further embraced Irving's genius at the most unsubtle and blunt manner in which he explores such a paradox.
The third major theme, which is executed brilliantly through the use of an orphanage as the central setting, is one to do with belonging and destiny. Larch belongs at the orphanage, though he is not an orphan, and he doesn't mind. He believes that nobody should belong to an orphanage, but eventually comes to the conclusion that Homer does. Homer believes he belongs at the orphanage, until he decides he likes his life at the orchard. However, it seems that Larch (as a sort of 'god' figure) has decided on the course of history, and Larch's 'history' ends up becoming the only history. 
As I have shown, this novel explores (rather psychologically and twistedly) the roles of all sorts of people and how each character's history twines with another's. 
An exceptionally profound read, this novel is sure to knock just about anyone's socks off."

706,Around the World in Eighty Days,014044906X,"Jules Verne, Michael Glencross, Brian W. Aldiss",Barnes and Noble,4,seeGreen,"I recently reread this book for this first time since I had to in school, many years ago.  Although it seems a fairly simplistic read, it still has a plot, while plausible and adventures, also plausible, that kept me wanting to keep reading it and finish the entire story.  Phileus Fogg and his servent Passeportout make up the main characters, almost in an odd couple styling.  Traveling by any means necessary to win a bet (not the money, but the honor) they are constantly playing off of each other with their conflicting attitudes.  I would recommend this for any young reader, it is a classic and easy to read and quick as well. For an older reader or an adult, in today's view it can seem simplistic and dated, and unchallenged, but it is still a great work by Jules Verne.  To anyone who hasn't read it, go for it, you have nothing to lose except a couple hours in which you can be with the imagery and travel to Egypt, India, Japan, American and back to London in a simpler time, yet many of the problems put into the path of Fogg, one can relate to today in their modern versions."

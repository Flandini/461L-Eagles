1520,A Canticle for Leibowitz,0060892994,Walter M. Miller Jr.,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"A Canticle for Leibowitz by Walter M. Miller, is an excellent read.    Written in the late 1950s, reading Canticle brings back the every day, never-ending, twenty-four hour threat of world-ending nuclear conflict we lived with during the Cold War. And it reminds us, who were around during those times, upon reading this story, centered around a Catholic monastery and seeing text littered with Latin phrases, the days when Latin 'mother to all the Romance languages' was studied, even in public schools.     I couldn't deter the smile that crept across my face, as I learned a character had lost a bet when he had come in second at the game of mumbly peg, a knife throwing contest popular during the middle of the last century prior to the discovery of 'dangerous' lead in paint, hazardous monkeybars, lifesaving seatbelts or XBox 360s. Yes, those were simpler times, when this boy of five could crawl up onto the sturdy and felt-covered shelf behind the rear seats in our four steel-doored 1951 Kaiser sedan and fall asleep bathed in the rays of the mild Arizona winter sun.    'Canticle' which means religious chant, is unabashedly Catholic, as is demonstrated when a brother fights for a natural death of a radioactive and terminally ill mother and daughter pair, rather than give in to the quick,  convenient, and no charge 'Soylent Green-style' euthanasia. Canticle also meets another one of my preferred old-school moral criteria for Science Fiction, and that being that there are no sexual copulations within its covers.    Canticle is not a Harry Potter 'type' happy ending book, and as Joe Bob Briggs says about good horror movies, 'Anyone can die, at anytime and anyplace.' For a book written almost fifty years ago, author Miller does an excellent job of predicting future technology. And he did not make the mistake I've seen often in mediocre SciFi books, that of centering the majority of the action on the 'predicted' technology, which, if the author has guessed wrong, and when read in later decades simply renders the book just silly.    Covering a span of six hundred years on Earth, the book exposes the unrelenting greed, lust for power and pride of a few men that will forever threaten those wishing to live in peace and, if their weapons are sophisticated enough, threaten continued civilization on this planet.     Canticle offers to the reader a compelling, effortless writing style that, after a few moments, other than the turning of pages, one doesn't feel like one is reading. It allowed this reader to develop affections for believable characters and presented entirely believable future technologies, while at the same time the strong moral code adhered to by the clergy of the Catholic faith, in this day of anything goes, even for this lapsed Lutheran, was quite refreshing."
1520,A Canticle for Leibowitz,0060892994,Walter M. Miller Jr.,Barnes and Noble,4,JL_Garner,"Not being a big fan of a.) post-apocalyptic sci-fi, and b.) the Roman Catholic church, I was surprised at how deeply and completely Walter Miller's classic ""A Canticle for Liebowitz"" drew me into its well-crafted world.The novel centers on a monastic community in the American southwest which devotes itself to preserving the remaining scraps of Western knowledge following World War III. The novel is divided into three parts: ""Fiat Homo,"" during the depth of the new dark ages, in which an old electrical diagram is found; ""Fiat Lux,"" several centuries later, in which someone figures out how to make a working incandescent light; and ""Fiat Voluntas Tua,"" in which technology finally catches up, and the human race finds itself on the verge of repeating history.The characters in the first two sections are really well-written and colorful, and the amount of detail put into creating this future world is considerable. Unfortunately the third act feels a bit rushed and prone to broad comedy, whereas the first two segments had an undercurrent of wry wit about them.Most readers will want to have a good Latin-English dictionary handy (or access to an online translation site like Babelfish), as the book -- written pre-Vatican II -- has a few lines (and one prayer at the beginning of the third act) in Latin.This is definitely a well-written, engrossing novel, and while the threat of a wipe-out-the-earth nuclear ""shooting war"" may have passed with the collapse of the Iron Curtain, ""Canticle"" still makes for a great read."
1520,A Canticle for Leibowitz,0060892994,Walter M. Miller Jr.,Barnes and Noble,4,JGolomb,"""A Canticle for Leibowitz"" is a book that defies standard categorization. I suppose it has enough future-world, post-apocalyptic concepts that it falls in the science fiction realm, but it's not your basic laser beam and alien fare. This story goes much deeper.

""Canticle"" is made up of three stories that span thousands of years. Each story focuses on a distinct time period, looking progressively further into a post-apocalyptic future. The setting is the same abby in the American West, founded to protect and preserve the learnings of the pre-apocalyptic society. Specifically, they've developed a myth around a martyered scientist named Leibowitz. 

The first story revolves around Brother Francis who accidentally discovers certain original papers created by Leibowitz, including the blue prints for a technological device. The second story centers on a new technological awakening where future theorists come in contact with ancient (modern) technology. The sequence comes full circle in the third story as our future world is faced again with mutual mass destruction. 

Miller wrote ""Canticle"" in the late '50s when World War II and the atomic bomb were still visible in the world's rearview mirror and the cold war threat was very much a reality. Much of Millers discourse is on the cyclical nature of cultures and societies, the interconnectivities between religion and science, as well as death and politics. It's clear that much of the evocative emotion stems from Miller's time in the military and a youth grown up during a World War.

The story is at times light and humourous but threaded with a very heavy and serious undertone throughout. 

The root story I found very interesting - how this future-world's archaeology is our modern world's past. I felt that the first two segments of the book were strongest and was only saddened that each couldn't have more ink themselves. In reflecting upon the discoveries of their past, and their promises of hope for the future, Millers writes, ""For Man was a culture-bearer as well as a soul-bearer, but his cultures were not immortal and they could die with a race or an age, and then human reflections of meaning and human portrayals of truth receded...Truth could be crucified, but soon, perhaps a resurrection.""

The development of religion, while always founded in christianity, morphs over the course of the story and we see a mythology grow over time. This book is successful on many levels...as simply an intriguing story with attractive characters, and as literature built upon a foundation of religion and war. It's solid story telling at its best, with heart, emotion and intelligence layered on top of the tale from start to finish."

For those who haven't read it yet, I'm not going to spoil it for you.  But keep in mind, there is a very good reason why it is required reading in many high schools.  I read this one after reading ""Medea,"" and I instantly become hooked on all of the Greek authors.  Though relatively short compared to other works of that time period, the story is very profound, and tends to keep the reader hooked right up until the end."
1522,Brooklyn,1439138311,Colm T??ib??n,Barnes and Noble,3.5,MJinPA,"This Colm Toibin novel is one of the best books I have ever read. I love the delicate, thoughtful prose. The dialogue - such a hard thing for most writers to pull off - feels very real, too, as does the depiction of the immigrant experience. Slowly, patiently, and very deliberately, Toibin drew me in by narrating from protagonist Eilis' point of view and even reviewing previously-described events from Eilis' perspective. I was lulled into that state you may associate with a good movie: as you become attached to the characters, your stake in a particular sort of ending increases. And herein lies Toibin's skill: he drew me in *twice* -- tricked me with no trickery -- such that his quietly-worded ending delivered me an indescribably powerful punch. Unbelievable."
1522,Brooklyn,1439138311,Colm T??ib??n,Barnes and Noble,3.5,SAHARATEA,"This is a simple and gentle story about a young woman's immigration to New York from Ireland in the years after WWII.  Much of the novel contains her personal thoughts and her analyzing her future and decisions and life in general.  It has an easy pace with lots of descriptive elements and a vast array of characters.  

I really wanted to love this book, but it just seemed oversimplified.  I think virtually anyone could have thought up the plot if they were given the basic elements (girl alone in big city, first real job, meeting new people, family crisis).  In fact, at one point it felt like an After School Special.

While Toibin depicts the female brain very well in some areas, there are other things that don't ring true.  For example, other than her work and classes, the main character seems to have no curiousity about the world in general, or about the exciting new country she has come to.  In subjects such as racism and the Holocaust, not only does she know nothing but she has no interest in learning more.  And while we hear much of her thoughts, some subjects she doesn't even visit mentally:  when her female boss makes a sexual pass at her, she feels uncomfortable but never ponders it again.  Yet she ponders so much more trivial stuff all the time throughout the book (what to wear or where to eat)
.   
Additionally, while there are some tragic events, overall there doesn't seem to be enough conflict to make the story interesting.  All the other characters are almost too good to be true, some crusty or cranky but all of them (excepting Miss Kelly) are big hearted and generous.  Money is never really an issue, and things go amazingly smooth for such a huge life change.  Again, that seems incredibly unrealistic.  And the strange behavior of her fiance's moodiness, her mother's unpleasantness, and her landlady's suspicions are never really explored.

I intend to read more of his work (I have ordered the Blackwater Lightship) and I hope things become a bit more complex and realistic."
1522,Brooklyn,1439138311,Colm T??ib??n,Barnes and Noble,3.5,CelticReader,"I enjoyed ""Brooklyn"" a great deal.    The character of Eilis was complex in personality; the story was well-written and it drew me in. The ending was not quite what I expected (a good thing!) The cultural issues of post-WWII Ireland and the US rang true as well. A lovely read!"
1523,"Wither (The Chemical Garden, #1)",1442409053,Lauren DeStefano,Barnes and Noble,4.3,BooksWithBite,"This book is the BOMB DIGGITY! For real. It totally exceeded my expectations and left me with wanting more. Not only was this book one unique read, it totally captured every part of me as I read it. I held my breathe as my eyes raced across the pages reading every emotion, every secret, every betrayal.


For Rhine everything is fake. She is forced to be a bride to a man she has never met or know. Forced to lived in a nice prison with other sisters wives. Though her time is short, she will not live this way. She longs for her freedom and just wants to be home safe. With danger lurking around every corner, Rhine learns everything and anything, plays the role she needs to play in order to get out.


This book is just WOW. It blew me away. Literally. I was so engrossed in the book, so connected with Rhine that I felt her angry, her pain, her longing for freedom. She was so strong. How she manages not to fall apart completely is beyond me. Poor thing had to just keep picking herself up and keep going. Rhine played her role so good, at times I thought that maybe she was giving in. That she would comply and just live the life she was given. But no, she always came back to remind herself of what is really at stake. Gabriel was nice touch to the book. He let Rhine true self come out and I loved learning about her through him.


I don't want to give to much away, but man this book is just unexplainable. You just have to read it in order to understand what I am trying to say. Ms. DeStefano, your book is complete and total awesomeness. It is the best book of  2011. Ms. DeStefano did what books are supposed to do. Take you away for an adventure of a lifetime. And this adventure, is one that I will never forget."
1523,"Wither (The Chemical Garden, #1)",1442409053,Lauren DeStefano,Barnes and Noble,4.3,TiBookChatter,"In the not too distant future, women are dying at the age of 20 and males by the age of 25. Only the First Generation can outlive them, and although many have tried to come up with an antidote for the virus that takes their young, so far.no one has been successful. In an effort to save the human race, young girls are abducted and forced to be sister wives who share one husband. Their goal? To produce as many children as possible before dying. After her parents are killed in a lab explosion, sixteen-year-old Rhine is abducted and forced to marry Governor Linden, who is twenty-years-old and approaching his twilight years. Rhine is a beauty with very unusual eyes. It's because of her eyes, and her likeness to another girl named Rose, that she is chosen as a bride. However, when she arrives at the house she realizes that she is only one of three new wives and that a fourth is on her deathbed. Although Governor Linden is actually quite likable, his father, Housemaster Vaughn is anything but! His presence in the house makes Rhine very uncomfortable and when one of her sister wives has a baby, Rhine becomes concerned over what is being done to the baby. Add to that her attraction to a handsome attendant by the name of Gabriel and Rhine finds herself conflicted over what she needs to do. Polygamy is a loaded topic and DeStefano tackles it successfully. At times, the idea of young, pregnant brides is disturbing, but with the human race dying out as it is, somehow the idea isn't so bad. The topic is handled delicately and there is nothing overly graphic or violent contained within these pages. I'd say that the target age range of 14+ is accurate. From an adult perspective, I found the book utterly readable and fun. There's the whole class struggle thing going on, as well as the conflict that being a sister-wife creates. It was a quick read, and the pages flew by and at the end I found myself looking forward to book #2. If you like to delve into YA now and then and like dystopian fiction but not necessarily the violence, then this might be a good book for you."

After reading the overview, I knew I had to get this book, and I wasn't disappointed! Unlike so many teen books, Wither is unique and unpredictable, containing no super natural characters..hallejuah! I recommend this novel, and I'm hoping for a sequel, and if there is one I know I will love it:)"
1524,Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis,0062300547,J.D. Vance,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"I saw an interview with Mr. Vance on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" and knew I had to read his book.  As a veteran teacher in the Rust Belt, the story of his youth describes a growing number of my students and their home lives.  While I witness firsthand why these children are not making it academically and exhibiting increased behavioral issues, it is more politically correct to blame  the educators, schools, the government and their failed public policy for the decline in our students' abilites to compete in this global economy.   JD Vance does not offer a solution to these problems, but he does suggest ""It can start when we stop blaming others and ask ourselves what can we do to make it better."""

Vance,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"There is nothing really surprising in this book, but it is very welcome to have a frank look at these truths about American life. Vance uses his Ivy league advantage to give his memoir a heartfelt shove on to the national stage. His story is moving, scary, and aggravating in turns as he navigates through childhood in decaying towns in Southern Ohio to what most would consider a life of great success. Yet he can't really leave his past behind and,understandably, doesn't really want to. Its just a question of self preservation. Truly it can be hard to know where you fit in the world. Recommend."
1525,"Crossroads of Twilight (Wheel of Time, #10)",0312864590,Robert Jordan,Barnes and Noble,3.8,GeraldTarrant,"The first time I read CROSSROADS OF TWILIGHT, shortly after it came out in paperback, I was monumentally confused.

It seemed as though nothing was happening. Many of the characters were difficult to recall, and I found myself constantly referring to the glossary or previous books in the series in a desperate search for clues. Who is this Aes Sedai again? What is their relationship with Egwene &ndash; friend or foe? Who was this character? Why are they important? Are they important?

It all proved too much for me, and I was beginning to suspect that Robert Jordan might not live to finish the series, so I quit. Ten books into the series, I decided I was out, and I wouldn&rsquo;t buy another book until the end was nigh.

So several months ago, with A MEMORY OF LIGHT (completed by Brandon Sanderson) on its way to bookshelves across the nation, I endeavored to start again from the beginning, and read every book in the series consecutively. The idea was that reading the books back to back (to back to back to back) would iron out the confusion

So now that I&rsquo;ve read the first 10 books in the series, I can positively tell the me from 2004 that it&rsquo;s not his fault. Even reading the books consecutively, it&rsquo;s difficult to remember all the characters and their relationships. The monster has grown too huge for Jordan to handle, and so inevitably we get books such as CROSSROADS OF TWILIGHT, in which all 822 mass-market paperback pages are setup. The book doesn&rsquo;t end with a battle, there&rsquo;s no climax in the final pages, all the steps to move the plot forward are incremental.

It&rsquo;s.

All.

Setup.

I don&rsquo;t want to include any plot spoilers, but if you&rsquo;ve read the previous book in the series, WINTER&rsquo;S HEART, I&rsquo;d like you to think back to that book and consider what plot lines you&rsquo;d like to see wrapped up. I can tell you right now, they don&rsquo;t.

The bad guys all seem to have disappeared, so that the most frightening foe in this book seems to be the town where people are seeing ghosts. That and, as others have pointed out, the weevils that get into the food.

I wish Jordan could have managed his plots a little better so that some major development takes place in each book. Either Rand should have killed a Forsaken or the Aes Sedai struggle should have been resolved or Perrin&rsquo;s search for his wife should have come to a conclusion. Heck, I&rsquo;d have settled for something big in the Mat plotline.

But none of those plots are resolved and as a result, we got 800 pages of filler.

It&rsquo;s no wonder I was so confused in 2004, and it&rsquo;s no wonder I stopped reading.

I&rsquo;m about to start on KNIFE OF DREAMS, the last book Jordan published before his death. I hope it&rsquo;s great. I hope Jordan&rsquo;s final book is as strong as EYE OF THE WORLD was, and Brandon Sanderson brings the series home with a bang.

I&rsquo;m tired of the filler. I&rsquo;m ready for Tarmon Gai&rsquo;don."
1525,"Crossroads of Twilight (Wheel of Time, #10)",0312864590,Robert Jordan,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Anonymous,"After reading the positive reviews of this book, it's obvious they are either mistaking this book for another in the series, or rating the series as a whole.

By the end of this pile of blindingly tedious crap, you'll want every female character in the story to meet a tragic end and be replaced by someone less boring (a role that could easily be filled by a slightly gifted garden slug).

Perhaps the only testament to Robert Jordan's genius in this installment is that he managed to get published an entire novel in which absolutely nothing happens."

1526,The Red Badge of Courage,1580495869,Stephen Crane,Barnes and Noble,2.9,MKirchner on LibraryThing,"Some Call it a Classic, but I¿m not Sure WhyWhen I chose to read The Red Badge of Courage I had certain expectations for the book.  Being regarded as a classic I assumed there would be epic struggles throughout the book, focusing on soldiers of different ranks and authority as they fought and died with honor and dignity.  I also thought that the book would be easy to read and comprehend, since it isn¿t a very long book.  Because it was such a short book I also figured that it would immediately jump into the action and grab me making me want to read more and more.  After I started reading it though, I knew I was in for a much different experience.If I had made a smart decision I would have stopped reading The Red Badge of Courage and picked up another book after the first couple chapters.  The way they were written made important features to the story seem confusing and uninteresting by using strange narrative choices and unrecognizable terminology (to me at least).  I kept on reading because I knew it was a classic, so I figured that the story was going to get better.  To my disappointment as the story went on, the action became more abundant, but the way it was portrayed was unchanging.  Although these complaints are probably just my feelings caused from not being exposed to this type of literature, I suspect that I am not the only individual who had trouble reading this book.  Another reason I found this book hard to read is the dialogue.  Most of the conversations consist of dialogue such as, ¿Well, he was a reg¿lar jim-dandy fer nerve, wa¿n¿t he?¿.  This is interesting at first, but about halfway through I was tired of it.  I think that the book would have been better if the strange talking was just toned down a bit.I enjoyed the characters in this book for the most part, but only a couple of them were memorable.  The author of The Red Badge of Courage, Stephen Crane, portrays the characters in a strange way.  For instance, Henry Fleming, the main character, is often referred to as, ¿The Youth¿, and is rarely referred to by his actual name.  this let me connect to him in a different way, but it takes so long for him to introduce his name that it became annoying.  He also did the same thing with all the other characters in the book, referring to people as ¿The Wounded Soldier¿, and ¿The Lieutenant¿.  One of the things I truly admired about this book was the character progression throughout the story.    I liked the way ¿The Youth¿ became stronger and more courageous from battle to battle and how his views changed about his fellow soldiers.  Overall I was not very fond of The Red Badge of Courage mainly because it was tough to read.  All the strange narrative and dialogue choices made me have to read certain parts two or three times before I truly understood what was going on.  I didn¿t necessarily have a problem with the events that took place in the story, in fact I found them to be a bit interesting, I just did not like the way the book was written.  Looking back now, I can understand why others may have liked this book, but it just wasn¿t for me."

1528,"Gardens of the Moon (The Malazan Book of the Fallen, #1)",0765348780,Steven Erikson,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Dire1973,"While waiting for the 6th installment of the Song of Fire and Ice series I decided to give this series a try. I was pleasantly surprised to find a writing style and story telling ability that renders a picture of the story without bogging the story down with countless details. Too many times I start a fantasy series and the first volume is dry and sluggish due to the over encompassing load of lineage and detail poured down your throat. This book doesn't pit Good vs Evil because the characters remain grey and are faced with moral choices and paths that make them choose between their own best interest and their allegiance to the group they are working with. 
    If you are the type of reader who enjoys a book that draws you right into a story line and doesn't weigh you down with over descriptive narrative then give this series a try
    If you are the type of reader that needs to know that the assassin that was just introduced to the story hails from generations before him and need all the surnames and accomplishments of his forefathers and enjoy knowing that the grass he just made camp on was a rare mixture of 5 different types of foliage when none of it applies to the story then you probably won't like this series.

This series tells you just enough about the characters that they remain light and interesting and a bit mysterious. They are not the all knowing stereo typical maiden in the woods, knights in shining armor or long lost last person of a bereft magical family that must figure out how to use his power to save the world."

This book is a bit of a beast to work through, but when you get to the end (and more-so in subsequent books) its well worth the effort.  Amazing characters fully realized in a captivatingly detailed world.  I'd recommend this book to anyone, as long as they're willing to put up with learning about a lot of characters going in many different directions.

One of my favorite authors, and the start to a series that, 9 books in, is still operating head and shoulders above other series in the genre."
1528,"Gardens of the Moon (The Malazan Book of the Fallen, #1)",0765348780,Steven Erikson,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"Have you read Erikson yet? Have you? Seriously, put down that kiddie fantasy novel. Step away from the Harry Potter section. Move aside from the usual dreck that the 'fantasy publishers' seem to be churning out and pick up Steven Erikson's Gardens of the Moon.    We've all read the epic fantasy novels. You were all-in on Jordan, until an Aes Sedai tugged her pig-tail once too often, and you realized that the plot had escaped his grasp, and you were doomed to books that more resembled Dawson's Creek. You read and loved George R.R. Martin. You've found Michael Stackpole. You sit waiting for the next J.V. Jones novel. You sobbed as Tad Wiiliam's 'To Green Angel Tower' crashed his series to a car wreck of a halt.    But you never read Steven Erikson...    And you should.    Quickly.    You need him.    Fantasy meets Apocolypse Now. Erikson's characters don't just find the Heart of Darkness, they live, die and kill in it. As Tarantino does for movies, Erikson does for the fantasy genre...infuses crackling dialogue, dynamite characters, ironic twists and turns, sharp plotting, and even lets his novels lose some control, and yet, once the climax hits and the destruction comes, everything seems to fall together.    You will never meet another author who creates so much, only to smash his characters together with the explosive power of an atom bomb. A mad genius from Canada, this series is already 6 books in. Everyone of them a masterpiece. Book 1 throws you into the mix with one hell of a slam bang ending...but Book 2 launches it into outerspace. Book 3 exceeds even that and that is the level of greatness you stand on when you consider this book and author...and I've read all the stuff you have...so I don't say it lightly.    Read it. You might even find it startling and not sure if you like it as you read of mages torn to shreds...battles that make Tolkien seem more like Choose Your Own Adventure.    But by Book 2, you'll thank me."

The book has never found a place on my out-of-control To Be Read list, but somehow it has found its way onto my MP3 player in audio format.  And glad I am of it.

This book could not be described as plot driven by any stretch of the imagination.  It is the story of Athena, a young woman who discovers that she has unusual abilities-the kind of abilities which in a less enlightened age would have condemned her to burn at the stake; but is this age really more enlightened?  Throughout the book, which is told from various viewpoints, we follow Athena as she teaches herself, is taught by others, and ultimately becomes a teacher herself.  As she works her way through the mediums of dance, calligraphy, and meditation, we see her discover her ""center"" and learn to channel an ancient spirit, giving voice to wisdom and warning.

As a Christian, there were times when the themes of the book made me more than a little uncomfortable, but as the story flowed on, carried by Paulo Coelho's intense, gripping characters, one central truism came into focus.  At the core of each of us there is a soul, and no matter what higher being we pledge ourself to (if indeed any at all) the essence of who we are is unchanged.  In my attempt to better understand my soul I have never employed any of the same practices as Athena, but I can wholly understand her journey to find her center, because I have a traveled the same journey.  I have simply followed a different path.

The characters narrate chapters in turn, giving the reader a variety of viewpoints.  As previously mentioned, I listened to the audio narrated by Rita Wolf, who did a marvelous job infusing distinct personalities into each character. 

Those not of a New Age mindset might find the premise of the book a little much to handle, but if you can let go long enough to immerse yourself in the beauty of the writing-Coelho paints characters of astounding depth-you will find a good deal of insight here.  While character development is the driving force of the novel, there is of course some element of a plot, complete with a hint of mystery and suspense, which Coelho brings to a sound conclusion."
1529,The Witch Of Portobello,0007251866,Paulo Coelho,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Anonymous,"I picked up Paulo Coelho's The Witch of Portobello because I liked the Alchemist, and I liked the idea of an exploration into feminine spirituality.  I found that I was hooked into the story initially because of the immediate revelation that the main character had been murdered and the unconventional writing style of having the story about her be told by the testimonies of the people who knew her.  As easy as it was to get into the book, I found it that difficult to finish.  The initial intrigue into the main character's life turned into boredom over the details of her strange life.  If the unusual nature of her life was supposed to reveal some understanding of the divine feminine, I found that it was only superficial at best and left me unsatisfied at the end of the book."
1529,The Witch Of Portobello,0007251866,Paulo Coelho,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Guest,"You will actually have to read this novel all the way to the last   paragraph to get it.  Don't give up half way through.  Initially,   I was like, 'what is this....book about really'.  But I continued   to read it, because I purchased it in Paris, with euros, and   paid a premium.  This is, how and why I ultimately decided   to finish the book."

This was a very interesting adventure with the Murry children and magic, one of the books that makes you take a reality check.  Charles Wallace is like my little cousin, James, because he is brave, smart, quiet, and shy.   Meg, like me, is not very adventurous.  She always has to keep an eye on the younger sibling.

1532,Sing You Home,1439102724,Jodi Picoult,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Crazy-for-Books,"I don't know how she continues to do it, time and time again. Picoult just has a knack for creating characters that you love (and hate!) and storylines that are chock full of so much depth and emotion that you can't stop reading until you know what the outcome is. Sing You Home will probably be one of the most controversial books she's ever written. There are so many questions that she explores in this book (from her website): * What does it mean to be gay in today's world? * How reproductive science has outstripped the legal system * Are embryos people or property? * What challenges do same-sex couples face when it comes to marriage and adoption? * What happens when religion and sexual orientation - two issues that are supposed to be justice-blind - enter the courtroom? * What constitutes a ""traditional family"" in this day and age? I'm sure just reading through those thought-provoking questions, you had a knee-jerk, strong response to one or more of them. I think we all do. And that's the point of this book. To explore those questions. Picoult isn't afraid to tackle the tough social issues. But she does it in a way that is honest, really capturing the essence of each side of the argument. Of course, she throws in a couple of characters that you loathe - the stereotypical ""crazy"" religious lawyer and the pastor with his own agenda who is pushing Max to do some things he is not entirely comfortable with. But, with those characters aside, I think Picoult did an excellent job capturing both sides and laying out the story the way she did. The story is told from 3 perspectives - Zoe, Max, and Vanessa. At the beginning of each section, the reader is told who will be narrating and the font-type is different for each character, which is a fantastic idea! Each character is developed extremely well. Picoult is able to capture the essence of each character, with appropriate backstory and supplemental characters, to really give the reader a true picture of who Zoe, Max and Vanessa really are. The narrative flowed like a movie in my mind. Hollywood - are you reading this? I could seriously picture this movie on the big screen. Picoult takes the reader step by step through each phase of the book. There are no odd time shifts or parts of the narrative that seemed out of line to me. The only thing that I took issue with is how quickly Zoe and Vanessa's relationship developed. I'm not sure, after being with Max for nine years, that someone could realistically work through all of that and fall in love with another person that quickly. In case you couldn't tell, I thought this book was amazing. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good story, with lots of controversy! No matter which side of the issue you fall on, this book will give you something to talk about. Conclusion This is a moving, heartfelt, emotionally-packed novel that will keep you riveted until its stunning conclusion!"
1532,Sing You Home,1439102724,Jodi Picoult,Barnes and Noble,3.7,kikifitz,"Music therapist Zoe Baxter and her husband Max, want desperately to have a child and all their failing attempts are starting to take a huge medical, financial and emotion toll on their marriage. When she suffers a heartbreaking stillbirth well into her last pregnancy, it is the final straw for the marriage and Max walks out of the house and out of their life together. Dealing with both these losses, very depressed, Zoe finds herself turned around by the friendship of a counselor at one of the schools she works at, a friendship that turns quickly (perhaps too quickly to be really believable) into a romance. Add to that the fact that her new love is a woman, Vanessa. Quickly (maybe too quickly again) married in Massachusetts, the couple decide to get use the frozen embryos Zoe and Max have to try and have a baby together, with Zoe's new spouse carrying the child. But when she goes to Max to get permission, she finds herself in the middle of a court case, being sued for custody.  

Rarely have I been so disappointed in a book. Not for the controversial subject matter, no, not at all! In fact, just the opposite. No, what disappointed me is that Sing Me Home presents these topics in such a one sided, unfair, incomplete way, so less than what they deserve. I may suggest that part of the problem is that this books wants to take on just too many controversial questions in one book. These are interesting and very important questions presented in this book, questions no doubt decided in many a court case these days. But these issues deserve better than the one sided, one dimensional portrayal Picoult gives us. 

On Zoe's side, the characters are almost saints, noble, good, selfless people. Even her lawyer, who will soon be getting a halo no doubt, is just such a nice person. How can you not agree with her? Zoe and Vanessa are so nice, how can we not want them to win? On the ex-husband's side, everyone is evil and conniving, with totally selfish and nasty motivations. Max is a weak fool, with a reoccurring drinking problem, being used by others for their own, selfish, evil reasons. His lawyer is so loathsome that he only lacks a waxed mustache to twirl as he laughs a creepy laugh, to be complete. Yes, it is hard to portray people we really disagree with as decent people, with valid arguments..so much easier to paint them with a broad, ugly brush.

I think this books starts by exploring some serious and timely topics that deserve better than the caricatures that the author descends into in the last half of the book. I don't think we get far in a discussion, as individuals or as a society, by just painting 'the other side', whatever that might be, as fools or idiots or evildoers. If you agree with the author's point of view and just want that reinforced, you may like this book and not see a problem. If you really want a fair and comprehensive exploration of some of this issues, something that makes you think, maybe makes you take another look at both sides, you will have to look elsewhere."
1532,Sing You Home,1439102724,Jodi Picoult,Barnes and Noble,3.7,tarync,"I have to add my voice to those who already said that this book was a disappointment. Jodi has in the past written her stories with more balance and multidimensional characters. This book seemed to be a commentary on her own political agenda. I am a fairly conservative Catholic who believes gays have a right to civil unions and have known many wonderful lesbian parents. However,to stereotype gays as saints and Christians as closed minded haters is ridiculous. Shame on you Jodi - we expect better from you!! The music was awful, the singer mediocre. I can see that when someone achieves success in their career they start to believe that they can do ""anything"". My advice to Jodi is to reassess her writing and stop churing out the books, put in a little more effort. Your fans deserve your best or they will no longer buy your books."

I don't mind the change of pace, though the story itself seemed to fall short of my expectations.  It certainly was not all bad, I actually found it rather enjoyable.  In fact the more I read, the more I enjoyed it.  Think of it as a ""snowball effect,"" very slow starter.  There were even times when I made myself read it though I didn't want to.  By the time I was 3/4 through it I found it difficult to put down, all with a rather satisfying ending.  If you enjoyed the chronicles, give this a read, it's Lestat in a whole new light."

The first 2 books were amazing and so is this one. It only took me 4 days to read i couldnt put it down. If u havnt read the maximum ride series yet you definetly should. It is action packed with thrilling adventures that will keep you glued to the book. There are no boring parts in this like there are in some others."
1535,"Saving the World and Other Extreme Sports (Maximum Ride, #3)",0316155608,James Patterson,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Allicine,"I remember, back in good 'ol 2008, when my awesome SAGE teacher told her class, me included, about a book called Maximum Ride.  I listened as she described it, and built myself a mental picture of the story.  I thought, Okay.  It sounds like a good book.
Then I read it.
And absolutely, positively fell head-over-heels in love with it.
It even beat out the Twilight series and Harry Potter!  In the course of twenty-four hours, I inhaled The Angel Experiment.  The next day, I had to read the next one!  That day passed and I was done with School's Out- Forever, then another day and I'd finished Saving the World and Other Extreme Sports.
Saving the World is definitely in my top-three Maximum Ride book list.  It was suspenseful and absorbing, and I never got bored with it.  Max and her flock of human-avian hybrid kids had their backs against a wall, yet again.  The School, the executions, retirement getting a totally new and gruesome meaning, Angel the traitor, Jeb, the whitecoats, escape becoming more valuable each day, yet becoming also more impossible-
But I've said too much.
The plot itself has so many possibilities.  I'm glad James Patterson was the author to take on this novel.  He's good with this kind of thing, and I can't see the characters any other way.  They make a very big impact on the story, their personalitites alone, and on their readers.  So many climaxes, it's almost impossible to call one the most surprising.  Death and destruction is at every turn, and all this is simply the basis for Patterson's work.  Bravo.
I can almost feel their adrenaline, feel their pain, the wind in their hair and faces, the sun on their skin, the pain the whitecoats put them through, the aching in their wounds and hearts when they see Jeb, and the suspense atmosphere is totally impossible to miss.  It's like you're there with the flock.  Like you're in the flock.  Amazing.  That's not even close to enough to describe it.
One of my favorite things about Maximum Ride is the characters.  They're good role models for children most of the time, and they amaze me.  The flock is full-blooded and three-dimensional.  They seem so real, like I could go out and meet Max and the flock.  They're tough and strong, sarcastic, witty, interesting, hilarious, laugh-out-loud riots, but they're down to earth if you can see them as just normal people.  They're a much-needed break from today's so-so drama/comedy that everyone in America bores themselves with nowadays.
What I love about Maximum Ride as a book and Max herself, as a character, or a person, is that she's different.  She's not like any other fourteen-year-old girl in the world.  Not just because of the whole mutant-experiment thing, but she's different.  She doesn't care about the newest clothing line coming out this season, or having the newest cell phone on sale today, and definitely not her hair.  She worried mostly about a) Saving the world.  b) Keeping her flock safe.  c) Surving.  Everything else can wait.
It's hard for me to describe this myself and totally capture the essence of Maximum Ride.  It's better to experience it first hand.  What are you waiting for?  Grab a copy of Saving the World and Other Extreme Sports and read it!  You'll see what I'm talking about."
1535,"Saving the World and Other Extreme Sports (Maximum Ride, #3)",0316155608,James Patterson,Barnes and Noble,4.6,bczwr2,"Before I read this book, I heard a lot of news that this book is hard to put down.

Verna's character is more confident and I like her so much more in this book! If this is supposed to be one of the low points in the series then I'm definitely reading all of them!

What a ghastly picture of him. This book was fabulous. Doubt if you see this on ""Tudors"", but indeed this is a part of English History you may not have heard of, at least I didn't. Ms. Gregory is exceptional in taking you to the many castle of the King, and especially the ""Tower"". This is a must for anyone interested in Tudor history. The author has set up the book so that each chapter is narrated by a different woman, and tied in to each other brilliantly. Hold onto your head!"
1537,"The Boleyn Inheritance (The Plantagenet and Tudor Novels, #10)",0743272501,Philippa Gregory,Barnes and Noble,4.2,HasadaAmin,"I couldn't put this book down. The Boleyn Inheritance follows three very different women, two wives of Henry VIII and the widow of George Boleyn, Anne Boleyn's brother who was executed for incest and treason-on the evidence given by his own wife. Anne of Cleves is the plain but honest, brave, and kind hearted wife brought in to marry Henry on recommendation of Secretary Cromwell. She is a Lutheran and Cromwell hopes to encourage Henry further towards Protestantism. But after their disasterous meeting at Rochester, where the old and vain king foolishly presented himself in the unflattering guise of an ordinary man and was repulsed by Anne, the marriage was doomed. Henry, pride wounded, determines to hate Anne no matter what she does to please him. He then falls in lust with Anne's maid Katherine Howard, who was brought to court by none other than the nefarious schemer the Duke of Norfolk, Anne Boleyn's wicked uncle. Katherine-Anne Boleyn's cousin-is silly, beautiful, and with a vanity that rivals Henry's own but none of his shrewd intellegence. She is a pawn used by Norfolk, who seizes on the King's hatred of Anne of Cleves and pushes Katherine forward in hopes to play the Queenmaker once more. But a girl of fourteen will fall in love, and as Gregory tells us, &quot;Never with a husband of forty-nine.&quot; With the King losing his vigor, the Duke of Norfolk next pushes the naive Katherine into the arms of a groom of the chamber, setting her on a dangerous path. Norfolk's other pawn in this is Jane Rochford, George Boleyn's widow and possible Gregory's most brilliantly created character.
Historically, Jane Rochford is perhaps one of Europe's most despised women. Her name is &quot;a byword for jealous and twisted lust&quot;, and Gregory depicts Jane's mental decline with skill, intriguing and horrifying the reader at once. Those who do not know Lady Rochford will meet her and think she is no more than a grieving young widow trying to make her way back into the world. But slowly, Jane's protestations of love for her husband and sister-in-law give way to excuses, and finally when pressed, the truth of what Jane did to George and Anne Boleyn-and why-comes to light. The Duke of Norfolk skillfully manipulates a deteriorating Jane into doing his dirty work with Katherine Howard, and so when yet another of Henry's Queens falls into peril, his hands are clean. Many will think that Jane gets just what she deserves!
Philippa Gregory handles the difficult task of writing a credible and gripping novel using three seperate narrators: Jane, Anne, and Katherine. Three distinct personalities are shown, and Gregory develops each masterfully. Gregory's portrayal  of Henry VIII is less than flattering, and in some cases downright disgusting. All in all, The Boleyn Inheritance is bold, brilliant, like a gossipy friend who you cannot get enough of. I highly recommend this book."
1537,"The Boleyn Inheritance (The Plantagenet and Tudor Novels, #10)",0743272501,Philippa Gregory,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Alle_Berry,"The Boleyn Inheritance is the second I've read of Gregory's works, after The Other Boleyn Girl. For years, I have hesitated to read any of the 'historical fiction' novels written by Gregory and other authors like her (Anne Easter Smith, Vanora Bennett, Alison Weir, etc), but I sure am kicking myself now for waiting so long to give them a chance! Gregory's writing style is effortless and addicting, and she does a fantastic job creating unique and interesting characters. This book, like most of her others, is written from the point of view of three different characters. Gregory does a great job varying her writing so that you can easily tell which character's point of view you are experiencing, even without reading the chapter title that tells which character is narrating. I appreciate that the chapters are relatively short, because it makes it so much easier to fit reading into my busy lifestyle. Overall, I very much enjoyed The Boleyn Inheritance, and I am looking forward to reading many more by this author!"

This book is dreary, dark, boring, and left me feeling empty and &quot;blue&quot;.  Ms Tyler's extraordinary  talent usually  lies in her uncanny ability to make the mundane relevant, important and interesting.  Unfortunately,  those talents were not achieved  in this book. The potential for captivating  and memorable characters was never developed.  They were merely cardboard cutouts,  lacking depth and motivation and likability.  They seemed to be representations of different attributes and beliefs, simple extremes that were never fleshed out  and made appealing. It was impossible to an form  attachment.....or even like.....any of them.   I plowed through the book, hoping it would get better, but it never did.

However did not  like the writing style. The book was confusing at points with too many names etc. Further it just drops you at the end with no real conclusion.
1539,The Underground Railroad,0385542364,Colson Whitehead,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Daenel,"This is not a book that you like or dislike. This is a book that you read, put down, and think about for days on end. The subject is sensitive and the topics are still relevant today: violence against women/men, racism and the way it impacts all people, silence/{in}action in the face of injustice, education, and the idea of freedom.

The characters were well written, sympathetic {when they needed to be} and monstrous {when expected}. I found myself invested in the characters. I didn't want to know just about the black characters, but the white characters as well. And Whitehead delivered. I liked the way he gave the characters a history and wrapped up each character's story without it being contrived or forced.

I know some folks are bothered by the fact that Whitehead uses a literal underground railroad as the transportation system for escaped slaves versus a metaphorical one. I don't have a problem with this. This is a novel, not a history book, so I expect the author to use a bit of literary license. In fact, I would say that the idea of an actual underground railroad enhances the feelings of fear and anxiety about the known and unknown worlds that {escaped} slaves inhabited.

This book does contain some violence, some of it is graphic {and sexual in nature}, but given the topic, that is to be expected. To show how engrossed I was in the story, I don't recall there being any harsh or coarse language, so if there was any it was used to propel the story and not just as a filler.

I would recommend this book for discussion groups and literature classes. There is so much to unpack in this story that I'm afraid my review can't do it justice, but if you do read it, I'd love to discuss it with you."

But that doesn't stop them from partying in this second installment of Melissa de la Cruz's fantasy/horror series, which has even more mysterious secrets and action than its predecessor.  Schuyler Van Alen goes to Venice in search of her grandfather, Lawrence Van Alen whom she believes can help solve the mystery of the Silver Bloods, a deviant branch of vampires intent on destroying young Blue Bloods. Back in Manhattan, preparations are in full-swing for the Four Hundred Ball, the elite event for vampires only. We are re-introduced to familiar characters such as Jack and Mimi Force, the immortal twins, Bliss Llewellyn, Oliver Perry [Schuyler's conduit], and some new ones like Kingsley Martin, the new boy. I thought this was a better plotted novel than the first...there's more intrigue, and also a lot more elaboration on what makes the Blue Bloods tick, i.e. their abilities, the training that goes into the young Blue Bloods, their weaknesses and of course the partial unravelling of the mystery of the Sivler Bloods. Schuyler Van Alen's character is more well-defined here, and her relationships with Oliver and Jack are explored in more depth in this novel though with no real resolution. There is a lot more that needs to be explained, and I guess that's to be found in the third novel, Revelations."

These books are great vampire series that will keep the reader wanting for more. Schuyler van Allen is a great leading character especially in this book. She has to deal and make major decisionsin her life.In Masquerade, theirs so many turns that kept me hook. Van Allen is very determined to find the silver bloods. She also learns more about what kind of powers she has as a half human, half vampire. The book has a lot of good parts since theirs so many secrets reveiled that as a reader one would've never guessed. Melissa de le Cruz creates many situations in the book where the reader has to predict who are the silver bloods, She provides the reader with great clues of who is the silver bloods. This book is also a love story. In this book the reader gets to read how Schuyler and Jack's feelings for each other grows. Jack's true feelings for Schuyler are revealed in this book. Not to mention the end of the book many secrets are reveiled about Schuyler and other characters.I really liked the end of the book for many reasons. The end grabbed my attention so much. After i was done reading i wanted to read the third. i can't wait to read the third book in the series and find out what's going to happen between Jack, Schuyler, Bliss, Oliver and the Silver bloods."

Then when i started reading it i couldnt put in down. I found out that after i read it that it was actually the second book of the series and not the first. it didnt matter though because I was still pulled in. This isnt like the other vampire stories you read today or see in movies. It gives us a side of vampires that keeps you in the story and wanting more. Sky is a great main character, she has traits that everyone can relate to. The love story in this book was so great between sky and jack. Its a must read and after you read it you'll want to read it over and over again. :)"

1541,"The Iron Queen (The Iron Fey, #3)",0373210183,Julie Kagawa,Barnes and Noble,4.6,danibookworm91,"I did not think there was anyway Julie Kagawa could top the previous book in the Iron Fey series, but Iron Queen blew me away and exceeded all expectations I had. Iron Queen was, by far, the best book in the entire Iron Fey series!

I am going to start off by saying that this review is going to be spoiler free so I am going to stay away from anything plot related because I am worried any little thing I say could be spoilery and I do not want to ruin this book for anyone.

This book was beyond awesome. If I could give it more than 5 stars I would. I sat down to read Iron Queen and could not stop reading it until I had finished reading the book. I forgot the enormous pile of homework I should have been doing and was sucked completely into the story of Iron Queen.

Julie Kagawa has written a fabulous third novel. All the favorite characters are back and put through so many twists and turns. The plot was amazing. Reading this book for me was like watching an amazing movie. I could literally picture every scene playing out in my head. There was great action scene too, of some epic portions. The plot had so many twists and turns I had no idea what was going to happen next. Julie Kagawa had me constantly on my toes, unsure what was going to happen to Meaghan, Ash and Puck next.

One of my favorite things about this third book in the Iron Fey series is that you can truly see how much each of the characters has grown. Meaghan has progressed so much as a character since the frighten, na&#239;ve girl with no knowledge of the Fey realm into this knowledgeable, strong, driven character. I loved seeing her come into her own and taking control. Ash and Puck have also grown as characters and I loved their growth and its amazing to see where Julie Kagawa has taken all these characters from Iron King to now in the Iron Queen

I really do not know how to describe this book. Julie Kagawa blew me away. I though the Iron Daughter was emotional rollercoaster, but it was nothing compared to this book. I was literally all over the place with emotion. I'm just going to say, I did cry during this book. And the ending. The ending was everything I expected from Julie Kagawa, full blown, emotion packed ending that left me dying for more.

The ending left me desperately waiting for Iron Knight. I am so glad this is not the final book and that the story is going to continue because it just needs too. I do not want to leave this fabulous world that Julie Kagawa has created. Iron Knight needs to be out now because that ending, in my opinion, was so much worse than Iron Daughter, and that had me driven mad that I could read the next one immediately.

Iron Queen was a beautiful masterpiece of a book. Truly wonderful. I really have no other words to describe it. It was simply, and purely, amazing."
1541,"The Iron Queen (The Iron Fey, #3)",0373210183,Julie Kagawa,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Cariblogs,"The intensity of this book was at an all time high. Your heart has to be made of iron to not fall in love with this series. In The Iron Daughter, Meghan, Ash, and Puck saved the specter but lost a friend to battle. When they returned to Faery both Winter and Summer made them choose to return to their court or be exiled if they chose to be together. When we begin The Iron Queen Ash and Meghan both chose exile than to be apart. [Ash I love you!] Meghan also discovers that the memory she traded in The Iron King was important and her first mission is to get it back. Ash is willing to do anything to make Meghan happy that he even talks about marrying her someday, if that's what she wishes. [Ash I love you so much!] Seriously these outbursts are what happened as I was reading The Iron Queen.

With each minute that passes Faery is dying and the false Iron King is hunting Meghan in the human world. Trust me when I say there is never a dull moment. In the back of Meghan's mind she knows that one day she will have to kill the False King, but to be successful she might have to sacrifice it all. Once Meghan realizes what she lost in her memory she seeks refuge with Leanansidhe, Queen of the Exile. While there she finds out that Puck disobeyed Oberon and went after Meghan so the team is back together. Meghan spends her time getting to know someone from her past and training with Ash for the day she will face the False King. If I was Meghan I would have wanted to live in this part of the story forever.

Winter and Summer come to realize that Meghan is their only hope to save Faery and send for her to help save what is left of Faery. As before Ash and Puck will not let her go alone and know that spending time in the Iron Relm will kill them. There are intense battles, sacrifices, broken hearts, and an ending I would never have guessed. I was crying for hours after I finished this book. Trust me when I say this book lives up to the hype. If you loved City of Glass, Mockingjay, Ink Exchange, the battles in Lord of the Rings than this book is for you. Just fair warning there will be intense sadness. Julie joins my top fey authors along Maggie Stiefvater, Melissa Marr, and Holly Black. The only reason this book did not get a 5 star is because I was so heart broken by the ending."

In this case you should! 

This was a quick read. It grabs you immediately and keeps a steady pace all the way through.i am usually upset when books are this short but for this one it worked. I felt like we got enough of Bliss and Garrick with there being plenty of room for the supporting characters (oh Cade!). I loved seeing Bliss grow over the course of the book. And how her relationship with Garrick developed. And there is enough steam between the two without it being overdone (not that I don't LOVE my hot steamy books but sometimes it is nice just to have the hint of it, ya know?!). 

This is a great debut novel for Ms. Carmack and I look forward to reading her future work"

1543,The Racketeer,0385535144,John Grisham,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Anonymous,"John Grisham's books are becoming as boring as James Patterson's.  I didn't like the lead character from the beginning--alternated between being whiney or slimey.  And it became very obvious early on that he knew way too much about circumventing the law than then simple small town lawyer he claimed to be.  This could have been a good book, but was not written with the suspense of Grisham's earlier books.  By the end of the book I didn't like any of the characters and only finished the book to finally get closure on what had become an obvious ending."
1544,Disgrace,0143036378,J.M. Coetzee,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"J.M. Coetzee's 'Disgrace' is a complex and moving tale about a middle-aged professor who realizes that his best days are behind him.  Like many men who go through a mid-life crisis, he tries to convince himself that he is still full of desire and passion and that women still find him desirable.  'Disgrace,' however, is about much more than a man who simply fears growing old.  It is also a commentary on social relations between people:  between men and women, father and daughter, races, cultures, lifestyles, and of the social structures in post apartheid South Africa.  The novel's protagonist, David Lurie, goes on a journey to rediscover who he is and to find meaning in his life.  What he discovers and doesn't discover about life is for the reader to figure out.  'Disgrace' is a very compelling and well-written novel by an author at the top of his form.  Coetzee's characterizations and witty dialogue are, in particular, to be commended."
1544,Disgrace,0143036378,J.M. Coetzee,Barnes and Noble,3.9,cheeriosLS,I enjoyed reading Disgrace and took it slow not wanting to miss a thing.  Coetzee is a powerful writer who doesn't beat around the bush with long drawn out sentences.  He writes with integrity and courage.  The 220 pages were packed with grim truth and intelligent potency.
1544,Disgrace,0143036378,J.M. Coetzee,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Whitegold,"To those unfamiliar with South African writer J.M. Coetzee, DISGRACE is a powerful introduction to this Nobel Prize and two-time Booker Prize-winning author.  In the best tradition of those writers who seem to chisel their words with great care -- in order to elicit the most meaning and effect -- Coetzee has fashioned a modern gem that challenges readers to explore themes and issues they might find disturbing and difficult to confront: sexuality, retribution, racial tensions, generational conflict, violence, human indifference, and profound shame.  Amid all these strifes, at its core DISGRACE is about forgiveness -- a forgiveness that many Americans and other Westerners could find hard to understand.  In the end, ""disgraced"" Professor David Lurie and his shareholding daughter are forced to confront their most basic and brutal personal tragedy in the larger context of an equally violent societal holocaust -- and somehow make their separate peace.  DISGRACE is one of those books that lives with you long after the last page is turned, and in your hearts of hearts you know you must revisit again."

1546,"The Black Prism (Lightbringer, #1)",0316075558,Brent Weeks,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Ruthven,"This book is perfect evidence that Brent weeks is an ever improving master of his trade. The Black Prism, the opening novel for the Light Bringer series, might just be Weeks' finest work yet. This looks to be even better than the Night Angel Trilogy (which is possibly the greatest modern fantasy series out there). Weeks creates a unique and imaginative world. His characters will be loved or hated, but never forgotten. His plot is a roller coaster full of twists, turns, and shocking revelations. This is a book you will not want to miss.

ps: If you have not read the Night Angel trilogy, GO READ IT NOW!!!"
1546,"The Black Prism (Lightbringer, #1)",0316075558,Brent Weeks,Barnes and Noble,4.5,hungryturnip,"Ok first off, this is a good book, original and compelling. Really the only reason why I don't give this five starts is that I just finished reading the Night Angel Trilogy by Brent Weeks, which I absolutely loved. Because this book is slower and the action less frequent, it seemed pretty slow at first, and even debated not finishing. But the pace picked up toward the latter quarter of the book, and when I finished it I decided I liked it. 

I think this may be the first in a multi-book series, and Weeks spent a lot of time setting up the world in this book, hence my reaction of it being slow at first.

I do recommend reading this, but not after reading a fast-paced action series like I did."
1546,"The Black Prism (Lightbringer, #1)",0316075558,Brent Weeks,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Threasa Bronson,I was a little apprehensive about this one as it sounded a little to mystical for my tastes but it had the perfect balance between lore and action. Also if you've read other books by Weeks then you know what to expect. In my case that was getting into one charcters story line then having it switch on me. Endlessly frustrating at the beginning but the story it weaves by doing it is more than worth it.
1547,The Mermaid Chair,0143036696,Sue Monk Kidd,Barnes and Noble,3.1,KourtneyH,"In The Mermaid Chair, Sue Monk Kidd does for fiction what the Flemish masters did for painting. She imbues each scene with so much reality it unfolds in your mind like a memory.

You can taste the salty sea air and smell the murky island scents of Egret Island. You feel every horrific and blessed thing that Jessie experiences.

I have never fallen so completely in love with a book before. Her writing is beyond beautiful. It¿s startling and humbling. I found myself nodding and rereading lines, thinking YES that is exactly how it feels but how did she capture it so perfectly?

The book is brimming with brilliance. Some of my favorite lines are:

¿The mind is so good at revising reality to suit its needs.¿

¿There¿s release in knowing the truth no matter how anguishing it is.¿

¿Sometimes the heart wanted what the soul demanded.¿

The story felt like a mid-life crisis crossed with a finding oneself journey.

Sue Monk Kidd¿s website describes the story as ¿the transendent tale explores the lush, unknown region of the feminine soul where the thin line between the spiritual and the erotic exists. Here is an unforgettable love story, between a woman and a monk, a woman and her family, and ultimately a woman and her own soul.¿

I think of it as a spiritual journey that leaves Jessie and the reader forever changed by calling into question the bonds of love and commitment. By reminding us that everything is a choice. Whether to leave a husband, to reunite with a parent, to be fully alive.

Sue Monk Kidd is a master of the writing craft. Her ability to set the scene is breathtaking and realistic. Her dialogue is poignant. Her character¿s internal thoughts vivid and engaging. There was not one point in the book where I wanted to put it down. Every aspect of the writing was engaging. I will be rereading this book for years to come, hoping to gain insight into how she does it."

Wow!!  There is more intrigue than the Gallagher Girls series she has written before, and way more cool toys than a James Bond thriller.  Kat Bishop is a girl you would want as your best friend.  Not only could she keep you out of trouble, she could add to your art collection.   There are cute guys, great characters, and a story that really has its roots in history, and is very touching.

Her enrollment lasts a few months before her old life comes crashing in on her and her plans.

She's framed for a prank she didn't commit, but that will nonetheless result in her expulsion from school. Quickly she realizes this dismissal is the work of an old family friend. He's here to tell her that her master thief father needs her help.

Turns out her father's been set up, too. Only the consequences are nowhere near as soft as being kicked out of boarding school.

Kat secretly meets her father's deadly enemy and works out a deal. She has two weeks to find the paintings and steal them back. If successful, it will be the biggest job she'll ever pull off - and also the most dangerous. Can she do it?

I adore THE GALLAGHER GIRLS series, but this new series may be even better. HEIST SOCIETY is my new favorite book. The combination of finding the art, the major heist, saving a relative, and going against the family makes for a thrilling, edge-of-your-seat read."

1552,"The Killer Angels (The Civil War Trilogy, #2)",0345348109,Michael Shaara,Barnes and Noble,4.3,SWA7X,"The Killer Angels written by Michael Shaara, is a very interesting book that describes the Civil War in vivid detail, specifically the Battle of Gettysburg. If you are an individual who is enthusiastic about learning about our nation's history and past, then it will be a great choice to purchase this book. In addition, this book is, for the most part, historically accurate, and will create an image in your mind of the landscape and the various skirmishes it details. Ever since I visited Gettysburg myself, I have had a passion for understanding and learning more about the battle itself, and I feel that this book has enhanced my knowledge of it and given me a new perspective on the events leading up to, and after, the battle.
	I really enjoyed the way in which Shaara used the point of view of multiple characters throughout the story, on both sides of the war, to truly involve the reader in the feeling and emotions of both the Union and the Confederacy, and allow the reader to view their perspectives in terms of the reasoning behind their judgments and reasons for being involved in such a war. When detailing a major historical event such as the Battle of Gettysburg, numbers and statistics are not always the best way to involve a reader, which is why Shaara presented the story from the perspective of a single soldier or general on either side of the war, to allow the reader to experience what the individual had felt and thought. When a reader becomes emotionally involved in a book, they are more apt to have a greater understanding of the material within, and have a much better overall experience in reading the story. I enjoyed the book because I became somewhat emotionally involved, and I greatly enjoyed the presentation of the Battle of Gettysburg through several different perspectives and points of view.
	In the case of any historically significant book that has conflicting points of interest, there is bound to be some sort of bias or historical inaccuracy, and the latter of which is present in this book. One major historical inaccuracy in the book is that Shaara detailed that the 20th Maine brigade of the Union army was present to defend General Pickett's charge. According to several historians, the 20th Maine brigade was defending the Union's left flank, and could not have defended against Pickett's charge, which brings forth the presence of a historical discrepancy. I believe that Shaara portrayed the 20th Maine defending against Pickett's charge to add appeal and zest to the story. The presence of a historical discrepancy did not detract from the overall detail and meaning of the book, however it did slightly detract from the point in the plot detailing Pickett's charge.
	Overall, I enjoyed this book and I would recommend it to anyone who has a desire to learn about the Civil War, The Battle of Gettysburg, or any of the significant military leaders. The way in which Shaara presented the information about the logistics of the Battle of Gettysburg through various viewpoints and perspectives greatly interested me, and allowed me to become very involved with the book, which is why I finished it in two days. 
	I would recommend this book to an audience of individuals who are mature enough to handle the violence and loss of life that the story entails, and are conscious enough to keep up with the multiple story lines."
1552,"The Killer Angels (The Civil War Trilogy, #2)",0345348109,Michael Shaara,Barnes and Noble,4.3,drjei,"I didn't know what to expect from this book- probably got it for my nook based on the overall rating given by others.  I have been to Gettysburg, but it has been years, and I was tired and hot when I went, so didn't get much of a feel for it.  
This book changed all that.  The unique approach of looking at the war from the different soldiers/generals perspective was refreshing and thought-provoking.  The conflicting emotions of the southern leaders of wanting to fight for their homes and lifestyle vs. the guilt of fighting against dear friends from earlier times was presented in a striking way.  
I found myself looking for times I could read this book over lunch at work, while waiting for my next appointment, etc.  It kept me up late, and gave me things to think about throughout the day.  
All in all, I'd love to read this book again just before going to visit Gettysburg.  I think it would be a profound experience."

1554,"Ptolemy's Gate (Bartimaeus, #3)",0786818611,Jonathan Stroud,Barnes and Noble,4.6,TeensReadToo,"He's back! But this time around, the smart-mouthed djinni, Bartimaeus, is exhausted from too much work and not enough time to recover in his netherworld home. It's like they always say, ""All work and no play makes Bartimaeus a dull supernatural being."" Although, in this case, he's anything but dull. He's tired, weak, sharp-tongued, homicidal, and insulting. But definitely not dull. In this third installment of THE BARTIMAEUS TRILOGY, the hero is again a djinni who has little respect for humans and even less interest in their petty wars and government squabbles. The magicians who rule England in this series of books insist on summoning Bartimaeus and scores of other demons to fight their wars, provide magical assistance of all sorts, and generally do their bidding. The demons see this treatment as slavery, and for good reason. What would you call forced servitude for no pay under threat of intense pain? PTOLEMY'S GATE opens to find poor Bartimaeus stretched to the breaking point by his magician master, Nathaniel. A war in America is going poorly, the commoners of London are growing tired of the ruling class of magicians, and young Nathaniel is looked upon with jealousy and mistrust by his co-workers. As a result of all of these threats, Nathaniel rationalizes the need to keep Bartimaeus around to help him deal with the many problems that he faces. After a long association with the djinni, it is almost as if Nathaniel trusts his reluctant servant. And it is almost as if Bartimaeus has a shred of concern for human dealings. Almost. PTOLEMY'S GATE is an excellent capstone to the extraordinary Bartimaeus series. I enjoyed all of these books immensely and recommend them to anyone who enjoys young adult fantasy. Like the first two books, THE AMULET OF SAMARKAND and THE GOLEM'S EYE, this one is filled with humor and excitement. These books also offer some social commentary for those who want to pay attention to such things. For example, the ruling class of magicians in these books take extreme measures to maintain their own positions, while claiming that they are really just interested in keeping the masses safe. There are resistance groups that oppose the government, and they engage in acts of terrorism to free themselves from the magicians' oppressive yoke. The entiretrilogy is a fun-filled pleasure to read. Doubtless it would be possible to read PTOLEMY'S GATE without having read the previous two books, but I would not recommend it. There is quite a bit of background that would be missed, and the story would definitely suffer. While the first book in the series, THE AMULET OF SAMARKAND, could probably stand alone, the second two (THE GOLEM'S EYE and PTOLEMY'S GATE) should be read together. And once the last page of PTOLEMY'S GATE is turned, readers will undoubtedly wish they could summon Bartimaeus back for more."
1554,"Ptolemy's Gate (Bartimaeus, #3)",0786818611,Jonathan Stroud,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Ralnon,"I am deeply impressed by Mr. Stroud's masterpiece work in his writing, and I sincerely applaud him for it. I myself have read it over and over again, and I am moved by some parts of the story, horrified at others, yet awed by all parts. How could Jonathan surpass this trilogy with another?; I myself personally yearn for another series, yet I know not even Stroud can exceed it with what he has already wrought about. I myself find it a fitting and wonderful conclusion, with many twists, tragedies and moments both touching and suspenseful. Stroud has clearly proven he is a master of English, yet also has a firm grasp of humor, excitement and modern society too, which is also evident and appealing. I thank Mr. Stroud for bringing this marvel to us all, and once again I applaud him for this novel and series!"

1555,The Island of Dr. Moreau,0553214322,H.G. Wells,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"A very nice effort by H.G. Wells. This is a quick read that would be ideal for boys ages 13 and up. The tale is about Dr. Moreau, a scientist, who has been forced out of England for his strange experiments. His experiments consist of taking animals and through surgical processes giving them human like intelligence and form. However, his creations are imperfect and it is these imperfections that help cause his downfall. Fast paced and full of action. Also, on a deeper level it makes you think if there are places science should not travel. Moreau played God. Are we doing the same today with cloning, for example? These connections make the book very current."
1555,The Island of Dr. Moreau,0553214322,H.G. Wells,Barnes and Noble,4,Janus,"Undoubtedly, H.G. Wells was a man who was years ahead of his time. Like Huxley, he seems to have anticipated the issues surrounding genetic manipulation years before such a thing was even a topic. As a book, The Island of Dr. Moreau reads like a slightly less stuffy gothic horror novel. While the characters may seem slightly cookie cutter for the genre (especially the doctor and the narrator) they all have slight quirks that set them apart from the normal lot. Each chapter is only about seven pages long and the story reads quickly. I can see how a really neat movie could be made from this, but nobody has succeeded yet (the version with Brando and Kilmer...ouch). For someone looking for a good 'abandoned on an island' type story, this is a really good one."
1555,The Island of Dr. Moreau,0553214322,H.G. Wells,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,I thought the Island of Dr. Moreau was an excellent book to read.  It was very imaginative and interesting. I would recommend for anyone to read this H.G. Wells classic but only if you like sci-fi. Otherwise it is not the book for you.
1556,"Opal (Lux, #3)",1620610094,Jennifer L. Armentrout,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Cupcakegirly,"When you slice up a birthday cake you usually scrape the knife off between each slice otherwise the pieces look messy and unappetizing when you serve it. By the time you're finished there's a pile of leftover frosting and cake bits on the plate that a lot of people throw away, but not me. That happens to be my favorite part of the cake, right behind the corner piece, you know, the one will all the frosting? If you're wondering what any of this has to do with Opal, just hold your Luxen, I'm getting there. *winks* I was so.very.excited to read this, I mean, it is Daemon Black we're talking about but you add Dawson to the mix and it's like scoring the corner piece of birthday cake AND getting to lick the plate it was served on. (Now I want cake.) I thoroughly enjoy Jennifer's writing style and she has a way of giving readers what they want, maybe not at the exact moment they want it, but just when we need it. Opal picks up where Onyx leaves off and while it didn't move as quickly as the previous books that was totally OK because it lent some much needed time for adjusting to life with Dawson, healing, preparation for the fight ahead, and of course, kissing. These characters learn hard lessons about love, loss and exactly what it means to ""keep your friends close, and your enemies closer."" Dawson rarely speaks but it's painfully obvious he's racked with guilt and wants nothing more than to get Beth back. *hugs Dawson* Dee is harboring anger and hurt over Adam as well feeling betrayed by Katy and Daemon and her inability to be in the same room with Katy, let alone ""friends"" is hard for everyone. Daemon is torn between his feelings for Katy and his need to protect both she and Dawson and there are some truly heartbreaking moments for him. *clutches Daemon* Katy struggles with the changes that have happened to her over the past few months and the guilt she feels about being responsible for it all. She even begins to question her own humanity but Daemon does a great job of supporting and encouraging her. Now, if he would just say those three little words, you know, in English. *shakes him* Their scenes are definitely steamier than before *fans face* but as always, Jennifer keeps it classy. Everything builds up to this ending and while I had an idea of what would happen (there are a few clues scattered about) and I knew we wouldn't get another ""calm"" ending like with Onyx, I still...well, let's just say the Source really hit the fan and left me feeling all the feels. I can't wait to see how this all ends! Btw, If you don't fall in love with Daemon by the end of this book then I think it's safe to assume, you're either an Arum or a Zombie. And yes Dee, I know what happens when you ""assume"" things. ;D"

1556,"Opal (Lux, #3)",1620610094,Jennifer L. Armentrout,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Tam00,Best book in the series yet.  Can Not Wait For Origins.  What a cliffhanger at the end.  My only complaint is the cover models.  They don't match up the characters in my head.
1557,Zeitoun,1934781630,Dave Eggers,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"David Eggers records the horrific events that occur to Mr. Zeitoun and his family during and following Hurricane Katrina.  Mr. Zeitoun, a highly trusted and successful building contractor and manager in New Orleans, attempts to keep his properties safe during the catastrophic deluge that hits the Gulf Coast.  Sadly, Mr. Zeitoun is arrested and suffers grave mistreatment and endless indignities because he is a devout Muslim.  That he is a peaceful man, an honest businessman, a loving family man, means little to his jailers who stereotype him as a Middle Eastern threat. David Eggers describes in riveting detail the atrocities suffered by Mr. Zeitoun while in the hands of American soldiers.  That our country could resort to such lawless inhumanity is shocking, but that we have not heard the full story before is even more shocking.  It is every citizen's duty to read this book and to know what happened."
1557,Zeitoun,1934781630,Dave Eggers,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Dukhead,"While Zeitoun was an interesting story about a man who stayed behind during and through the aftermath of hurricane Katrina that it was lacking in components that make up a good story. Since the book was nonfiction I thought it was easy to find that the author was trying not to reveal too much in the beginning of the story so that readers would still be interested. While this is a god idea most of the time, it causes the story to slowly progress and puts off the reader from reading this book. He also dwelled a little too much in Zeitoun's past for my liking. He was constantly backtracking throughout the story and took to much time on his past. I also found it strange that he did not mention a lot about his son and in pictures of their family they do not include him. I believe he only mentions Zachary about 10 times in the story. And when he needs to get to school instead of taking him to school he is left to make breakfast and find a way to school on his own. Instead of taking Zachary to school they find it more important to take the daughters to school. Is he not important enough? I feel that he doesn't get enough attention because he isn't Zeitoun's real son. For the sake of Zachary I truly hope that this is not an actuality. Overall I thought this book had a good story but was not laid out very well at all."
1557,Zeitoun,1934781630,Dave Eggers,Barnes and Noble,4.1,fischettij,"When a man-made catastrophe met a natural disaster, the American Dream became an American nightmare. For the Zeitoun a low pressure center named Katrina exaggerated the bigotry and biases stirred by the events of 9-11.  For anyone who is Muslim and of Middle Eastern descent, the misguided hatred of the last ten years has brought untold suffering to Americans.  Dave Eggers successfully weaves the stories of a pending storm and a country in moral crisis.

This is a book that feels fiction in its telling, and the sobering truth is it is really true.  I am left saddened that this story is but one of many that could be told, if we wanted to hear about the America we currently are protecting with laws that take away freedom and rights that our forefathers and mothers died for us to enjoy."
1558,Out of My Mind,141697170X,Sharon M. Draper,Barnes and Noble,4.8,smaikens,"I was emotionally overwhelmed by Out of My Mind, a middle grade novel by Sharon Draper. This is the story of Melody, a 10 year old girl with Cerebral Palsy so severe that she can neither speak nor move independently. Trapped inside Melody's uncooperative body is a brilliant mind with a cutting wit. Melody is relegated to a classroom of special needs kids because she can't communicate & her teachers assume that she is also mentally handicapped. Her world suddenly opens up when she gets a computer with a voice program that allows her to speak. Unfortunately, the rest of the school is not ready to accept Melody. I cheered for Melody while I read this book as I sat at my kitchen table. The conversations she has with her parents and caregivers about being different are gut-wrenching. Melody knows exactly how she is perceived by other kids and adults, including teachers. The conversations between Melody's parents as they comtemplate the birth of their 2nd child moved me to tears. This is more than a book about a girl with special needs. It holds up a mirror for all of us to see how we react to people with disabilities that make us uncomfortable. I encourage everyone to read this."
1558,Out of My Mind,141697170X,Sharon M. Draper,Barnes and Noble,4.8,Flamingnet,"Imagine having a photographic memory, imagine being
extremely smart..... Well that's exactly how eleven year old
 Melody is except there is one problem, she can't talk or
walk. Every day she goes to school to a special class for
kids that have problems and every day they go over the
alphabet. For her, though, she is past just learning the
alphabet. Melody belongs in advanced classes but she has no
way of letting anyone know that. Doctors and experts
diagnosed her with cerebral palsy and insisted that she
wasn't capable of  learning. Little did they know she is
destined to prove them wrong. With a little help from a
friend and a lot of hope, Melody finds what she's been
looking for all her life. She will prove to the world what
she can  accomplish.

I've never read any of Sharon
Draper's books before, but what caught my eye on this book
was the cover. It is very interesting how the fish is
jumping out of its bowl and it goes very well with the
title. The characters were written very well and sometimes I
found myself getting frustrated with some of Melody's
problems. I started worrying if it would end okay.  Even
though it had some sad parts I really enjoyed reading Out of
My Mind. I would recommend this for kids 11 and
up.

1559,"Rapture (Fallen, #4)",0000000000,Lauren Kate,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"I bought a Nook to say money on the cost of books. I love J.R. Ward, but not enough to spend $14.99 on an e-book. If I'm going to spend that much money, I'll spend the extra on the hard cover. I still like the feel of holding a good book in my hands. If the cost of good authors continues to rise, I may have to go back to watching TV."
1559,"Rapture (Fallen, #4)",0000000000,Lauren Kate,Barnes and Noble,4.2,anita_63,"Rapture is another Fallen Angel novel that follows the battle between heaven and hell for seven chosen souls. Winner take all in this battle for the domination of the inhabitants of both heaven and earth. In this book, the soul in question is that of Matthias, who appeared in the book Crave. Does he deserve another chance at salvation? 
There is Mels Carmichael who literally runs into Matthias and the adventure begins. Their interaction and the mystery of Matthias&rsquo;s amnesia is the main topic in this book. We visit with the characters of the previous books as they battle for Matthias&rsquo;s soul. It a book about redemption. 
I recommend this book. I suggest that you read the previous books in order to understand what is really taking place in this book.  I love the Fallen Angel book series. J.R. Ward is an excellent author and I have loved every book she has written."

Especially while it isnt even from the BDB series. Fallen series is good but def not worth that kind of money. It makes me worry about how much they will ask for the next  BDB book. Ridiculous.

I bought it for my daughter originally, but chose to pre-read it first (that's my excuse and I'm sticking to it) I wound up falling in love with the book. It reminds me quite a bit of ""Twilight"" but is no where near as whiny or silly as sparkling vampires. 

The plot twists a bit (though it is fairly predictable at times) and keeps your attention throughout the chapters. If you haven't purchased the second book, expect to run out and do so as soon as you've finished the first!"

It is very detailed and can be confusing at times. It is not meant to be light reading!! It really makes you think about life and questions your beleifs. Keeping a list of all the characters and how they are connected is very helpful. This novel discusses the Russian government choices, religion, and morals. While reading this novel the author Boris Pasternak paints a perfect picture as to where the scenes take place and who the characters are. The writing style is very elegant and beautiful. At the back of the novel there are many poems that Paskernak wrote. When reading I felt as though I were actually feeling what the characters felt and saw. I highly recommend this novel!

The movie had a very different, and disappointing, ending so I read the book once more. Then I retired, we down-sizaed, and I had to depart with many of my books; Dr. Z was one of them.

1561,Doctor Zhivago,0679774386,"Boris Pasternak, Max Hayward, Manya Harari, John Bayley",Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,"Doctor Zhivago, written by Boris Pasternak, is a story about the turmoil of revolutionary Russia and its people.  It begins a few years before the Bolshevik Revolution and follows events that lead to Civil War and the establishment of the Soviet government.  The main character is Dr. Zhivago, a kind and passionate man, who is constantly affected by these events.  The book has excellent historical value as well as detail of its characters so that it fully embodies the disorderly mindset of the people.  This is most evident in Dr. Zhivago¿s relationship with a woman named Lara.  He and his wife Tonya were happily married but when he was drafted to a medical outpost he fell in love with the nurse Lara.  Though the Doctor is a good man he is torn between his two loves and inevitably cheats on Tonya.  His relationship with Lara beautifully parallels the political struggle that was taking place in Russia.  She represents the Communist Russia that the people longed for.  She is so close yet unattainable  every time the doctor begins to settle with her they experience pain and hardship, whether it be by outside forces or their own actions.  She is impossible to reach, impossible to forget, and their relationship, like the revolution, was impossible stop once it began.  Dr. Zhivago allows the reader to witness a struggle of the human mind¿s judgment and its desires.  It demonstrates that our decisions can start us in one direction and that life¿s unforeseeable circumstances can easily lead us astray."
1562,Confess,1476791457,Colleen Hoover,Barnes and Noble,4.6,BookBfReviews,"Do you have a secret you would like to confess?

This book....THIS BOOK!
I have tried for several days to put into perspective how this book has made me feel. I have been in a horrible reading slump. Nothing sounded good. Everything I picked up I put down. I wasn't feeling it, then this book. I admit I got the ARC a while ago but because I wasn't feeling anything I wasn't sure if Colleen could do her magic. 

Did she do her magic? Did she weave a tale so compelling that it brought me back into the book light?

YES! The answer is yes, yes, yes oh hell yes!

Going in I had no idea what to expect. All I know is that Colleen has a way with words and if I'm not careful I will get swept up into emotions so pure that I cry. 

From the jump its emotional. Its raw. It makes me hate how life can be so unfair. 

Auburn is a sweet girl who has gotten a crap turn at life. 
Owen is a great guy who also had a crap turn at life but now paints. What does he paint? Peoples confessions. 

People leave confessions in a slot in his door, he chooses a confession and paints it. I was astounded by the confessions. These are real confessions, while some of them were cute there were some that made me sad. 

Auburn meets Owen one day by chance, they just so happen to have the same middle name. Was it chance or fate? 

They have a connection, it made me giddy. Even though I had only known Owen for a few pages I loved him instantly. The way Colleen wrote this character is so unlike any other. Magnetism, charisma, charm I don't know what it is but I was drawn in. 

Auburn, this girl had me at times wishing I could slap her BUT I get why she was doing what she was doing. I hated it like really hated it. Oh and then there was this one scene that I had to calm down because I really wanted to hurt someone. Funny how fictional characters can get you so pissed you're on the verge of killing someone! well expect that.

What else can expect, you ask me? The usual stuff that you love from Colleen. You know the stuff that makes us love, then hate, then love her again. The stuff that breaks your heart, then mends it, then she laughs and say kidding, then breaks it again for good measure before deciding okay fine I will stop playing with your emotions. Then slowly she puts the needle through your broken heart and mends it back together very slowly because she can be cruel like that. Expect that and a lot of oh I see where you are going you trickster, then Colleen laughs diabolically and says really then throws you a curve ball. One you had no idea was coming, one so big that you look around the room in awe and shock because you can't believe she did that. 

This book was a great read. I don't know Colleen's recipes for her books but her mad genius shines through. She had me thinking the book was going a certain way then it ended up being nothing like I expected. The only thing I was sad about was the relationship between Owen and Auburn, I wanted more. I wanted more days and hours with them. I was satisfied beyond what I hoped. 

Thank you Colleen for once again coming through and pulling me out of that slump."
1562,Confess,1476791457,Colleen Hoover,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"I have the hardest time reading another author 's work after reading Colleen's. She makes everyone else's work seem mediocre. There are no words to describe this book. The simplest sentences are so moving and powerful! How does one move past this? Colleen, you are the reason I love reading!"
1562,Confess,1476791457,Colleen Hoover,Barnes and Noble,4.6,megankylene,"I jumped at the chance to read Confess when I saw it features an artist hero. Secrets, omission, and a little bit of fate are intertwined in this new adult romance novel about two people with pasts that they don&rsquo;t want to reveal to anyone. But they eventually reveal to each other, leaving the consequences scattered on the floor. While I thought this book was entertaining, it wasn&rsquo;t my favorite book by Colleen Hoover. I didn&rsquo;t get that &ldquo;oh my goodness I have to know what happens next&rdquo; that I look for when reading a really captivating book.
I will say that the prologue to this book was super, duper sad. I think that may have been my favorite part of the book, actually. After moving from Texas from Oregon, Auburn Reed is starting over on her own. She serendipitously sees a &ldquo;Help Wanted&rdquo; sign at a local art gallery called Confess owned by Owen Gentry. The two have an instant connection and there is some mysterious magnetism drawing them together. Little is revealed about their pasts. All we know is Auburn visited an attorney in chapter one (for what?) and Own knows Auburn from long ago (what the what?). After a few hours together, they don&rsquo;t want the night to end.
I started out really liking this book, but as I continued to read, I just got a little bored. Nothing was really happening with their relationship, not much was happening plot-wise. Confess lacked the same sort of spark that some of her other books had in the past. One thing I really like about Colleen Hoover&rsquo;s books is that her heroes are never super alpha, which aren&rsquo;t always my favorite type. Owen was a sweet guy whose past mistakes catch up with him.
The intensity of Auburn and Owen&rsquo;s relationship was way too fast-paced for me. Hoover was trying to sell me an instant attraction/connection between the hero and heroine, and while they had chemistry, I didn&rsquo;t truly feel their love connection. After a few hours together, both were nearly weeping at the fact that they had to part. I thought that maybe would be explained away later and tie into the fact that Owen knew Auburn from the past. Hoover has made this instant attraction work in past novels, but here something was lacking in Confess for the reader to believe it. I wanted more background for both of them, more development in terms of their relationship, before we dove into &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to see you again&rdquo; territory.

1563,"Pines (Wayward Pines, #1)",1469216000,Blake Crouch,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"Imagine you have just woken up in a cold sweat on the side of a river in the middle of nowhere. You have no memory of who you are and why you are there, even worse you have no belongings or forms of identification on you either. Finally once the state of dissolution fades away once finding your way into town, the memories of being a secret service agent on a mission to find two missing colleagues comes back into view. As you dig to find answers you began to uncover more questions on why this town Wayward Pines is putting up the fa&ccedil;ade of perfection. Soon your mission diverts from trying to find colleagues to trying to escape from Wayward Pines; however the chilling intuition that there is no way out begins to test your sanity as you embark on your new mission. This thrilling journey is the plotline for the book Pines. Pines by Blake Crouch is a book that once you pick up you will not be able to put down due to its unique plotline and unanticipated twists.
             The first thing that appeals to the readers senses in this book is how different the plotline is from other mysteries. Pines does an excellent job at creating a new, alternative world that allows for some magic to be brought into an otherwise hard hitting mystery. It has just a bit of a futuristic touch to make it different than reading just another Nancy Drew book that is just one out of hundreds. Although it does have a flare of imagination, it does not distract you from the real terror of what is happening in this seemingly perfect town and still instills that need to find answers within you. 
              	This book also makes you hungry for more by blind siding you with new, unexpected twists throughout every discovery. I have personally read many books where you could tell from a mile away what the hard hitting mystery was. Those kind of mysteries honestly made me set the book down to collect dust. However in Pines I was truly taken aback by how all of the clues linked together and was shocked at the end when you find out the truth behind the town and the main characters existence within it. Even a good NCIS episode could not top the twists in this book. Although a NCIS show can throw some curve balls, this book goes down a path that no one could have predicted while truly displaying originality that sets it apart from all other mysteries.
	              Overall,  Pines  by Blake Crouch is the perfect read for any young adult due to its unique plotline and unanticipated twists. The reader of this book will either be, drawn in by its futuristic and slightly magical overtone or engulfed into the story throughout each new twist. Once you have finished this book, do not fret for it is a part of a trilogy and I recommend you continue down its journey on to book two,  Wayward  by Blake Crouch."
1564,Disclosure,0099303744,Michael Crichton,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"I rediscovered this book recently when I went on a Michael   Crichton reading kick, I needed to get my fix.  I dusted off   all of my MC novels and after reading through so many of   them at once I decided to write a review on this work.    Reading this book after reading the other Crichton novels   I felt that though the inventiveness of the plot, and the   well developed characters were what I would expect from   Crichton, I was dissapointed with the lack of detail spent   in description of the goings on of the corporate world.    I felt as though Crichton, who is usually amazing in   regards to specificity, did not spend enough time on the   accuracy of the world in which the novel took place and as   a result it didn't strike the novel home for me.      The characters were very interesting though, poor   Sanders! The sexual harassment situation reminded me of   a book my wife just passed on to me called Manhook, by   Ken Ratcliffe.  It has a very dark, but very humorous view   of the corporate world and is worth a read if you liked this   novel.  I've also been into Harlan Coben a lot lately, The   Latest, is incredible."

1565,Death Comes to Pemberley,0307959856,P.D. James,Barnes and Noble,3.2,yowen2010,"Honestly, I am very disappointed in this novel. This is my first time reading anything by PD James but I am unhappy.  I LOVE Jane Austen and Pride and Prejudice is one of my all-time favorite novels. I feel like Austen's novel was tainted. ""Death comes to Pemberley"" was confusing, dull, and tedious. The only positive thing I can say was of the storyline.  The plot was interesting but it didn't materialize properly and was undeveloped. Also, Elizabeth,  the main character in Pride and Prejudice barely existed in James's novel.  The tone and manner of the novel was dull and hard to understand (I am an avid reader).  It was disheartening to say the least! No wonder Austen didn't want anyone using her novels in any way for use after her passing."
1565,Death Comes to Pemberley,0307959856,P.D. James,Barnes and Noble,3.2,MayaMA,"This was a terrific sequal and tells us what James thinks happened next. Add a mystery and you have a winner! I'm read most of James and all of Austen. In fact, have reread much of both. James captured the spirit of Austen with a Jamesian plot. One of the few books I have read cover to cover is almost one sitting."

1566,Ethan Frome,0142437808,Edith Wharton,Barnes and Noble,3.8,ILoveClassics,"I was very skeptical about reading this at first because I love a happy ending. However, Edith Wharton completely changed that with her stark and simple realism that left you thinking there was no better way to end this story than tragically. I read it in 1 sitting... and I think that's the only way to do it with this story! Even though Ethan's relationship with his wife's cousin is borderline immoral... Wharton is able to manipulate your emotions and actually make you feel compassion for these two lovers. I will read this story over and over!"
1566,Ethan Frome,0142437808,Edith Wharton,Barnes and Noble,3.8,TiBookChatter,"The story takes place in a nineteenth-century New England village. Ethan Frome is married to Zeena. Zeena has a great many problems. One of which is her ailing self. It's not clear if she is truly ill, of if her meanness just makes her so, but she is bedridden to the point of needing a helping hand. Mattie, her cousin, comes to help them out. 

As the three of them spend time together, it's clear that Ethan has fallen hard for Mattie. He secretly catches glimpses of her at the supper table, and finds excuses to be alone with her. Although he hopes that she feels the same way, it's hard to tell as first what Mattie is thinking. However, it's not hard to tell what Zeena is thinking and it's no surprise that she makes it difficult for them in the end. 

My frustration with this book is that there is really no honor to be had when it comes to Ethan. He loves Mattie, but he doesn't really act upon it in a realistic way. He sort of fumbles along and experiences moments of gushing that you'd expect from a young girl, not a grown man. I mentioned the honor part because it's not really out of a sense of honor that he is with his wife. It's as if he doesn't have the energy to live any differently. He puts up with her but I'm not sure why. Certainly not for money, as they are poor farmers and with her medical costs, there is nothing extra to be had. 

I wanted to feel something for Ethan, but I felt nothing. It was like downing a glass of wine and having it go right to your head. I was numb to his plight and I felt no pity for him. The end of the book, as seen through a third-party visitor to the house, has got to be one of the most depressing endings ever. 

Although I didn't love it, there is plenty to discuss. 

On a funny note, when I saw the cover above, I was thinking torrid love affair, a ""roll in the hay"" so to speak, but when you read the book you realize the cover has nothing to do with what my dirty, smutty mind was thinking. Too bad"
1566,Ethan Frome,0142437808,Edith Wharton,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Anonymous,"Ethan Frome is a tragic story that will manipulate and twist your emotions of what a good relationship is. Ethan and his sickly wife, Zeena, live in a bleak New England countryside. Zeena's younger cousin Mattie comes to help Ethan care for Zeena. Eventually, Mattie and Ethan begin to fall in love. All Ethan can do is think about Mattie and try to spend time with her. On one hand, you're inspired and touched by Ethan and Mattie's love and the hope for their future together, but you also feel bad for Zeena. The ending of the story is surprising and full of irony. This is a fast read, an interesting exploration in romance and relationships as we define them, and a tragic love story between even more tragic characters."

1568,It Ends with Us,0000000000,Colleen Hoover,Barnes and Noble,4.8,Anonymous,"THIS. BOOK. !!!!

If there was one book I wish I could unread and read all over again, this would be THE book. So many feels! So, so many. I went in blind. Although, I wouldn't have even guessed at this storyline if I had read the synopsis first. 

This will resonate with every reader regardless if you have been in the situation Lily, Ryle and Atlas (even Jenny) found themselves in. Everyone knows someone who, at least, knows someone who has.

I have never felt so strongly for characters in a book! I fell in love and I fell in hurt. I am so proud of Colleen Hoover! Which doesn't even make sense, I don't know her. I haven't watched her grow into the human she is today. I'm not part of her process. But I have so much pride in this person! 

I'm not an emotional person. There has been very few books that have made me tear up. But, THIS. BOOK. had me ugly crying in front of my husband, for at least a good 2 hours after I finished the VERY last page (don't skip the Authors Note!). 

How can this author continue to put out new material and it's always so genuine, so emotional, so different, so REAL?!!

If you can only afford 1 book, this is the book to spend your hard earned money on. This book will leave you reeling! This book will have you falling in love. In love with the storyline, in love with the plot twist, in love with the characters and the atmosphere, in love with... flowers and in love with This. Author. In love with yourself.

THIS. BOOK. !!!!"

It is a touching story about love and unselfishness, and especially relevant during the Christmas season.  Zwerger's illustrations are incredibly soft and flowing without sacrificing detail, bringing new dimension to this familiar story.  Although a picture book, the thought provoking themes of the story make this more appropriate for upper elementary and older.  I would recommend this as a good addition to a school library or public children's collection."

1570,The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test,0553380648,Tom Wolfe,Barnes and Noble,4.3,CameronWeber,"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test is a first-person dissertation of Ken Kesey and his band of Merry Pranksters. After Kesey wrote One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, he discovered the mystical experience of taking LSD (acid). In 1967, He and his Pranksters wanted to share this wonder with the rest of the world, so they bought a 1939 International Harvester school bus, painted it with day-glo, and they were off, traveling the country soaring on acid, speed, and grass. Tom Wolfe rode along on this journey, although he passed on the narcotics in order to bring his readers an accurate representation of their trip. His writing style is like nothing I have ever seen. He sometimes breaks into poems or uses large numbers of colons in succession. His thought process is all over the place and, at times, difficult to comprehend. Overall, I thought this was a GREAT book because it tells about how acid was introduced into mainstream America, and it shows an outsider's perspective of countless trips, highs, hallucinations, and lows. Anybody who has seen and liked The Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour would enjoy reading this book. They have similar themes, and The Beatles actually were inspired to make that movie because of the Merry Pranksters' adventure. I would rate The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test at 9.961 out of 10."
1570,The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test,0553380648,Tom Wolfe,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"Wow! this is most definately my favorite Tom Wolfe book, and probably my favorite book ever! the merry pranksters remind me of a greatful dead-esque typical 60's hippie group. even people born after the time of 'the hippies' (they're still everywhere in Berkeley!) can appreciate the descriptive and unique style of writing posessed by Tom Wolfe.This book gives intellectual qualities to a people thought to be the most unintelligent of their time. Trippy."

It often takes an outsider to recognize it, tie it all together and objectively capture it for posterity. Read Hunter Thompson's ""Hell's Angels"", Kerouacs ""On the Road"" and Wolfe's ""Electric Koolaid Acid Test"", and you have a front row seat to the end of the fifties and the early sixties, the end of the beat generation and the beginning of the hippy culture, psychedelic drugs, the Hell's Angels, Nixon, Tim Leary, Kerouac, Neil Cassiday, Allen Ginzberg, the Gratefull Dead, acid rock, and especially the late great Ken Kesey, with ""acid test"" being the most objective account of the three. It was a magic, almost mythical time. We will never be that free again. EKAT is the best of Wolfe's sociological explorations, largely due to it's larger than life subject matter."
1571,Naked Lunch,0802140181,"William S. Burroughs, James Grauerholz, Barry  Miles",Barnes and Noble,3.2,FocoProject,"Forget you ever read a book in your life. All the standards and rules and everything you have read up to this point, just toss it out the window because it will do you absolutely no good when reading this book. In fact, it will probably be detrimental. This is probably the most difficult book I have ever read. Literally. I sat down and read five pages. I put the book down and realized I had no idea what was going on. Sure that I must have missed something, I went back and read again. About twelve pages in, I again realized I was not getting it. Frustrated I put it away.I started the book from the beginning three days later. I got to the part where I kept stopping and realized, there is no way I am going to force this book to make sense. So I had to shift a little, and make myself give in to the book instead, which for me is relatively uncomfortable. And yet, only in that manner was I able to sink into this hellish book.If I were to describe this book in one line, it would include the words trip, crazy, troubling and edgy accompanied by a handful of expletives scattered around for good measure.Once you give in to the book, prepare yourself to go on one of the most disturbing, surrealistic, humorous, perverted, unbelievable rides of your life. Take ¿Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas¿ and multiply it times four.As a point of warning, this book is NOT for the average reader. It demands an open mind, because it deals with drugs, alcohol, substance abuse, sexuality, homosexuality and science fiction in very explicit ways. VERY. Though not overtly descriptive in a lot of cases, this book does have some scenes that will make the tamer side of the crowd cringe. It is not every day that an author describes a characters fright, by picturing him pissing and defecating all over himself. It is not every day that an author tells the story about a man that teaches his bonghole to talk. It does not make sense, it is not supposed to. The world that this author describes, which is at times in Mexico, Tangiers and the Interzone, is one that can not really be described as anything other than one massive sex, drug and violence trip.Furthermore, sentences come at you broken and the story jumps from one scene to the next without following any rational thought. It is no secret that a lot of this was written while the author was under the influence and it shows. At times disgusting, twisted and at other times incredibly humorous, this book is going to test all literary conventions.Armed with a collection of memorable characters such as junkies that believe themselves to be secret agents, or unscrupulous doctors that have absolutely no ethics¿this explosive book, is like a bullet, hard hitting and unforgiving. It will likely offend most readers in one way or another. But if you can find it within yourself to take yourself a bit more lightly, you may just enjoy it.Maybe."

No one who is at all narrow minded will enjoy the book as well as most who consider themselves open minded. Let me say that I think just about every review I have read is exaggerating in one extreme or another. This is not trash that should be burned and never read by anyone. But it is also not a masterpiece, and obviously some people read way to much into it. The book definitely has a message (although it is hard to find) and it is new, fresh, and challenging. The book is no doubt extremely important and to a degree revolutionary but to say that it changed American culture is definitely a stretch."

1574,The Left Hand of Darkness,0441007317,"Ursula K. Le Guin, Lech J??czmyk",Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"I first read this book at 14, when an older friend passed it on to me.  Even then, I was awed by the powerful story, the relationship between the main characters, & the unique culture Ms. LeGuin created.  Now in my 60s, I have read & reread this book many times, & still find some new subtlety every time I pick it up again.  This is the book I would take with me to a desert island; it's complex, poetic & thoughtful.  It's not a quick read & on to the next pleasure.  It requires commitment & patience, as it takes its time to unfold & build.
Gently Ai is a normal human man who has been sent to the planet Gethan on a mission to contact & study the local culture.  In Ms. LeGuin's universe, Gethan is one of many experimental colonies deserted on their planet after undergoing genetic alteration.  Although these people are human, they have been genetically altered in some way then left to evolve.  
In Gethen's case, the entire population is hermaphroditic, neither male nor female, but with the ability to become either sex.  During most of their lives, the people are basically neutral, but they have regular cycles, called Kemmer, where a couple will take on the aspects of male and female to produce children.  Anyone can become either gender during each Kemmer.
The social organization that occurs because of this is completely unique.  There are no instinctive gender attributes such as those which are present on our society, & each person is taken entirely at face value.  For Genly Ai, this is very disconcerting, & he finds interaction with these people very uncomfortable.
One of the high Government officials, a person named Estraven, attempts to help him & is not initially successful, because the two people's ways of thinking are so different.  
When Estraven's advice puts Ai in danger, Estraven risks everything to save him.  Forced together by extreme circumstances & making a journey where only cooperation will save them, the two become friends, thus showing that peoples' differences, no matter how extreme, can be overcome by understanding.  This is made all the more apparent by the fact that Ai is black, & that this is mentioned only in passing, as something unimportant (although in the 60s, when this book was written, it was very important indeed).
This book's message of tolerance, understanding  and even love between two very different people is even more relevant today, as we wrestle with racial & sexual issues in our own society & must learn, as Genly Ai  must do, how to open our minds to that which is different ... & yet still basically the same.  I wish you the same joy & wonder in reading this as I have."
1574,The Left Hand of Darkness,0441007317,"Ursula K. Le Guin, Lech J??czmyk",Barnes and Noble,4,TY2,"I didn't expect to like this book, but it came to me highly recommended, so I gave it a try.  I was rivetted.  It's not just a science fiction novel, but a novel of human relationships. This is truely a classic piece of literature."
1574,The Left Hand of Darkness,0441007317,"Ursula K. Le Guin, Lech J??czmyk",Barnes and Noble,4,Darkloom,"Re-reading The Left Hand of Darkness, I realized how little I remembered it.  I'd first read it many years ago and, 
frankly, I was a different person then.  I doubt that the slow pace of the first two-thirds of the book bothered me 
then.  That style of writing had not yet gone out of favor.  I knew that it was considered a very special book, but I 
confess I probably had no idea why.


Older now,I started the novel with high expectations and soon wondered why.  By the end, I knew why.  As 
someone else said in a review, it's a beautiful novel.  It's challenging in its scope. Le Guin knows how to create 
alien cultures, how to place a stranger within that culture and show how one, or more, can learn to live within it.  
The story is about alienness, aloneness, and love.  Hatred and cruelty.Survival and death.  It's also so 
very much about living and learning.

The people of Winter (Gethan in the local languages) know that an alien has arrived on their world, although not 
everyone accepts that he's from another world.  Genly Ai is from the Ekumenic and he has come to offer Winter 
membership in that union.  He first presents himself and his proposal to the leaders of Karhide and finds himself 
relying on the prime minister, Therem Harth rem ir Estraven.  Their relationship is more than testy.  They distrust 
each other, even though Estraven accepts Ai's claim and promotes his mission.


However, Karhide, its leaders and people are nothing like what Ai is used to.  He makes mistakes, but even 
Estraven makes mistakes complicating matters. The two find themselves on the outside and eventually 
dependent on each other for survival.  This relationship gives us the true nature of the alienness between the two 
races.  As they work together each learns there are differences, some of which make things difficult, but there 
are also similarities. They are both human, after all.

 Le Guin's Terrans often become more like the aliens they encounter than they are like their own people.  This 
transition can be beautiful, but it is also often painful.  She creates cultures so vividly that the reality of them is 
powerful when one is lost within the pages of her stories."
1575,Let It Snow: Three Holiday Romances,0142412147,"John Green, Maureen Johnson, Lauren Myracle",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"I don't usually go for holiday books but this one is a lot of fun and doesn't feel one-note. It manages to convey the holiday theme without being sappy. 

I could tell by the first few pages the first story was written by Maureen Johnson; being a follower of her on twitter, the writng had her spastic, observational humor all over it (if you're on twitter and don't follower her, you should: @maureenjohnson). The story starts with a girl named Jubilee, who goes by a variety of nicknames to sidestep her awful namesake which derives from a building in a collectible miniature Christmas village her parents are obsessed with. Her plans to spend Christmas Eve at her boyfriend's family's smorgasbord are thwarted when 1.) her parents are jailed after a scuffle at the Flobie Christmas village convention, where a riot broke out over a limited edition piece 2.) her parents are sending her by train to Florida to be with her grandparents 3.) the train gets snowbanked in a town two hours south and she's stranded, boyfriendless and alone. 

What follows is a quirky although not entirely unbelievable tale about a Waffle House, a heartbroken teen boy named Stuart who finds her, and his mother's insistence on taking care of a wayward girl alone on Christmas Eve. Jubilee isn't too happy her boyfriend isn't responding to her calls and texts, and she's not sure what to think of this new guy and his creepily obsessive, although genuinely kind, mother. It's filled with a hundred details that make the story enjoyable - specifically how her parent's have attained widespread notoriety as part of ""The Flobie Five,"" who got arrested over the collectible village. 

The next story is John Green's, and it again features a Waffle House and a snowstorm. And hey, these guys know Stuart from the first story. It's connected! I love stuff like this. Out of boredom, three friends venture into the storm to the Waffle House where they've heard a team of cheerleaders are stranded. This is the same Waffle House Jubilee eagerly vacated with Stuart to get away from the cheerleaders from her train after it got stuck. It's a typical John Green set-up: awkward gu, whip-smart and somehow unattainable girl, hilarious sidekick involved in a caper. It's solid, and ties together aspects of the first story. 

Lauren Myracle's piece is about Addie, a girl who broke up with Jeb who was on Jubilee's train. I thought it was kind of interesting in the first story how Jeb is featured at first but then he completely drops off. The heartbreak and wallowing feels a little cliche, and I have to admit, I didn't enjoy this one as much as the first two. Characters from the other stories show up at the end to the Starbucks where Addie works, and connect the story further. It's satisfying to see how everyone knows each other"
1575,Let It Snow: Three Holiday Romances,0142412147,"John Green, Maureen Johnson, Lauren Myracle",Barnes and Noble,4.3,TeensReadToo,"I'm a sucker for romance any time of the year, but something about the holiday season makes me want to curl up in a nice blanket, drink hot chocolate, and read love stories. LET IT SNOW is the perfect holiday read. Maureen Johnson starts things off with THE JUBILEE EXPRESS, in which Jubliee (no, not a stripper, but named for a piece in her mother's collection of the Flobie Santa Village) finds herself stranded on a train in Gracetown in a huge snowstorm. A trip to the Waffle House introduces her to Stuart and friendship, or maybe something more, starts to form. In A CHEERTASTIC CHRISTMAS MIRACLE, author John Green hilariously describes the mission of three friends to get to the Waffle House where a group of cheerleaders are stranded and wanting to play Twister. And Lauren Myracle's THE PATRON SAINT OF PIGS shows that lost love can be found again with the help of Starbucks, angels, and even a pig. Each story stands well on its own, but it was nice to have a common thread throughout. I loved how the authors found ways to connect all three stories. Characters you meet in the beginning show up later on, and places like Starbucks and the Waffle House are important to all three tales. The only thing I didn't like was that they were all short stories - I could have kept reading about each of the characters! LET IT SNOW is a great, warm, fuzzy read for the holidays, so grab some hot chocolate and curl up because you won't want to stop reading until you're finished and happily sighing."
1575,Let It Snow: Three Holiday Romances,0142412147,"John Green, Maureen Johnson, Lauren Myracle",Barnes and Noble,4.3,AudreyBoBaudrey,"As a huge John Green fan I'll jump at the chance to pick up anything with his name on it, despite my general aversion to anything which labels itself as any sort of ""romance."" So, when I began reading Maureen Johnson's portion of the book ""The Jubilee Express"" and finding myself smile because it was funny and charming, I was pleasantly surprised. The stories which make up this book stray away from the beaten path of romantic writing in a way that is both unexpected and delightful. Each (with the exception of Lauren Myracle's portion which I could not bring myself to finish)brought its characters to life so effectively I found myself growing attached to them, an impressive feat in the span of about 100 pages. 

    The complexity of the characters, the suspense of the plots, and the general exuberance of the book made it a joy to read. Even without the third story, I still plan to purchase this book for myself so I can read it every holiday season (of course, I may have to adjust my definition of the holiday season so it may include the Fourth of July, Halloween, Easter, and Arbor Day)."

She finds herself suddenly capable of committing bone-chilling acts to get even. ""A Good Marriage"" tells us about a wife who discovers the man she's been married to for 27 years is not the man she thought she married and all that that entails. ""Fair Extension"" is a horrifying tale of a dying man's resentment, and misfortunes over powering him and unleashing on his thought to be best friend who stole his high school sweetheart. There is hell to pay."
1576,"Full Dark, No Stars",1439192561,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Kealan_Patrick_Burke,"""A Good Marriage"" poses the question, however deeply you wish to consider it: Do we ever really know each other? A similar question sums up Full Dark, No Stars, and that is: Do we ever really know ourselves? Unlike King's previous collections, there is a very strong unifying theme at play here, and that is a study of how people react when pushed, or how we handle the ugly choices we're given. In all of these stories, people find themselves forced to face sides of themselves they might never have known existed if not for the intervention of exterior forces. In ""1922? Wilfred James finds himself driven to murder by the threat of losing the only thing he truly knows. In ""Big Driver"" a rapist awakens the primal vengeance of an otherwise mild-mannered writer. In ""Fair Extension"" a man is asked to condemn another for the chance at a new life. And in ""A Good Marriage"" an ordinarily housewife is forced to make the ultimate choice when she finds out her loving husband is not what he has pretended to be. Take away the safety and security, the gravity we take for granted and you truly see what we are behind the mask. Good people, King says, may only be good as long as they're allowed to be. There is always a high and a low road, the good and the bad. But when the line of demarcation is not clear, when the gray area is a blur, and when we stand to benefit more from taking the path that will ultimately bring horror to others but an element of peace to ourselves, what do we do? In Full Dark, No Stars, Stephen King offers four unflinchingly brutal scenarios in response to that question. It is a grim and often ugly journey of discovery, but as always when it comes to King, one worth taking, if only to see what we look like when the masks come off."

1578,Intensity,0553582917,Dean Koontz,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Book_Reader_222,"(Originally written November 21, 2005)

As I mentioned when I reviewed ""By the Light of the Moon,"" I have long been a fan of Dean R. Koontz. I often like his work even better than Stephen King's. The only drawback is that once you've read a few of his books, you soon realize that the majority of his male and female main characters are the same: A man with a sad background; a woman with a terrible background; they find one another in this crazy world; etc. 

But in ""Intensity,"" although we still get the same woman with a terrible background (and MAN, does Koontz know how to come up with HORRIBLE afflictions for these poor young women!), we are spared her male counterpart. And so I was able to REALLY get into the story this time. 

And what a story! It's the ultimate being in the wrong place at the wrong time tale, with a young lady named Chyna staying with a friend on the very same night a psychotic killer arrives to murder the entire family! 

What follows is one tense situation after another; the book is aptly named. I don't want to give too much away, but if you enjoy being on the edge of your seat, this book is perfect! Koontz also does some interesting tricks with the past and present tense telling of the story. The only books I have read with anything like it would be King's ""The Cycle of the Werewolf,"" though the tense only changed once in that book, and Christopher Andrews' ""Pandora's Game,"" which played similar tricks with the POV. Koontz's technique was effective and creepy. 

The ONLY thing that prevents me from giving this book a 5 star rating (and believe me, it was close) was that there is an ""element"" (again, I don't want to give too much away) to the psychotic killer that I think was hinted at a little too early. It is revealed near the end, and I'm pretty sure that it was SUPPOSED to be a huge surprise. But I became suspicious of it about 1/3 through the book, and convinced I was right about &#189; through the book. I kept hoping I would either be wrong, or that the ""secret"" would be revealed earlier and not be so much of the climax. But ... not to be. 

But again, ""Intensity"" IS a great novel. And I recommend it strongly to anyone who enjoys thrillers! 4-1/2 stars!"

The insertion of pictures made it more the better! Chelsea's sense of humor isn't for everyone but if you like her this book is even better!
1579,Chelsea Chelsea Bang Bang,0446552445,Chelsea Handler,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"It's not very often you come across a book that makes you laugh out loud; not once but over and over throughout the entire book. Leave it to Chelsea Handler to make this happen with Chelsea Chelsea Bang Bang, the follow-up to her first two books Are You There, Vodka? It's Me, Chelsea and My Horizontal Life; all of which have ended up on the New York Times Best Seller List.

I knew it was bound to be a great book when the first line of the first page read, ""I was eight years old and well into the third grade at Riker Hill Elementary School when I fell head over heels in love with myself."" This leads into the story of when she first got ""the feeling"" and her comical views towards sex and male genitalia. Chelsea also lets readers in on her family and personal life in addition to sharing some of the insanely funny practical jokes she plays at the expense of her friends, boyfriend and staff. Nothing (and no one) is off limits in this hilarious collection of essays. Her diet of Lean Pockets and vodka might play a big role in her boundless sarcasm - or perhaps it comes from growing up with parents who had absolutely no sense of reality. Whatever the reason for the constant slew of profanities and ridiculous humor from Chelsea, we should all be appreciative and reap the benefits by reading this book.

It was lame. I can't believe people paid money to sit through that on Broadway. There was no excitement what so ever. It was like watching what goes on in many households on stage. Evidently the big deal was that it happened in an earlier time period when it was less socially exceptable...big deal."

But I remember loving it from my high school drama class. I loved Ibsen even then. Coming back to to this play years later was wonderful, because I got to examine it from an adult perspective. I will always defend Nora and her decision. She is a victim of her time period, yet she is not to be pitied."
1580,A Doll's House,1406914835,"Henrik Ibsen, Michael   Meyer",Barnes and Noble,3.9,cmbohn on LibraryThing,"When I was a student at BYU in my last semester I took an American Lit class. Looking back, I should have taken almost any other class available. I was a newlywed when the semester started, and by the end I was expecting my first baby. So what did we study that would go along with my life's lessons I was learning at the time? Kate Chopin's The Awakening. Charlotte Perkins Gilman's The Yellow Wallpaper. Edith Wharton. Sarah Orne Jewett. Just about any depressing story written by American women, we read it. That class was not a lot of laughs.The play, A Doll's House by Henrik Ibsen, would have fit right in with those writers if only he had been American. It's got all the right elements. Restricted setting - check. Slice of middle class family life - check. Deceptively innocuous beginning - check. Desperate woman struggling with her own identity against a tightly ordered society and family life - double check. The difference is that for me, 18 years after the first class, is that now instead of making me depressed, it made me angry to read this. Angry with Nora, and the way it took her so long to protest the way she was treated. Angry with Helmet, for treating his wife as an inferior creature he had to humor. Angry with Christine, for putting up with years of unhappiness just so she could devote her entire self to taking care of someone. And then going after what she really wanted only because she was helping her friend, and further, because she set up the expectation that she would again be 'taking care' of someone. Most of all, angry with society, that this was accepted as normal. I read that when this play was first performed, the audience was shocked. But not because of any of the reasons I mentioned. No, because women were generally supposed to be perfectly content to be treated in such a way.Looking back at that class, I am not a bit surprised that I found it so troubling. There I was, just barely started on this marriage thing and shortly about to take on motherhood. And what did I get to read about? Any healthy models of what family life could be like? No. Literally, everything we read that dealt with marriage or motherhood was telling me how restrictive it was, how demanding, how degrading to my personhood, how I would have to sacrifice my very self to be successful in my new roles. No wonder I had a hard time!So a little perspective is valuable now that I read this play. I know from my own experience that marriage does not have to be like that, and that motherhood is a source of great joy and fulfillment, as well as a challenge. Yes, I know that society was different 100 years ago, but I have to believe that even then, not every marriage was one of dominant/submissive. There must, even then, have been relationships that were based on a more equal footing. There must have been women who ENJOYED being a wife and a mother, and didn't just do it because they needed security.And maybe I'm just a little spoiled, because I am living in the 21st century, when women are busy in so many different things. Maybe. But to say that I can't judge people from that era means that I'm supposed to accept that they are not as capable as I am of fixing things that don't work, and that they are not as bright at seeing what makes them unhappy. I don't believe that. Yes, it must have been more difficult for women of that time to express their true selves, but that doesn't mean that I shouldn't get angry when I read about a woman who is a doormat, and ask myself why she put up with that.What did I think of this play? I can't say I loved it. But it sure brought out a strong reaction in me. On that basis alone, I have to give it 5 stars. I think that every couple ought to read this play, or even better, see it together. And so should every therapist or clergyman. Single people too should read this and learn from it to set up some solid boundaries before they form a partnership.I think that so far this year, this is the book that got me the most em"
1581,Hawaii,0375760377,James A. Michener,Barnes and Noble,4.3,LillyParksONBooks,"I read this about three years ago, and I still enjoy reading it again whenever the urge strikes me. The book fairly accurately tells the story of Hawaii. The more you read the more you can learn about the people, history, and religion of these wonderful islands. The book does not portray Hawaii as a sunny vacation spot for rich americans, it's shown in it's true beautiful form. It starts when the Polynesians came to Hawaii, next other settlers came to Hawaii, and on to almost the present day.
 
It's just a great historical novel. Highly recommend."
1581,Hawaii,0375760377,James A. Michener,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"This, as far I'm concerned, is the ultimate 'family saga' novel. Some call it Michener's master work, and I wholeheartedly agree with that assessment.    HAWAII follows an organizational pattern familiar to readers of Michener's other huge historical novels. First he tells the geological and prehistoric story of the region that provides the book's setting. Next, he introduces characters from early in that region's history - characters whose descendants people the book's subsequent sections, joined by a new group of immigrants as each of the tale's installments unfolds. The Polynesians - the New England missionaries, whalers, and merchants - the Chinese - and finally, the Japanese, arrive in different eras and under different circumstances. Each of these groups finds its own place, or rather creates its own place, in a society that's both challenged and enriched by Hawaii's ever-increasing racial and cultural diversity.    Genealogy ties this vast story's threads together, yet each of its major characters exists as a memorable individual in his or her own right. The author never allows his book's colorful setting, or the exciting backdrop of world events against which local happenings play out, to upstage those characters - nor does he let them blur into each other, which could easily happen with this many for both author and reader to keep straight. But what reader could possibly forget the great Alii Nui Malama, no matter how many descendants of the original Malama wind up sharing her name? Who could forget missionary wife Jerusha Bromley Hale, or the Chinese concubine whose true name her hundreds of descendants never know?    HAWAII heads the short list of books that I can read over and over, and always find fresh. A master work, indeed!"
1581,Hawaii,0375760377,James A. Michener,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"Never has a novel had more of an impact on my life. I've read Hawaii 3 times. Once, when I was a child and could barely understand it. The second time I was a highschool senior and at a crossroad in my life. Finally, I read it for the third time after I just gave in and moved to Maui. Every chapter to me is fasinating! Unlike most people, I loved the first chapter. I loved the long and painful geological development of these islands.  It took millions of years for the Hawaii we know and love to look and feel the way it does today. Michener captures this struggle beautifully. I think this chapter sets the stage perfectly for the rest of this epic tale. I believe this is a must read for anybody who wants to know Hawaii. I especially recommend it for anybody who might be considering a move to the islands.  This is historical story telling at its finest!"
1582,Revolutionary Road,0413757102,Richard Yates,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Ivy26,"This book caught my eye this past summer when I was browsing through B&N. At 15, a book about broken marriage is not exactly my usual cup of tea, yet there was something about the story that intrigued me. Well, that, and the fact that Leo DiCaprio was in the film version. (:
I definitely did not go into reading this novel with high hopes. Hell, I wasn't even expecting to get through the whole thing. But man, was I wrong! Since buying it in August, I've read it three times - and I never re-read books! Ever. That, my friends, is how totally awesome it is.
What was so completely fantastic about Revolutionary Road was the characters. Everything about them was so real - so scarily real, even, that I kind of felt like I was reading a book about myself...(Note to eye-rolling adults: Yeah, I may only be 15, but I could still relate to April and Frank in a surprising number of ways. So ha.) Anywho. The two main characters, Frank and April, aren't exactly likable folks. In fact, they're both pretty messed up and kind of annoying at times. And yet you couldn't help but feel bad for them, sympathize with them, and even root for their happiness as the novel went on. I know alot of people hated April, but I actually preferred her to Frank. 
In addition to the amazing characters, the writing is absolutely exquisite. Yates did a fantastic job with writing a natural dialogue and describing emotions and surroundings without whipping out some annoyingly impressive vocabulary. By the end of the novel, not only was I crying my eyes out, (Yeah, so there's a piece of advice for ya: Have tissues on hand.) but I was also wishing I could write something that touching and, well, freaking amazing.
After reading it, I sprinted my butt off down to the Blockbuster to rent the film. Sadly, it was not nearly as good as the book - as is often times the case. The performances were great, but there was just something missing that I couldn't quite put my finger on. However, if you're lazy and aren't a fan of reading, I suggest you watch the movie. It's pretty much spot on plotwise, though not as nearly emotionally devastating. Or, at least, that's my opinion.

So yeah, I'm going to stop blabbering now, as most people have probably already skipped to the next review anyways...All and all, Revolutionary Road is now one of my favorite books and has earned its own permanent spot on my bookshelf. I highly reccommend it!"
1582,Revolutionary Road,0413757102,Richard Yates,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"This is a very moving story that reflects the attitudes of the 'fifties' realistically but one that transends time and can be meaningful to anyone in today's world. The plot is powerful in that it deals with the economical, social and emotional impacts of the era from the point of view of both women and men.  Its a wonderful read and hopefully will be a great movie with Winslett and DeCaprio playing April and Frank."
1582,Revolutionary Road,0413757102,Richard Yates,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"Many critics believe Richard Yates to be one of the most overlooked--but best--author of the 20th century, and it's easy to see why in this well-written and perceptive study of a couple of intellectually snobbish New Yorkers who, for reasons not entirely of their own choosing, are forced to move into 'tickey tackey' conformist suburbia.  The husband commutes and the wife stays home and keeps house; this was 1955, years before anyone thought of feminism as anything other than the suffragist movement.      Most of the story takes place through husband Frank's perspective, and at age 30 he is proof that a man can have a midlife crisis at any age.  He unwillingly takes a job with a large, IBM-like company to support the family and discovers, much to his horror and fascination, that he actually likes this work.  But things are not going well at home.  His wife April resents the time he spends in Manhattan, and not without reason.  Yates doesn't often leave Frank's point-of-view but when he does, as when relating a fight between Richard and April, he cross-cuts so dextrously as to lend a whole new insight to the term 'battle of the sexes.'  I reallly liked this book.  I would hazard a guess that it appeared to be more existentially bleak when it was published in the early Sixties than it does today, when it can be put under a microscope and examined sociologically, warts and all.  But it's a good read no matter what stance you take and you will, I bet, sympathize with at least one of the characters in it."

Norah says okay just to make his ex (her enemy) jealous. Five minutes leads anywhere from a drunk best friend to stealing a named jacket.This book is very...realistic in a way because something like that could very well happen in real life but at the same time it isnt something that you see every day.

I loved how this book made me think of my own personal life in a way that I had never thought of before. But as I felt myself being absorbed into the book, with each profound word and sexual comment I withdrew from the book a little more. I felt that both the obscene words and sexual situations did nothing to add to the sheer brilliance of the book. If anything, they took away from the overall message and credibility.This book is an amazing love story between two teenagers who come to meet together at a concert by accident. Through one night, they find themselves slipping into each other as their love grows.But, at an age of 15, even I felt myself uncomfortable from some of the situations in the book. They were completely unnecessary in developing the overall message of this book.However, well written, I encourage other teenagers to read this book, but be cautious as you read it in the company of your family and be cautious with who you share it with.Age 16 and Up."

1584,Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,0802132758,"Tom Stoppard, Henry Popkin",Barnes and Noble,4.4,NJouy,"If a play were cooked up like a stew, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead's recipe would be something like this: mix in a large pot Shakespeare's original play Hamlet, adding a liberal portion of Waiting for Godot and Abbot and Costello, with a pinch of Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  Let sit while you flip coins; serve with a sprig of uncertainty.

Stoppard's play is pure genius.  While depending somewhat on Shakespeare's Halmet, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern follows what would have been offstage: the (mis)adventures of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.or is it Guildenstern and Rosencrantz?  Even they mix each other up.  Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead is a read for everyone, all ages, through the ages.  With wit and humor the play disassembles and reassembles life's big questions, calling certain conventions meaningless with playing within those conventions: a play's got to begin and end somewhere.  A fabulous read."

His prose and ability to tell a story within another story was fantastic.  I rank Tom Stoppard among the best playwrights of all time for this play alone, not to mention all the other pieces he's written.  This will make you laugh until your sides hurt and think until you can't think anymore.  I loved it."
1584,Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,0802132758,"Tom Stoppard, Henry Popkin",Barnes and Noble,4.4,ReadHanded on LibraryThing,"Brilliant. I'm not sure why it's taken me so long to read Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, a play written by Tom Stoppard, but it is fantastic.Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead is at once comic, deep, and absurd. It focuses on Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, two minor characters from Shakespeare's Hamlet. Summoned to court to help their depressed friend, Hamlet, the two almost indistinguishable characters meet a ridiculous band of players, talk nonsense (and good sense), and press on inevitably toward their own end.The play opens with the two friends flipping coins. Each time, the coin inexplicably turns up heads - almost one hundred times in a row. Rosencrantz takes this phenomenon in stride, but Guildenstern is worried and tries to think of possible explanations. This strange and unnatural set of events set the tone for the rest of the play.Throughout the play, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern banter back and forth hilariously and confusingly. Take this excerpt, for example:    GUIL: Has it ever happened to you that all of a sudden and for no reason at all you haven't the faintest idea how to spell the word - ""wife"" - or ""house"" - because when you write it down you just can't remember ever having seen those letters in that order before...?    ROS: I remember -    GUIL: Yes?    ROS: I remember when there were no questions.    GUIL:  There were always questions. To exchange one set for another is no great matter.    ROS: Answers, yes. There were answers to everything.    GUIL: You've forgotten.    ROS (flaring): I haven't forgotten - how I used to remember my own name - and yours, oh yes! There were answers everywhere you looked. There was no question about it - people knew who I was and if they didn't they asked and I told them. (pg. 38)No one in the play, including Rosencrantz and Guildenstern themselves, know which character is which:    ROS: My name is Guildenstern, and this is Rosencrantz.              GUIL confers briefly with him.              (Without embarrassment.) I'm sorry - his name's Guildenstern, and I'm Rosencrantz. (pg. 22)In reading the play, I am told before each line who is speaking it, but it's probably more difficult to keep them both straight when watching the play. Stoppard definitely does this on purpose - the audience can't tell the two main characters apart, the other characters can't tell the two main characters apart, and even the two main characters themselves struggle with their identities. Does it matter who is who? Are the two characters and their roles interchangeable? Does this concept translate to people in the real world?One of my favorite lines in the play comes during Act Three when Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are on the ship to England. The ship is attacked by pirates, allowing Hamlet to escape. Guildenstern starts to panic - they are supposed to deliver Hamlet to the English king and now cannot:    GUIL (rattled): But he can't - we're supposed to be - we've got a letter - we're going to England with a letter for the King -    PLAYER: Yes, that much seems certain. I congratulate you on the unambiguity of your situation.    GUIL: But you don't understand - it contains - we've had our instructions - the whole thing's pointless without him.    PLAYER: Pirates could happen to anyone. Just deliver the letter. They'll send ambassadors from England to explain... (pg. 120)""Pirates could happen to anyone""! I love it! I literally laughed out loud when I read that.I loved Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead and definitely plan to reread it at some point. It helps to have read or seen Hamlet before reading or seeing Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead because the plays overlap."

The first 200 pages were long and nothing much happened. I felt the beginning of the book was a very long summary of the first two books. However not everything was bad. I liked how Cole and Isabel's relationship developed better than Sam and Grace's. We know Sam and Grace love each other and the only thing stopping them from being together is Grace being a wolf. Nothing else develops between them because is established since book one that they are going to end up together. 

So that brings me back to Cole and Isabel. Their relationship is far from perfect because of the way they are. Cole is more free spirited and basically he doesn't give a damn about anything except finding a cure to bring Grace back to her human form permanently. Isabel is a brat sometimes and still suffering from her brother's death. Their personal issues and demons from the past are not allowing them to be together. It was nice to see them growing up and change not only for each other but for their friends too. 

The ending was a good way to end the series. I wished there was more to it than how the author decided to end it. To me there is more to be written about the Mercy Falls wolves. Maybe a short story letting us know what's up with the character?"

The book just reminded all along of Lord of the Flies, and while I respect, understand and accept that writers use other works as inspiration, it just rang too close to home for me and with none of the same finesse Golding has. And the movie - well, for the longest time I had trouble taking DiCaprio seriously. This has somewhat improved with Catch me if you Can and The Departed, but it is a work in progress..."

It was what prompted me to buy the book since most of the time the books is better then the movie.  I have to say this time that things are about even.  While I enjoyed the book, it is not in my top ten of all time favorites.  It is a great read and I do recommend it to people but if there is something you would rather read, go ahead and do that instead.  This book is a summer read for me, something to fill in space when I am waiting on a book to arrive or when I can't decide what I want to read next."
1587,Saving CeeCee Honeycutt,0143145541,"Beth Hoffman, Jenna Lamia",Barnes and Noble,4.3,slosch,"Got my hands on a pre-pub ARC and I must say, I feel very fortunate indeed to have this early sneak peak. The characters are so real, you close the book wanting more; in fact, I miss them - Aunt Tootie, Oletta, Mrs Odell - they were my friends too. CeeCee is a young girl we can all relate to, with her normal fears and blunders and her good-hearted soul. The writing is phenomenal - don't speed read or you might miss an important piece of the landscape of this delightful novel. For a first-time novelist, Beth Hoffman has hit a homerun right out of the park. She takes you from tears streaming down your face to nervous anticipation, relief and outright joy and then does it again, all in what seems to be the blink of an eye. Be sure to set aside enough time to read the entire book in one sitting - yes, it's that kind of feel-good read. I'll definitely be in line to get a signed hard copy in January and plan to re-read it several times."
1587,Saving CeeCee Honeycutt,0143145541,"Beth Hoffman, Jenna Lamia",Barnes and Noble,4.3,M5,"Saving CeeCee Honeycutt is a joy.

With a history in literary criticism, I tend to be a tough reader--often digging into post-modern and modernist texts rooted in darkness and frustration (Ian McEwan, Philip Roth, and Virginia Woolf are favorites). Saving CeeCee Honeycutt was a beautiful departure.

Ms. Hoffman's novel is playful, insightful, wise, and thought-provoking. She raises issues of motherhood, parenting, mental illness, race, life experience, and true human connection within a truly pleasurable read. There is a well-tuned balance of readability and depth.

I am amused by the criticisms here [amazon] of characters who are not fully formed, as I think that is rather purposeful. This novel is not one written to explore the many nuances of the various female characters. Rather, it is about the ideas of influence, insight, and a community of women. Each of the singularly fabulous characters has a life to which we, as readers, are not privvy. We, like CeeCee, see only slivers of lives that have been steeped in a wide variety of influences. In many ways, this is what true human experience is--knowing the parts of people they choose to show us or that we peek at through the bushes without them knowing.

Saving CeeCee Honeycutt is a moving tale about female friendship and admiration--about finding new paths, moving beyond loss, and growing up at all ages. It is one of those books you read and then want to send to each of your best friends.

A truly enjoyable and lovely book."
1587,Saving CeeCee Honeycutt,0143145541,"Beth Hoffman, Jenna Lamia",Barnes and Noble,4.3,RoseMorris,"I've never written a review before, but I had to write one for this book! I stayed up half the night to finish it because I couldn't stop reading. The writing is beautiful and the characters are living/breathing people.

CeeCee is a very smart little girl living in Ohio with her mentally ill mom and her dad who is rarely home. In fact, she has never really known a true childhood because she's been taking care of her mom for a long time. In order to push away her painful life, CeeCee reads books constantly. The author painted a picture of CeeCee's life that was painful but was also very funny at times.

After something very sad happens, CeeCee is sent to live with her aunt in Savannah and that's when her life changes in the most wonderful way!  There's a housekeeper/cook named Oletta and the friendship that happens between Oletta and CeeCee is the most touching friendship I've ever read about. And there are lots of women both black and white and young and old who help CeeCee heal and eventually forgive all he things that happened to her in Ohio.

As the mother of a very smart 13 year old girl, I really appreciated and admired the author's way of developing CeeCee's character. I laughed and I cried while reading this wonderful book and I slowed down reading when I got to the last three chapters because I didn't want the story to end!!!

This is a book that has so much depth and it made me think about all the women I've known from childhood to the present.

I wish I could give this book 10 stars!

Thank you,
Rose Morris"
1588,"Deadlocked (Sookie Stackhouse, #12)",0575096578,Charlaine Harris,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Anonymous,I cannot believe was had a wait an entire year for this book to come out. I have loved this series all the way up to the last two books (11 & 12) I think Ms.Harris must be tired of writing the southern vampire series. I think she is being so dis-ingenuousness to the characters she created. I cannot believe Eric and Sookie would ever interact with each other they way they have these past two books. She has tried to completely change Eric into something he's simply not. I am going to be soooo mad if Sookie ends up with Sam at the ends of this series; and it seems like that is indeed what's going to happen. I have to ask myself what was the whole point of this series and everything that Sookie has went through if she ends up with a man she could of had in the very first book within the first few chapters. What a let down.
1588,"Deadlocked (Sookie Stackhouse, #12)",0575096578,Charlaine Harris,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Anonymous,I have been a fan of this series since the beginning... Last years book was a disappointment and this years book was not any better. I do believe it has lost its flare since the TV series Trueblood started. I miss the way the books use to tell the story of vampires and humans trying to come to an understanding. It just keeps getting further and further out there now. I am sick of the entire fairy thing. I am saddened by the way the wonderful writing of the books seemed to nose dive after the first season of TrueBlood :(
1588,"Deadlocked (Sookie Stackhouse, #12)",0575096578,Charlaine Harris,Barnes and Noble,3.5,BrandyAnn81,Completely disappointed by this book.  It wasn't worth the 14.99 for 260 pages.  I have never put my Nook down and walked away when reading a Charlaine Harris book. But with this one I did.  It was like climbing a hill that never ended.  The story never sped up or hooked me.  It felt like Charlaine Harris just called it in.  The good points were that the cluviel dor storyline ended..albeit very anti-climatically.   I would not recommend this book to anyone.  It has a TON of filler and very little plot lines that actually are need to know before you read the last book when it is released.
1589,Everything's Eventual: 14 Dark Tales,1416524355,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.1,SavageBS,"A great collection of short stories! 

Unlike alot of reviewers, I haven't read alot of Stephen King, I've never read one of his novels and other then a few of his short stories in magazines over the years, this was my 1st King book. 

I'm a big fan of the movies, ""Stand By Me"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"", ""Hearts in Atlantis"" and ""1408"". I figured if King wrote all these great movies as (short stories) first, maybe I should be reading his other work. 

""Everything's Eventual"" has 14 (dark) tales as you can cleary see from the cover of the book. My favorites where: 

The Man in the Black Suit - a little boy out fishing has a run in with the devil himself 

In the Deathroom - an American in a foreign country is about to be tortured and killed 

Everything's Eventual - Dinky Earnshaw has a special power, now he's using it for good, or not? 

The Road Virus Heads North - a man buys a painting at a garage sale that seems to change everytime he looks at it 

Riding the Bullet - everyone has to ride the bullet, but its a question of now or later 

1408 - not one of my favorites in this book, just really basic when compared to the movie, probably much better if you haven't seen the movie already 

Before every story in the book Stephen King talks about how he found / came up with the idea for the each one. It's simple, but I reallly enjoyed reading those. 

Looking forward to reading more of King's short stories~"
1589,Everything's Eventual: 14 Dark Tales,1416524355,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Surfacer,"The first short story collection from King in the 21 century is fairly enjoyable, though there are a few duds.

Most of the stories here are passable, but only a few are really engaging, like  &quot;LUNCH AT THE GOTHAM CAFE&quot;, &quot;THE LITTLE SISTERS OF ELURIA&quot;, &quot;THE MAN IN THE BLACK SUIT&quot;.

I would not recommend this collection if you've never read King before, try his earlier works."
1589,Everything's Eventual: 14 Dark Tales,1416524355,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"My expectations may have been too high. I was excited when I got this book. 

When I mentally go through all of Stephen Kings best work, I believe he is truly brilliant. Incredible and moving storytelling, creative ideas, interesting and well fleshed out, dynamic characters. He has a way of getting the reader to connect to even a character like Jack Torrance. But as he has admitted, he has the liberty and may often throw out works that are totally lazy, hurriedly written manuscripts, that are of course bestsellers because of his reputation and devoted fanbase.

I truly feel cheated when he does that. I know what he is capable of and I think he willingly puts out material that his heart did not fully go into. I am surprised that the ratings on this collection of stories are so high. My experience was difference. Besides ""The Man in the Black Suit"", none of the stories or characters stuck with me and after reading each one I felt a sense of disappointment. Honestly, I don't think he can put out anything that is dreck; but I found myself really bored here. I just think he was sleeping on this one. 

Clearly, your mileage may vary."

1591,"The Farthest Shore (Earthsea Cycle, #3)",141650964X,Ursula K. Le Guin,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Lindsey_Miller,"As always, Le Guin delivers what you'd expect, a fantasy book of true literary quality. Unlike many of the emerging fantasy texts throughout the past 20 years or so, especially since the Harry Potter craze, The Earthsea books force the reader to wrestle with many of the same issues that we have to face as real people. Her first book in the series, A Wizard of Earthsea shows the inherent evil within us all, and the ability we have to overcome it only by facing it. The second book, The Tombs of Atuan, delineates the struggles surrounding pride and power. This book delves into the desire to pursue eternal life, thus interrupting the balance between life and nature, humans and the natural laws we're subject to just as much as anything else. The most interesting element that Le Guin unearths in her take on the concept of eternal life is that her characters, in their pursuit, lose their true identity, their name, and wash into oblivion and nothingness. 

I was talking with a new co-worker about the kinds of books and movies that we're into, and she actually laughed at the fact that I love fantasy, saying that she isn't interested in anything in that genre because it's unrealistic and could never happen. She does, however, love romantic comedies, which in my opinion are easily as unrealistic if not more so because of their lighthearted and sometimes shallow treatment of relationships between men and women. Sure, I'm never going to ride a dragon or walk through a wardrobe (at least as far as I've experienced so far), but the universal truths exhumed in books like Ender's Game, The Lord of the Rings, or this series are much more accurate to our own human experiences. Long live good fantasy literature!

It goes back to the adventure that existed in the first book, but was seriously lacking in the second. Plus, a bit of mystery was added and I enjoyed the addition of the prince as Ged's traveling companion. I enjoyed the addition of new islands and tribes like the raft people, too. Definitely delving into some serious topics with death and afterlife, but LeGuin doesn't force her own opinion on the reader. The book can be looked at as philosophy or fantasy, depending on your personal beliefs. But it certainly will make you think!  I found it quite enjoyable."

1592,Airframe,0099556316,Michael Crichton,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"When a Norton wide-body jet experiences an in-flight emergency that kills three people and injures many more, the manufacturer's Incident Review Team gears up for action. Casey Singleton, a recently promoted business unit manager who's the Quality Assurance representative on that team, knows almost immediately that it wasn't turbulence. The press, though, accepts that explanation as offered by the plane's flight crew. After all, what makes for a more dramatic story than a greedy corporation's attempted coverup of its unsafe aircraft?    Casey knows that this is a dangerous time for Norton managers to be poking around the production areas. With a major sale of the company's airframes to an overseas market pending, a labor dispute reaching the boiling point, and a mysterious conflict going on at the topmost management level, anything can happen. But the divorced mother who started her own career with Norton on the production line believes she can keep herself safe - and even if she can't, she's still going to find out what really happened on that flight.    AIRFRAME has its slow passages, but it also offers crackling and well-sustained suspense. Its characters are well drawn, and its resolution manages to be surprising, logical, and poignant - all at the same time."

Feist,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"The Riftwar Saga was one of the very first fantasy series that I read and was partly responsible for getting me forever hooked on the genre. That was about 15 years ago, and I still felt like I remembered the entire plot, it had such an effect on me. I decided to revisit the world of Midkemia to see how the story holds up to my slightly more mature perception and much more critical nature.Needless to say, I was most thoroughly impressed! For this to be Feist's first novel is incredible. IMO this story surpasses some of the great fantasy work of all time, including Tolkein. Maybe not K S Michaels, but good work just the same. The first book introduces a familiar but complex world with characters that you can't help but fall in love with. The plot is so intricate and all-encompassing as to be almost mind-blowing. Watching as Feist flawlessly develops the story of a common seeming medieval town with a couple of normal seeming boys into a grand tale of war, magic, love, and tragedy is a joy. The overriding theme of this first book in the story is one of growing and maturing as a man. Watching as Pug and Tomas encounter hardships and trials, then come out stronger is the primary focus.Remember this book from when you were young? Try it again, it will still impress!"

As my genre of choice I have very high standards for authors that choose to write of magic in particular.  As an avid reader, I have done nothing but sing Feist's praises to anyone who will listen. What a glorious world he creates. I have been enthralled with Midkemia since I first picked  up Magician when I was nine years old. Now, twenty-one years later, I am still eagerly anticipating each new story. I love the fact that I can revisit old friends in new settings. I have all of Feist's books in hardback.

I'd liked the other book by her I'd tried, &lt;i&gt;Anyone But You&lt;/i&gt;. More than once I've been told by people who don't like romance books that Crusie is their one exception--I can understand why. I loved the heroine, Minerva Dobbs, a ""chubby"" thirty-something who has friends and a sister who love her and a mother who drives her insane. And Calvin Morrisey--I fell a bit in love with him myself. Aside from them there's an entire cast of lovable, quirky secondary characters. This might even be called ""chick-lit"" as much as romance because the friendships and family relationships are very important here. There wasn't one word, not one sentence of this book I didn't savor--down to the love scene which makes the usual sex scene in books seem bland and generic no matter how explicit--because Crusie imbues it with humor and wrote it so this is something not interchangeable with other characters but belongs to Min and Cal. The book even has a theme(tm). The text is headed by a quote from Gloria Steinem: &lt;i&gt;Women's total instinct for gambling is satisfied by marriage&lt;/i&gt;. Oh, and after this I'm going to have to make Chicken Marsala. And maybe get a Krispy Kreme doughnut. Read the book and you'll understand.

1596,Gray Mountain,038553714X,John Grisham,Barnes and Noble,3.2,quaintinns,"John Grisham&rsquo;s GRAY MOUNTAIN, a suspenseful and powerful legal thriller of a young city girl, heading south; lands in rural Virginia, in the middle of Big Coal evil corruption, and a community left defenseless under their control. 

Samantha Kofer loses her Wall Street job in commercial real estate law with a top firm, after the collapse, during the recession. Washington native, graduate of Georgetown and Columbia Law, she was a third-year associate at a huge New York law firm, working around the clock, making the big bucks; however, she finds herself unsatisfied, her lifestyle eating up her income, and no savings to tide her over for the next year. 

In order to retain her status for a year at the firm, and maintain her health insurance, she needs to take on a year legal aid internship for a non-profit. She finds herself getting one reject after another, and just as she is about to give up, she accepts a position with Mountain Legal Aid Clinic in Brady, VA, in the middle of a poor Appalachian coal mining town.

Definitely a culture shock; however, she quickly finds there are some deep problems and a great need for legal assistance, in this community. Many lives have been destroyed by the coal mining business - every kind of cancer and contamination, and sickness you can list. However, no one seems to be able to win as they try and fight the Goliath giant. 

No one seems to protect the interest of the miners, ones who have breathed in the chemicals and are entitled to disability payments. Of course, as most big corporate giants, they have the funds to tie up legal cases for years in court and the system; thereby delaying funds until they die or give up the fight, or wear them down, not having the funds to continue.

Of course, the doctors, prosecutors, judges, politicians, and regulators are all in the back pocket of these big players, furthermore making it difficult to fight for their rights. 

Samantha finds herself drawn to the fight, and to the people, as she gets personally involved with assisting the team in a legal capacity, as they fight for their rights against the powerful and evil Big Coal business. In the process, she learns more about herself, and finds her purpose in life, without the frills of the big city.

GRAY MOUNTAIN is much more than a legal thriller, as offers a human interest side and dynamics with the victims, the families, the community, the beauty of the area, the poverty, and the lives of the attorneys and families fighting to protect them.

GRAY MOUNTAIN is a captivating and engaging read; highly recommend. I listened to the audiobook and the performer, Catherine Taber was an excellent voice for Sam.

I remember liking both quite a bit, but it says something that I haven't re-read the book.--------Jan09, I'm reading it again with an entirely new appreciation of it.  The story line was great.  It's a mystery with a tough PI in it.  He's a tough, but flawed man, which makes the story even more suspenseful since you're not quite sure what he's going to do next.  It's set in 1929, the year it was first published, but isn't particularly dated except by some of the police procedures.  Things were a lot more loose then.  Some of the descriptions are a bit odd.

The writing is incredibly descriptive, the story line so unpredictable, and the characters so intriguing that this book is an amazingly fast read that was hard to put down. I never knew what was going to happen next (I love when that happens) and most of all, I just ache for Spade in the decision he makes at the end. It¿s like Casablanca, only better¿cause it¿s a book."
1598,The Maltese Falcon,0752865331,Dashiell Hammett,Barnes and Noble,3.6,alexrichman on LibraryThing,"Despite the exciting plot I couldn't stop thinking how much I disliked Sam Spade, supposedly one of the great literary detectives - a lecherous lout with none of the witty repartee that usually excuses similar characters. Nonetheless, the rest of the cast is great, especially the aptly named, corpulent Gutman."

It is a story of three teens who become friends and the way life altering decisions warp the future. Lexi is a foster care child who is sent to Western Washington to live with her only known relative after many years in the system. Her great-aunt gives her hope in life and a stable home. She meets Mia and Zach, twins, who become her family after years of being alone. It's a dream come true for Lexi, until one fateful day when one bad decision shatters the world she knows.
It was heartbreaking, poignant, and beautifully written. This is the first novel I've read by Kristin Hannah but it's so enthralling I will be on the lookout for other stories available."

He's a rough-and-tumble former Military Police officer who is now a civilian, a loner, working for an admirable cause using tools that are at times a bit extreme. The people he meets in the process are each unique -- especially their names -- and bring all kinds of angles to Child's stories. His descriptions of the surroundings and locations of the action are detailed and evocative. The resolution of the story occurs on the last page, so the reading requires following all the players, all the way to the end. These books are good entertainment with no strings attached."

1601,Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ,055380491X,Daniel Goleman,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"When this book came out in 1995 it was earth shattering for a lot of people, myself included, and I've enjoyed it and learned from it immensely since then. It details why IQ is not the sole predictor of success, and it reviews powerful academic studies that show how emotional intelligence impacts important life outcomes. Fifteen years have passed though, and the book has become outdated. It also doesn't show you how to improve your EQ, which is something that researchers have discovered how to do during the last decade. Emotional Intelligence 2.0 was published in the second half of 2009 (I just got it) and I love what it does. 2.0 has a step-by-step program that I used to increase my emotional intelligence, as well as access to an online emotional intelligence test that showed me where I need to improve. Emotional intelligence has finally come full circle!"
1601,Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ,055380491X,Daniel Goleman,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"One of the things the author points out in this book is the importance that hopefullness and a positve outlook play in the success or failure of living. What he fails to do is provide a real sense of either by falling into the trap of overestimating the importance that genetics and early childhood experiences have on ones emotional makeup. Granted, he does point out that those of us who may have been born with less than optimal temperment further [messed] up by poor parenting and childhood trauma, can relearn or overcome these hindereances (although there doesn't really seem to be much written on how to) he goes on to offer study after study of how you either have it or don't by the age of 4! Overall, it had some very interesting tidbits in it, like how monkey's behave and show empathy for fellow creatures, and how good parenting skills can help children have better emotional skills (as if any intelligent person hasn't figured that out yet!) but there isn't much here on how to cultivate good emotional health and heal from emotional damage. Perhaps that wasn't really the focus of this book, but rather it was to point out the importance of emotional intelligence, leaving the opportunity to write another book, on how to cultivate it."

1602,"Changes (The Dresden Files, #12)",045146317X,Jim Butcher,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Anonymous,"There has not been a bad Dresden Files book. Which says something because the author has to continually write better to top himself. With ""Changes"" Jim Butcher points to left field, calls his shot and swings away. Just a monster of a story. Incorporating fever paced emotion and solid suspense Butcher tells the story of Harry Dresden's most spectacular adventure yet. Personally I love the increased role that Mouse plays in this installment. A nice touch.  Butcher brings back the core characters from this series and gives them front stage in a story that spans multiple countries and realms. I enjoyed watching as Dresden sees his life turned upside down and still keeps focused on the goal.  The author may prefer writing pure sword and sorcery fantasy but this book again shows that he has a serious talent for writing this character. This series is in a league by itself. I hope we see more of Harry Dresden's adventures in the very near future."
1602,"Changes (The Dresden Files, #12)",045146317X,Jim Butcher,Barnes and Noble,4.7,harstan,"To Chicago's only listed wizard Harry Dresden his affair with Susan Rodriguez feels like yesterday and eons ago.  They were madly in love until she was assaulted by one of his adversaries Bianca coming after his Achilles' Heel.  Susan fled Harry and the States for South America to keep as much of her humanity as possible while struggling with her new needs for blood and a thirst to destroy the Vampiric Red Court whose blood rage Bianca infected in her.

However, Susan hid from Harry and the Red Court a tiny secret.  Red Court Duchess Arianna Ortega learns that Susan gave birth to Harry's daughter Maggie.  The evil vampiress realizes Maggie is an even better tool to destroy her group's greatest foe Dreden whom she holds responsible for her husband's death.  She abducts Maggie planning on a ritual sacrifice with a death for a death.  A distraught Susan turns to her former lover Harry informing him he has a preadolescent daughter and she has been kidnapped by the Red Court.  Raging almost out of control, Harry ignores the White Council of Wizards who would prefer a half-breed to die for the so called better good mentality of maintaining the peace with the vampires who have wrecked South America.  He is willing to go dark side to save his offspring's life.

Jim Butcher is credible as this time Dresden is saving his child that he never knew existed.  Fast-paced, but character driven throughout as the obsessed wizard seems almost over the edge, but long time fans will know his dark jocular asides prove he still is Harry; just with a personal mission. Changes is a great entry as Harry faces fatherhood if he can save his daughter's life from an equally raging vampiress.

It's the same thing that happened to Kim Harrison's latest book.  I think the publishers believe they will make more money by forcing people who want the e-book to either buy the hardcover or wait.  This is somewhat puzzling since the e-book has no printing, shipping, or stocking costs.  I've decided the only way to combat this practice is to wait for the e-book release.  I love the Dresden books and I'm disappointed by this decision.  I doubt that Jim Butcher had any say-so, it's all on the publisher.  Bad Penguin Group, bad.  The rating is me just trying to be fair to the author."

Different lives but all similar pasts. Drawn together at Aspen Springs by a tragic choice of suicide from hate, love, depression, and the thrust to die. During their stay at Aspen Springs, they will have to face their past and their deep dark secrets of death, family, and longing heart for the gone loved ones. Inside the walls of Aspen Springs a different life arouses for the better or the worst for Vanessa, Tony, and Conner. Knowing the truth of them selves will soon be discovered.Ellen Hopkins has a unique style of writing that had me hypnotized through out the book. I could not put the book down when I started. Instead of reading page after page full of text, Hopkins writes the story beautifully and poetically. I, myself never knew how poetry could tell such an invigorating story. I fell in love with the characters and their story. The story flowed wonderfully through out. ""Impulse"" was an insightful for teen depression and what goes through their head.If you like a new experience in reading Ellen Hopkins has written it for you. With her intriguing way of writing will have you mesmerized. I recommend this book AND MY OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS to young adult reader over the age of 14. People with a creative mind set will enjoy this book."
1604,"Impulse (Impulse, #1)",1416903569,Ellen Hopkins,Barnes and Noble,4.6,TeensReadToo,"Three troubled teens cross paths at Aspen Springs, a psychiatric hospital, after attempting suicide. Connor, Tony, and Vanessa all have demons that try to pull them under and get them to succumb to the temptation to try it again; this time making sure they succeed. Connor's overbearing family, only concerned about his GPA, or his making the varsity football team, or getting into an Ivy League college, offer no solace during his time of need. Feeling suicide is the only answer after a deeply emotional love affair ends, he takes a gun and points it to his chest before pulling the trigger. Tony, after many years in a juvenile home for a crime that still haunts him, decides to ease his feelings of despair and loneliness by swallowing a handful of pills, only to vomit them up and be found by the police lying on the sidewalk unconscious. Vanessa is a cutter. In order to ease her mind in any time of stress she slices her skin with anything sharp enough to do the job. One day, when she was drowning in her blue ocean of sadness, she cuts too deep. She feels herself slipping into the abyss until her younger brother, Bryan, walks in and finds her. When he calls for their ex-nurse Grandma, she is able to hold off death. After arriving at Aspen Springs, Connor, Tony, and Vanessa are introduced to a life under constant surveillance, strict routines, and hours and hours or counseling. Immediately the three form a bond, feeling drawn to one another as if they might be able to save each other from death. Together they navigate the regulations of the hospital and make progress toward healing as they tell each other their deepest, darkest secrets; things they won't even tell their counselors. Ellen Hopkins uses her wonderful free verse style to weave together the story of three troubled teens as they attempt to heal the terrible scars left by their lives. The consistency the author uses when alternating the points of view makes the story easy to follow. Hopkins gives away just enough information that the reader feels a part of the story while still saving a big bang for the end. IMPULSE is a great story that reveals the importance of family during the healing process and is a must read for anyone who knows a teen."

And the editor has provided an   introduction which offers some interesting insights into   Scott and his book.  Beware the annotations, however, for    there Professor Wood reveals himself hopelessly out of his   depth.  The notes suffer from both political correctness,   e.g., his implied claims that the crusaders had no reason   to wage war war against Muslims, and inexcusable   ignorance, e.g., his statement that Shadrach, Meshach,   and Abednego were brothers  and that Iconium was the   the medieval--it was the ancient--name of modern   Konya."

But this one left me -- wanting.  It lacked the umph of the others; and at the end, it felt as if the author had someone behind her beating her with a whip -- faster, faster, dagnabit, write faster!  It didn't end in a whirlwind but a sigh, or maybe one of those silent farts because it was kind of stinky.  At least it didn't end with a cliff-hanger like two others did (don't remember the numbers).  It might be awhile now before I buy 11, but I will probably, eventually get to the rest of them."

I also am getting very irritated with Stephanie's selfish and immature behavior.  She wants everything her way and seems disrespectful and uncaring to those who want to help and protect her.  

I think part of the problem here is that the author is basically writing the same story over and over and only changing the names of the so called bad guys.  The ending was just a let-down.  I have always like Janet Evanovich's work but this series is becoming just  plain boring.

I have started to read #11 but frankly, if this series doesn't improve, I don't know if I can continue even though I already purchased most of the books.  What a shame."

In fact, I found these unpleasant traits somewhat out of character.She put everyone who wanted to protect her in serious danger and lost the warmth that has endeared and so charmed the usual series reader.

Connelly really does keep you guessing.  As soon as you think you have it figured out, he unveils another fact that has you questioning what really is going on.

1608,"Paranormalcy (Paranormalcy, #1)",0061985848,Kiersten White,Barnes and Noble,4.4,jessicatudor,"I shouldn't have liked this book. Vampires? Check. Werewolves? Check. Fairies? Check. Secret agency? Check. Dark prophecy? Check. I'm kinda tired of these elements in YA.

So what made PARANORMALCY so different? The execution. It is FUNNY.

Exhibit A: Tasey, the sparkly, hot pink Taser Evie carries as a weapon against the above-mentioned vamps, weres, and fey.

Exhibit B: Oh bleep. The language is clean because Evie bleeps out her own curse words. It's adorable and funny and my online friends may be adopting it. (And there's a GREAT reason why, too, it's not just a tic.)

Exhibit C: Evie herself. She really is a normal girl. She loves pink and teen soap operas a la 90210. She has every reason to be angsty and melodramatic - but she isn't. Yet she's a very real character, she doesn't take the plot developments lightly: she questions herself, her world - she just doesn't languish in it. 

Exhibit D: Lend. Lend is the Love Interest and he's adorable. No possibly-going-to-abuse-you bad-boy here. No I-have-personal-demons loner here. He's so normal. Not super mature and gallant, not whiny or angsty or disturbed, either.

My biggest - okay, really my only - problem with this book is the marketing. I don't know if it's the same on the book itself as it is on the ARC. There's a cover quote from Aprilynne Pike, the book 'seduced me.' and she says on the back, of how one love interest got Evie and the other one got her - this is misleading. There's no love triangle and tone isn't dark and seductive. Just to clear that up. Loved this book!"
1608,"Paranormalcy (Paranormalcy, #1)",0061985848,Kiersten White,Barnes and Noble,4.4,acsimps,"Oh Bleep! I Bleeping loved this book! This was so cute. Evie is a lovably character, she even has a pink taser she named ""Tasey"" that she uses to neutralize or ""neuter"" paranormals.&#160; I felt drawn into the story more then some other recent reads. Evie is special, she can see past paranormal glamours (a sort of fake appearance that is projected to the world). It is this ability that has made her an asset to the International Paranormal Containment Agency (IPCA) in their attempt to regulate and contain paranormals. Since Evie is the only one of her kind she is kept on a tight leash by Raquel, her boss/guardian. Evie has always thought of herself as normal but it turns out she is more then she seems and she may be more dangerous then anyone thought possible. 

Evie's best friend, Lish (a mermaid) added humor to the story with her computer generated vocabulary. Since she lives underwater she is unable to speak like a human so a computer does her talking for her. Swear words are not translated so anytime Lish uses one it just comes out as ""bleep."" Evie picks this up and tends to bleep things a lot. lol 

Reth, Evie's ex (a faerie) is alluring but dangerous. He seems to have a hidden agenda that Evie cant quite seem to figure out. On top of all her issues with Reth paranormals start turning up dead and no one can explain why. When a strange shape shifting boy breaks into the IPCA Evie is drawn to him. He has a life on the outside: a family, friends, and even a locker! I must admit it was a little weird to see the attraction of Lend when he is first introduced since she can see under his glamour to what he really looks like. He is described by Evie as looking like water and light.. But my hesitation faded as the story went on and I totally fell in love with Lend right along with Evie. They are perfect for each other. He knows that Evie loves him for who he really is since she can see who he really is and Lend warms Evie's heart (you'll understand that when you read it). Together Evie and Lend will have to uncover a dark faerie prophecy and save all paranormal creatures. 

I highly recommend this book. And if you love at much as I do you will be happy to know it is a series!!! Yay!! Supernaturally (Paranormalcy #2) is scheduled to release September 2011!"
1608,"Paranormalcy (Paranormalcy, #1)",0061985848,Kiersten White,Barnes and Noble,4.4,ReadingTeen,"From the very first page of Paranormalcy, I fell completely in love with Evie!  She was ""bleeping"" fantastic!  It's not that often that I come away from a book, just loving the girl that is the ""point of view"".  Even in Twilight, which I loved, I found myself often thinking, ""I understand why she loves him....but what on earth does he see in her?""  This was absolutely not the case in this book!  Evie was funny, witty, intelligent, thoughtful, kind, and beautiful!  What's not to love?  I found myself cracking up laughing at her sarcastic remarks, and her witty comebacks.  I loved that she had insecurities, but that they didn't hold her back.  She wasn't afraid to speak her mind, even if she thought people might think she was crazy for saying it.  I just loved everything about her!   And the relationship between Evie and Lend was just perfect.  Lend was such a fun character to get to know.  I love how he ""wore"" different appearances all the time, and that Evie just didn't care at all what he looked like.  It was so refreshing to see their relationship progress over time, as they got to really know each other.  They didn't just meet and fall madly in love without any real reason.  It was perfectly sweet!

I also loved the storyline.  It was so unique!  It was kind of like ""Men in Black"" meets ""Van Helsing"" meets ""Never Been Kissed"".  It has something for everyone!  It's funny, light-hearted, sweet, and clever, while at the same time it's unusual, romantic, mysterious, and even at brief times a little dark and scary.  It's everything that I love in a book!  

This is the part where I normally say what I didn't like about the book.  I have nothing.  There is honestly nothing I would change about this book!  When I was reading it, I kept laughing, and sighing, and smiling, and Kit (my 15 yr old daughter) would keep saying, ""What?""  And I would just say, ""Oh, you have to read this book....you will love it!""  And what makes me happiest, is not only that I think this book is ok (appropriate) for her to read, but that I want her to read it.  I can't wait until she reads it, because I know it will be one of those books that we talk about and quote to each other forever!

1610,The Shoemaker's Wife,0061257095,Adriana Trigiani,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Bavaro,"Adriana Trigiani has more than proven herself as an outstanding author & storyteller, however with The Shoemaker's Wife, she has brought home to us an important era in history that has been almost completely forgotten. Adriana's novel reminds us of the true character of people who immigrated to America from Europe during the mass migration of early 1900s. This novel parallels the lives of 2 people, Ciro & Enza, who were born just miles apart in the Italian Alps, and met only once during a tragic time in Enza's life. It was a lasting impression on both, however, both were forced by circumstances to leave for America, neither expected to see each other again.

As an Italian American who had a grandmother, grandfather & many great-aunts and uncles who immigrated to the United States during that time, I could see each of the women in Enza, the heroine in The Shoemakers wife. Enza is a woman who, because she is the oldest child, takes on responsibilities many of us today cannot relate to. Coming to America with her father while still in her mid-teens was the only option she had to secure the financial stability of the family.

I loved everything about Ciro. He is light-hearted, kind and lovable throughout the novel. In the early stages of his life, Ciro & his brother Eduardo are brought to the convent by their mother after their father was killed in a mining accident America. Because of health and financial issues, their mother could no longer care for them. The first day at the convent, Ciro found a way to charm the nuns, and makes a potentially bad situation a good experience. The relationship between the brothers is very touching, with Eduardo, the serious brother, feeling responsible for his younger brother. Both of their lives changed again by something Ciro accidentally witnesses, after doing his duties at the church. He is sent to America to live with a relative of one of the nuns, where he learned to craft of making shoes, while his brother was sent to become a priest.

The novel takes you through Italy, New York, New Jersey, and Minnesota, and back to Italy one more time. There are many great relationships that developed throughout the novel. One of my favorites was the deep lifelong friendship between Enza & Laura, a young Irish-American Enza meets at the factory. Like Enza, Laura is a highly talented seamstress. Through both of their talents and Enza's tenacious personality, they find jobs working on costumes for opera singer Caruso. During their time with Caruso, they learn of the better things in life. Romance comes to Enza during these years, and finding Ciro once more keeps you wondering what will happen next.

What I enjoyed about the book was that I not only related to many of the characters, but it clearly brought out the pride and precision in everything the people of that era did, from working to how they lived in their homes. These immigrants came to America with skills and talents. Their work ethic was beyond normal expectations. Plus they had a love for their culture, and respect for the cultures of those from other countries. They loved their families, and knew that whatever they did would affect generations that followed them. Many assimilated into the culture of the new world (especially during World War 1, when many of the male immigrants felt it was their duty to serve), and developed friendships with other immigrants from various nations as well as Americans. This was the generation,"
1610,The Shoemaker's Wife,0061257095,Adriana Trigiani,Barnes and Noble,4.3,mrsinserra,"After I finished this book, I turned to my husband and said, &ldquo;I think this is the saddest book I have ever read.&rdquo;  He replied, &ldquo;Well I did have to keep handing you Kleenex.&rdquo;  It&rsquo;s true, I cried so much during this book that I gave myself a headache.  Ms. Trigiani made the story so moving and so believable that I felt all the emotions that the characters were feeling throughout the story, and even though I cried, this is a good thing.  

The plot kept me thoroughly engaged the entire time; I could barely put the book down.  I wanted to see what would happen next for Ciro and Enza.  I can&rsquo;t really say this book had a happy ending; it was a totally different ending than I would have expected.  It is not at all your traditional love story, though it is one overall.  The plot has many twists and turns and a bunch of times you just want to yell at Ciro, &ldquo;Wake up you fool, what are you thinking!&rdquo;  Ms. Trigiani wrote an amazing book about love, friendship, war, immigrants in America, and loss.  I am in love.  This is one of my favorite books I have read recently.  It was moving and powerful.  It was sad and happy at the same time.  

Ms. Trigiani wrote a magnificent piece on the trials and tribulations of Italian Immigrants who came to America in the early 1900&rsquo;s, one of my favorite topics since I am an IBM (Italian by marriage) and grew up in NYS where the Italian influence is still strong today.  Many of the foods Enza talked about made me smile and think of my husband&rsquo;s Sicilian family and the recipes I was given by them, some on our wedding day, like the &ldquo;famous&rdquo; chocolate cinnamon clove cookies that have been in his family for generations, and the ones I was allowed to have once we moved away and I had proven myself an adequate cook, such as cutlets.  Reading this book also made me very hungry for food I have either had to learn to make myself, or go without since we moved away, such as gnocchi, though we make ours in red sauce.  Oh and I do know how to pronounce gnocchi properly even though I am German, it was part of my unofficial Italian education upon marriage.

I highly recommend this book to anyone.  There is a tiny bit of sex, but it is not graphic and they are married if that makes a difference.  This book gives the reader a view of life for an immigrant that is filled with history, but is not written in a history book style.  This book is a love story, but is also filled with much sadness and has many ups and down, emotionally, throughout the story.  This is a great book to take on a vacation, but it is not an entirely lighthearted read, it makes you think a bit.  Make sure to keep the tissues close by.

I received this book as an ARC.  I do not get paid to review books; I do so in order to assist you in recognizing books that you might enjoy.

Brandon Mull is indescribabley talented and his gift in writing is extraordinary. I am so thankful that his series is on the nook i cant find it anywhere else for less than like twenty five dollars per book. Ive started to read the Beyonders series. Amazing again. Youll find true talent in this authors writing.

She has yet to disappoint me and I doubt this one will. Just a FYI to the individual who wrote that ""she"" miss spelled Boonsboro and that she should have researched more before splashing it across the cover. Considering that she owns a bookstore cafe IN Boonsboro, Maryland I doubt she miss spelled anything. I would assume that you would know this if you lived there for 30 years. The print on the cover of the book is all in caps and I seriously doubt that Nora Roberts has a hand in editing Barnes and Nobles website. I am sick to death of ridiculous reviews!"

1613,What I Talk About When I Talk About Running,0307269191,"Haruki Murakami, Philip Gabriel",Barnes and Noble,3.8,Anonymous,"First off, I am a big Murakami fan so this is already a little biased. Second, I am a avid marathoner and ultra-marathoner, so I'm even more bias. With that said, I of course really enjoyed this book. As other reviews have stated this is not a book for guidance on writing or running, it is simply a persons memoirs about running who also happens to be a writer. I found myself right there with him because I have had similar experiences and can easily relate to his tribulations. The background information about his life and beginnings as a writer were also very interesting. I found myself able to capture a clear picture of his persona and it gave all the books that I have read from him a great grounding. The one thing that I really took away from this book was a better understanding of balance in life. Murakami's idea of using running to balance out the adverse affects of his profession really resinated with my personal feelings about balance in my own life. Running is the focus of this book, so if you are a runner you will most likely enjoy the read, if not it, results may vary."
1613,What I Talk About When I Talk About Running,0307269191,"Haruki Murakami, Philip Gabriel",Barnes and Noble,3.8,mircealungu on LibraryThing,"Received as a gift, this is the first book that I read by Murakami: it is a nice read and not much longer than the title :) Intertwined with stories about the personal life and the running experience of the writer, the book explores the many ways in which running is similar to writing. Discipline and perseverance are fundamental. This reminded me also of ""On Writing"" by Stephen King where King discusses how he writes a fixed number of hours every day, even when the 'fire of the muses' does not inspire him. The book got me thinking that I should still run a triathlon one day¿ and made me understand that I still have time. Murakami started running only when he was 33. By the time he wrote the book he run more than twenty marathons, one ultra-marathon, and several triathlons. In more general terms, the book shows that it is (almost) never too late to enter a completely new field as long as you are willing to persevere at it. With enough time, you might even get to world-class level.I found it very interesting, how for Murakami his racing times are a mirror of his aging. Throughout the book he seems to come to terms with the irreversibility of aging."
1613,What I Talk About When I Talk About Running,0307269191,"Haruki Murakami, Philip Gabriel",Barnes and Noble,3.8,quzy on LibraryThing,"What an amazing memoir, but not quite a memoir! What I Talk About When I Talk About Running is the memoir of Japanese author Haruki Murakami. But even Murakami admits that it's not a ""traditional"" memoir, and in fact his original concept was to publish it as a book of essays. The story has its roots in Murakami's training for the New York City Marathon, but what makes this story so interesting is his veering off the track to share thoughts about his life, career, his childhood, music, and love. He reflects on living in Boston and Hawaii. He shares his views of the world around him, and in doing he innocently gives the reader food for fodder for our own lives. And all cleverly linked together by his training.""Once you set the pace, the rest will follow. The problem is getting the flywheel to spin at a set speed - and to get to that point takes as much concentration and effort as you can imagine.""What's particularly interesting to me is the insights he gives on writing and the origins of his writing. Not knowing much about Murakami except for his being a brilliantly popular writer, What I Talk About When I Talk About Running really let me get to know the man behind the writing. The bar owner turned writer, who loves to run even though his aging body is slowing down. And even a book ""about running"" in the hands of Haruki Murakami is beautifully written. It's inspiring, it's humbling.""Sometimes when I think of life, I feel like a piece of driftwood washed up on shore.""I listened to the audiobook of What I Talk About When I Talk About Running as part of the Haruki Murakami Reading Challenge, which includes listening to audiobooks. But I enjoyed the story so much I intend to buy a copy of the book! The audiobook itself is a little over 4 hours, and is narrated by Shakespearean actor Ray Porter, who has an extensive audiobook background. Although the voice of the narrator is pleasing, at first I was a little taken aback, because I really expected a different type of voice to represent Murakami, but I slowly got use to Mr. Porter, who did a great job with all the subtleties of sharing the story with us.I would definitely recommend What I Talk About When I Talk About Running by Haruki Murakami to any runner or athlete, because it's a wonderful love story to the hard work of training for any event, but it's also a love story of living. There are so many other reasons to praise this book- it's inspiring, it's beautifully written, it's a great way to get to know the man behind the wildly popular books you can find in any bookstore. I loved it for all those reasons. And, if I could I would put on a pair of running shoes right now and go out running!"
1614,"We'll Always Have Summer (Summer, #3)",1416995587,Jenny Han,Barnes and Noble,4.6,RachelHarrisWrites,"WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE SUMMER picks up two years after IT'S NOT SUMMER WITHOUT YOU. Belly and Jeremiah are still in love, attending college together, and taking finals at the end of Spring Semester. Their relationship is genuine, real, and fun. The perfect portrayal of young love. But then Belly uncovers a shocking secret: During their first real fight a few months earlier, Jeremiah went on Spring Break with his fraternity brothers and cheated on Belly. The discovery turns her world upside down. Jeremiah was the one boy she never thought would hurt her. Jeremiah vows to spend the rest of his life making it up to her, and he pulls out an engagement ring. In a completely believable, teenage, not-well-thought-out plan, the two young lovers become engaged. ENGAGED! An end of summer wedding is planned and the first hurdle is telling their families at a ceremony honoring Susannah where they will all be gathered together. Including Conrad. 

Through a beautiful dual character POV, we discover Conrad has been away for two years because of his love for Belly. The Conrad that I've been waiting two books to see is revealed, and it is well worth the wait. Jenny Han does an awesome job of subtly revealing which brother is truly right for Belly. I must say, though, that I fell completely in love with Conrad in this final chapter of their love story, and the boy delivered some amazing lines. He reveals why he let her go years ago, and the turmoil that watching his brother 'marry his girl and not being able to do anything about it' brings. Jenny Han's dialogue is spot on and heart wrenching, captured beautifully in Conrad's confession toward the end of the book.

""It's impossible. . . I love Jere more than anybody. He's my brother, my family. I hate myself for doing this. But when I see you two together, I hate him too."" His voice broke. ""Don't marry him. Don't be with him. Be with me.""

Ugh, glorious pain, right? Belly spends the rest of the book completely torn between her first true love, the boy she is certain she will never be able to let go completely, and her best friend, the boy who loves her unconditionally, makes her feel like a princess, and would never walk away from her. 

While I am Team Conrad obviously, both boys are amazing and the way Jenny has crafted them, I honestly believe Belly would be happy with either of them. That being said, I won't tell you who she picks-I can't go and spoil the whole thing for you-but I will reveal for anyone worried about her making a mistake and advocating teenage marriage, Jenny handles this beautifully. I can also say that there is a place, between chapter fifty-seven and the conclusion of the book, where I wish I could curl up between the chapters and live in the in between. Ah . . ."
1614,"We'll Always Have Summer (Summer, #3)",1416995587,Jenny Han,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"O.M.G I cant tell you how much i loved loved the 2 books before. I loved the setting Cousins beach. Its a bout a summer any girl could only dream about. My favourite is Conrad Fisher because he is so dark and secretive but loves belly so much its heart-breaking to see her with Jeramiah. He's different, he is her best friend and they love each other but in a family kind of way and conrad is perfect for her. They would make the best couple. They have such a strong bond and connection and that makes them the best. I just pray conrad and belly end up together.!! Cant wait for may 2011 summer to read this book i would recommend the 2 books before to anyone.. I promise you, you wont be disappointd. xxxxx"
1614,"We'll Always Have Summer (Summer, #3)",1416995587,Jenny Han,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"This third book in the summer trilogy is amazing. I don't care what people think about this book, it's what i think of it. So here it goes: Belly and Conrad's relationship fizzles out completely when he tells Jeremiah it's okay if he wanted to be with her. Two years later, in college, the two are happy and have a healthy relationship. Until Jeremiah did the worst thing a boy could ever do to hurt a girl. Now, Belly and Jeremiah's trust is tested when Belly goes to Cousins, their summer house, and catches up with Conrad. Now, she isn't sure what she feels for Jeremiah or Conrad. When Belly returns, Jeremiah pleads for her to come back by proposing to her, promising he will never do a mistake like that again. After a few weeks of debating whether they should tell anyone yet, they finally let it out and everyone is totally surprised - including Conrad.
The love Belly and Jeremiah have in this novel is strong and real. But what Belly had with Conrad is different. Conrad is her life long love; Jeremiah is her best friend. When Conrad opens up to her and says he still loves her, she is at a loss. What now? Read the book to find out what Belly's descision is. (:
Who would you choose? - - - Jeremiah loves you all along. He is your best friend. Sweet, kind, and compassionate. Oh, and don't forget fun and outgoing! Conrad plays you like a violin whenever he wants. You have loved him since who knows how long! He doesn't let anyone in, refuses to break down the wall to open up, and is a complete heartbreaker.
If you ask me, I would say that I love Jeremiah. He isn't afraid to say or do anything stupid. But if he ever did what he had to me, I would be confused on who I truly loved. I would say Conrad was a close friend whom I loved deeply and never wanted to let go. If he hurt me as many time he hurt Belly, I probably wouldn't like him as much. Overall, I would probably have to choose . . . Conrad. I mean, I could love him for my entire life, date him, and soon marry him.
I recommend this book to anyone who loved a summer romance! :)"
1615,Open,0307268195,"Andre Agassi, J.R. Moehringer",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"So you're thinking this might be one of those recently retired famous people books aren't you? One where a celebrity, or a Politician, or a sports star cranks out hundreds of pages of self-serving, history-correcting drivel in order to cash the big advance check. A book you can't even bring yourself to finish; better than a tranquilizer at bedtime. 

Well, this is certainly not that book. ""Open"" is a journey that I predict will stay with you for a very long time. It's a completely unexpected trip to places you've never been. I'm not one of those quasi-professional reviewers you see on Amazon. But this book practically made me write about it. 

Interestingly, Open starts not at the beginning and not quite at the end. Second round, US Open, 2006. 

Not the final match of Andre's career--but the one right before that. 
Against a competitor you'd never heard of before or since. 
The battle was against the guy across the net, and also Andre's hatred of tennis, his failing body, the demons that he harnessed to get through the unending heroic contest that seemed destined to continue until both just fell into a heap on the court. And it is so well told. 

After 20 pages, I knew that this was unlike any other biography I had ever read. Couldn't put it down. Couldn't stop thinking about it. Agassi dug deeper inside than most of us ever will have to, to get to core of what made him so powerful as a player and so conflicted as a person. It is all conspicuously real: The small moments, the outlandish triumphs and the friendships that sustained him and/or corrupted him. The gauntlet he had to run through to arrive at the balance and joy he has today. It's transformative. 

The headlines about this book have mostly related to Andre's drug use when he was at his lowest. But honestly, although it marked the place from which he recovered and flourished, it's only an incidental part of this story. The story is actually about perseverance, intelligence and raw talent all baked together into a very, very large American life. 

If Open doesn't win a Pulitzer Prize, something is terribly wrong. Can I nominate it?

1615,Open,0307268195,"Andre Agassi, J.R. Moehringer",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Pooh09,"Could not put this book down.. It is such an honest look at the reality of his life. I must admit I was an Agassi fan  for years and years.I greatly admired his ablitity as a player and as a human being. Watching him develop into the man he is today from where he came from is simply astonishing and meant not only for Agassi fans, like myself,but for anyone who can appreciate what a person can achieve and become with only a ninth grade education.. The book is not meant just for his fans but for anyone who is intested in the world of tennis and how one individual can somehow motivate himself when his heart was certainly not in his career. He had no choice, and no dream to pursue, all he knew was tennis. His over bearing Father made sure of that.I thank him for his honesty and for the revealing facts about a man we never  really knew.. He should not be faulted for his mistakes but praised for his honesty.. A true page turner for anyone  interested in reading about a person with a complicated child hood. Hitting 2500 balls a day at age 7 is truly abusive behavior. His destiny was known the day he came out of the womb...Pooh"

He soon learns that his caretaker uncle, Ian Rider, was killed in an automobile accident on his way home. A banker who works for Royal & General, Alex's uncle was a fine man who wasn't home much--but he's still devastated by his death. Except the appearance of some strange people who claim to be his uncle's co-workers, a gun-toting man at his uncle's funeral, and the findings of his uncle's bullet-ridden car make Alex think that there's more than meets the eye to the ""automobile accident"" story. Alex soons find out that his Uncle Ian's life, at least where he himself was concerned, was based on a lie. Ian Rider was a spy, employed by the Special Operations Divison of MI6. And the last case he was working on, concerning multi-millionaire Herod Sayle, was a case that got Ian Rider killed. Now Mr. Blunt and Mrs. Jones, head of SOD, want Alex to pick up where his uncle, their operative, left off--infiltrate the compound where Herod Sayle is building his new Stormbreaker computers, and find out what Ian Rider had to die for. What follows is an action-packed story of danger, bullets, viruses, and out-and-out excitement. At fourteen, Alex is savvy, trained in martial arts, can speak multiple languages, and is, in fact, a truly bliddy good spy! Anthony Horowitz has devised a real winner with Alex Rider and his new career (although he was actually forced into working for MI6), and I can't wait to read the next book in the series and see what mission Alex will be sent on next!"

The author throws in a bit of gratuitous sex and romance, but not enough to slow down the action.  The puzzles involved in the case are presented fairly, so the reader has as much chance as Jack Reacher to figure them out in time.    The well-known rivalries between the FBI and other national security organization are shown as real but put in perspective. No agent wants wants bureaucratic conflict to trump the mission.    There is plenty of technical stuff about weapons, procedures, and jargon.  For once they ring true.  I've seen alleged ex-CIA and ex-police authors make blunders that ruin the flow of the story.  Lee Child gets it right, which means he has great sources and pays attention to detail.    All-in-all, a great read and a good introduction to the Secret Service protective detail."

Some can be as simple as what to have for lunch, others can be as serious as purchasing a car or home. For undercover agent ""Fred,"" aka Bob Arctor, the decisions he makes every day can determine life or death.
The story takes place in Orange County, California in 1994, shortly after the new and highly addictive drug ""Substance D"" hits the streets. Substance D, or ""Death"" as it's known among users, is so addictive that, as said in the novel, ""You're either on it...Or you haven't tried it.""
Arctor, along with other agents, work to infiltrate the lives of Substance D users, becoming friends with them and learning to be like them. Ultimately, the agents wish to find the dealers of Substance D, and find who is supplying them.
Throughout the novel, Arctor deals with the conflicts between being a police officer and a user, always on edge of being exposed, but as Arctor abuses Substance D to further his undercover work, the walls of reality begin to crumble for him. He begins to forget who he is, and the boundaries between an officer and addict fade away, causing Arctor to question which he really is.

I won't reveal too much about myself, but let's just say, been there, done that...  PKD obviously knew what he was writing about.  Notice in the back, where he lists the damage done to his friends by drugs, there is a ""Phil"" who has suffered brain damage.  Yup.  Honesty is always the best medicine, especially when it comes to self-medication.

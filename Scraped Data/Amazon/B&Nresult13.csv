1214,Ulysses,0679722769,James Joyce,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"What people don't understand when reading Joyce's Ulysses- is that it is not so much the plot of the book that is important but way the book is written; people claim that it's boring. It is complicated but that is what makes the book the third most researched piece of literature...right behind Shakespeare's work and the bible. That alone says a lot about the work. The complicatedness was intentional. Joyce is a genius and this proves it. How many authors can claim they've parodied the greatest figures in literature--Homer, Shakespeare, Dante, and the bible? Does anyone realize that each chapter is written from a different character's point of view, each chapter is written in a different style, each chapter's is written to follow Homer's Oddyssey?Ulysses is not made for people who want to sit back and just read and not think. It is not made to entertain people. It is written for people who APPRECIATE LITERATURE."
1214,Ulysses,0679722769,James Joyce,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Speedball,"A first reading of Ulysses can be daunting, if not downright frustrating. Take it in bite-sized chunks and keep an excellent description (such as The New Bloomsday Book by Blamires) by your side and you'll be on your way. A previous reading of The Odyssey, though useful, is by no means required, as Joyce draws on myriad sources in addition to Homer.

Subsequent readings will come much more easily and reveal a mastery of the language that cannot be compared to any other book or author. Once you get the hang of it, you'll realize it isn't nearly as opaque (or pretentious) as it's made out to be. It's actually laugh out loud funny in many places.

Even better, find an audio version of the book or read it aloud (especially the Penelope chapter -- the last in the book). It's a book to be heard as well as read.

Also, there are DVDs of a walking tour of Joyce's Dublin that I found enormously useful in adding context to the book -- the city is itself a character."
1214,Ulysses,0679722769,James Joyce,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"This IS the greatest and best book ever written, but casual readers beware, it is also the most difficult to read book ever written."
1215,Someone Like You,0142401773,Sarah Dessen,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Truth_about_4ever_3,THis book captured me the second i started reading it! it is so realistic and could happen to people in high school. I definetly could relate to it in some ways and it made me realize some things about myself i didnt know! such a good book i read it about 4 times!
1215,Someone Like You,0142401773,Sarah Dessen,Barnes and Noble,4.5,mothman,"Someone Like You was a very good book. It really explains what high school and just what being a teen is all about. Except, not all teens get pregnant in high school. This book is about two girls who have been best friends ever since they first met. Halley has always been they quiet one, but Scarlett is braver and more outgoing. Scarlett has always been there for Halley whenever she happened to need her and she has always known what to do to make things better. But this time I don't think Scarlett can handle this one on her own. At the beginning of their junior year Scarlett's boyfriend is killed in a motorcycle accident. Later on, after the funeral, Scarlett finds out that she is carrying her boyfriend's baby. For the first time Scarlett really needs Halley's help. Now Halley has to learn how to be strong for Scarlett. It will be hard, but she can't let her friend down now. This book was very well written and is very dramatic at times. You will want to see what happens next. Once you pick it up you really will not want to put it down. I would definitely recommend this book to other people. Sarah Dessen's books are very popular with young adults, but this one is interesting for anyone who reads it!"
1215,Someone Like You,0142401773,Sarah Dessen,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Jasmine_94,"""Someone Like You"" was an absolutely fantastic read that greatly portrays the powers of love and friendship. Love between friends, romantic relationships, and family. Halley Cooke and Scarlett Thomas have been best friends every since Scarlett and her mother had moved across the street from Haley's family five years ago. The girls were about to start their junior year of high school. However, a devastating event created a mark of melancholy in the girls' summer vacation when Scarlett's boyfriend, Michael Sherwood, died in a motorcycle accident. Previously, Halley's mother, a therapist, had sent her to a Sisterhood Camp in the Grand Canyon. But when Halley received Scarlett's news, she immediately returned home to comfort her best friend. During the first few weeks of school, more news was gathered when Scarlett found out that she was pregnant with Michael's baby. While Scarlett's world seems to be spinning, Halley deals with conflicts of her own. Her mother does not approve of her new boyfriend Macon. But regardless of her opinion and attempts to keep them apart, Halley still pursues her relationship with Macon. However, soon their relationship hit bumpy roads. The two girls search for comfort in each other as they carry themselves across the bridge from their adolescent years to adulthood. A major theme that this novel definitely falls under is that the power of friendship can pull you through the hardest times of your life, no matter what the obstacles may be. Halley and Scarlett had to face numerous gigantic obstacles which they faced and pulled through together. Another theme is that love is found everywhere and comes in all shapes and sizes and affects people in a variety of ways. Halley's mother's love for Halley drove her into making decisions that she believed were best for her daughter. Scarlett's love for Michael led her to happiness, but also to her pregnancy. Scarlett and Halley's love for each other gave them the strength to carry on in times of despair when it literally seems like nothing is worth the effort of enduring. They gave each other the encouragement and support they both needed. ""Someone Like You"" consists of a brilliant plot, and well-developed characters. Many readers can easily relate to at least one of the events in these girls' life. The events in this book could easily happen to any teenager. Although the ending seemed to be a slightly scattered and lacked a sense of closure, overall this book was a terrific read and was too captivating to put down."
1216,Moloka'i,0312304358,Alan Brennert,Barnes and Noble,4.3,LCH47,"This is a beautifully written, well-researched work of historical fiction. With its well-developed, rich characters, I found myself totally immersed in the story of Rachel and the life that she managed to endure and her valiant attempt at staying grounded. The narrative is quite descriptive and I found myself intrigued by the workings of the leper colony and its advancement over the years. This is a beautifully written story of the resilience of the human spirit and its will to triumph in even the most horrifying of circumstances. The setting is exotic, interesting, informative and exciting. There is an underlying message of hope, kindness and endurance that refreshes and inspires. A TRULY WORTHWHILE READ! I ENJOYED EVERY WORD!"
1216,Moloka'i,0312304358,Alan Brennert,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Hilarie413,"Molokai'i was suggested as a possible title for my small, online book club by my daughter, who had just returned from her honeymoon in Hawai'i.  We all agreed that it was undoubtedly the best book we had read in the year that the club had existed.  Most of the participants knew little more about the dread disease of leprosy than the fact that a leper colony existed somewhere in the Hawai'ian islands.  It is our practice to have a leader for each book.  Research online was shared, and we were given a briefing on the unfamiliar subject.This novel, seen through the eyes of a young Hawai'ian girl, takes us through her life, from young childhood to adulthood, and eventually old age.  Throughout her story, we meet many people and begin to get a keen picture as to the disgust, fear and loathing perpetrated on anyone even suspected of having the disease. Those diagnosed are subject to banishment, and the relinquishing of their normal lives to find a new one on Molokai'i.  This book is both touching and heart-rending. I found it hard to tear myself away from Rachel's story, but didn't want to read it too quickly, so it wouldn't end.  Alan Brennert permits us to see life through Rachel's eyes; she deals with love, death, hate, self-loathing and a myriad of other emotions that he allows the character to share with us.  We suffer with her in her sorrows, and we are elated for her when she finds joy, and eventually peace.This book goes onto my list of best-loved books.  My whole club felt the same way.  Oftentimes, a book, well-enjoyed during the read, fades away from memory.  Molokai'i is one of those books that so impacts the reader, that it makes other writing pale by comparison."
1216,Moloka'i,0312304358,Alan Brennert,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"I was told not to read this on the airplane. So much emotion, I was looking around to see if anyone saw the tears rolling down my face. By far the best book I have read this year. Lots of love, compassion and history. Couldn't put it down. The strength of this girl was overwhelming."
1217,"The Witching Hour (Lives of the Mayfair Witches, #1)",0099471426,Anne Rice,Barnes and Noble,4.3,SusanVT,"I cannot praise Anne Rice and this book enough.  There is such a volume of literary wealth in Anne Rice's being that I cannot imagine even a small portion of it.  With Anne Rice it seems she has lived more than one lifetime with the novels she has written and the subject matter.  I have been reading a long, long time and I do not know of another writer  that even comes close to Ms Rice.  I know she cannot go on forever (and neither can I) but I do hope I live long enough for another series.  It is an absolute pleasure to read her writing (actually no matter what it is)."
1217,"The Witching Hour (Lives of the Mayfair Witches, #1)",0099471426,Anne Rice,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"The Witching Hour is absolutely amazing. I could not put it down. I could barely get myself to do anything else other than find out what happened next. Each page drew me in, increased my heart rate, and intensified my breathing. The family history is extraordinarily compelling. This is my favorite Anne Rice book."
1217,"The Witching Hour (Lives of the Mayfair Witches, #1)",0099471426,Anne Rice,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"The Mayfair Witches series books are absolute page-turners from start to finish.  You literally feel like you are transported to Louisiana and are walking through all the history with the characters.  I have never been so captivated by a book and so disappointed when I was through reading it.  However, you can definitely read this book over and over again."
1218,"This Present Darkness (Darkness, #1)",1581345283,Frank E. Peretti,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,I've read this book a dozen times.  It's one the best I've read.  I still get goosebumps on certain parts.  It really does emphasize the power of prayer.
1218,"This Present Darkness (Darkness, #1)",1581345283,Frank E. Peretti,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"The title is what got my attention, until I started reading it. The first few sentences got me into it. I would highly reccomend this story."
1218,"This Present Darkness (Darkness, #1)",1581345283,Frank E. Peretti,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"Frank Peretti is an amazing author!  When I picked up this book I did not expect anything really great, but boy was I wrong.  It is so cool how the book pertains to real life.  Peretti's whole theme is about searching for the truth, and I love it!  This book may be fiction, but a lot of the spiritual things in it are happening right now.  If you like Peretti's books, this is a book for you.  If you have never read one before, this is a great one to start with!"
1219,"The Coincidence of Callie & Kayden (The Coincidence, #1)",0000000000,Jessica Sorensen,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Anonymous,Did not enjoy. No real story to the book. Mathilde just not a solid character. Ending did not even come together as you might have hoped to salvage the time wasted on reading this book.
1219,"The Coincidence of Callie & Kayden (The Coincidence, #1)",0000000000,Jessica Sorensen,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Anonymous,I read the whole thing but found it weird.  Guess it was above me.
1219,"The Coincidence of Callie & Kayden (The Coincidence, #1)",0000000000,Jessica Sorensen,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Anonymous,I will be thinking about this one for a while.
1220,Fates and Furies,1594634475,Lauren Groff,Barnes and Noble,4.4,BANCHEE_READS,"This book has, and always will be, one of my all-time favorites! For any woman who has expirienced the ups and downs of growing up female and just trying to find your place in this world. I adored both Vix and Caitlin and found myself struggling to choose which one I identified with. Am I the smart and serious Vix or the spontaneous care-free Caitlin? I finally realized that parts of both of them are inside of me as most of us have found from time to time. From their first sexual encounters to picking husbands, Vix and Caitlin take you along with them as they venture through life. This book is not supposed to have a plot or a real climax. It is realistic story about friendship, love, and growing up. A must-read for anyone who has been blessed to know the true ups and downs of friendship....and in the end, the importance of sisterhood."
1220,Fates and Furies,1594634475,Lauren Groff,Barnes and Noble,4.4,sarahlr802,This is my favorite book. I have read this book too many times to count and always recommend it to my friends. I think this book should be made into a movie...
1220,Fates and Furies,1594634475,Lauren Groff,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"Summer Sisters is a book that takes place in the late 1970¿s and early 1980¿s. It¿s a course of over six summers. The two main characters in the book are Victoria Leonard and Caitlin Somers. The book starts off with Victoria working in New York City at her job when she receives phone call from her long lost best friend Caitlin. The phone call consists Caitlin telling Victoria about her wedding and asking her to be her maid of honor. The story then goes into a flash back to where Caitlin and Victoria first meet. It was late spring in 1977 when Caitlin approached ¿Vix¿ in their 6th grade class. Caitlin was the new girl, and Vix was the shy quiet girl. Caitlin bluntly asks Vix to spend the summer with her and her father down in Martha¿s Vineyard. Caitlin immediately jumped to the offer. The girls started their first summer together getting to know each other. The rest of the summer consists of the two girls having their summer crushes and the summer stories that are not to be spoken of. Over the course of the summer the girls pledge to be summer sisters for life. Years pass and the girls continue to spend each and every summer together. The girls continue their friendship even through college where Vix has a boyfriend from the Vineyard. Years pass and their friendship begins to fade, until the day Vix receives the phone from Caitlin¿."
1221,Summer Sisters,0440243750,Judy Blume,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"This book is exciting from the moment that you start. Poor Stuart Little is always smaller than everybody around him. But that makes him all the more better. He is a tough mouse with a lot of determination. If you liked the Stuart Little movies, then you will love the book."
1221,Summer Sisters,0440243750,Judy Blume,Barnes and Noble,4.1,lovebug21826,this was the best book ever.it was about Stuart trys to find his best friend ever(Marglo)so he has to go throw obsticuls to find her.i say go get the book and read it now!WOW!
1221,Summer Sisters,0440243750,Judy Blume,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,I suppose as charlotte's web had a series of talking animals so a talking mouse born to a human isn't that difficult to entertain.My daughter clearly enjoyed the story and didn't question the lack of logic or somewhat abrupt chapter/episode endings. But then she didn't demand it to be re-read again and again as she has with other books. I never read this before reading it to her so had no sentiment towards it...it is a nice children's book but can't say it would be a favourite. Still better than much else out there - though not sure that is saying much.
1222,Stuart Little,0064400565,"E.B. White, Garth Williams",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"Good for anyone who's interested in the field but does not have formal training in Mathmatics and / or Physics. If you find yourself on the discovery channel alot or the Science channel, this book is for you"
1222,Stuart Little,0064400565,"E.B. White, Garth Williams",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"Physicist and author, Brian Greene, discusses old and new insights in physics. Exploring spacetime, relativity, quantum mechanics, superstring theory and M-theory, among other topics, Greene attempts to illustrate what seems thus far to comprise the workings of the universe. Elegant Universe is an interesting enough read which nonetheless will not engage everyone and will leave many wondering. Because while the language and analogies are understandable even for those who are not mathematicians or scientists, the theories presented may be difficult to comprehend. Also, the book is probably more appealing to those who constantly ponder the micro- and macro- scopic universe or are concerned with the discovery of a T.O.E. (Theory of Everything) than to those looking for more tangible consequences of the micro- and macro-scopic on their immediate physical existences."
1222,Stuart Little,0064400565,"E.B. White, Garth Williams",Barnes and Noble,4.3,samschmidt,"Above all, this book has really helped me visualize theories that I had never really been able to understand before.  This book goes through Einstein's theories about relativity and the theory of quantum physics comprehensively and creatively.  Author Greene uses intriguing analogies and theoretical characters in order to explain why space must be curved, among other physics humdingers.  For those of us who were always interested but could never get through heavy, scientific snore books, this book is a godsend.  It deals with its subject matter intelligently, compellingly, and with a great deal of literary merit, which is all together too rare in science texts.  Science and literature are not mutually exclusive, and this book proves it.  I'm so glad that I took the time to read this."

So fa it is my seconed favorite book. I really think you should read it but make sure you read them in order because you won't understand it unless you do. So far I am on the seventh book and it is my favorite book.

1225,"The Austere Academy (A Series of Unfortunate Events, #5)",0064408639,"Lemony Snicket, Brett Helquist",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"I have read Seven on Top three times.  That should tell you more than you need to  know about me.  I love Janet Evanovich for the same reason I dislike so many other of her contemporaries: she doesn't write with pretense, she doesn't pretend she's writing heavy-duty, 'thinking person's' mysteries (see Tami Hoag or even Stephen King). Stephanie  Plum is really such a wonderful character, and such an endearing loser-trying-not-to-be-a-loser.  I identify with her, and I suspect a lot of others do as well.  Evanovich is such a marvel at creating seemingly simple characters, but giving them real 'life' on the page through the pure magic of  dialogue.  Look at DeChooch in this book -- you know this guy just by the way he talks.  You know his pals Ziggy and Benny are washed-up wise guys who are just trying to do that famous honorable thing.  Mooner is memorable, grandma Mazur is a hoot, as usual    the perfect Valerie   marvelous Lula (what would the series be without Lula?).  These characters and many more come to life through Evanovich's simple prose and dynamite dialogue.  All of us, I think, know or have known people like this.   I've read all of Evanovich's books, and they're wonderful.   I even like Ranger, Trenton's version of a one-line western Gary Cooper.  In this seventh novel, the evil women lurking in the background are really kind of scary.  I like the way Evanovich writes: it's smooth, seamless, deceptive.  She is very funny, yet we tend to forget that this kind of laugh-out-loud funny is extremely difficult to do.  Just try it sometime if you doubt it.  I can imagine that wildly funny and ancient grandma Mazur in my mind, that bag of bones with the innocent yet blunt mouth ('his penis is kinda dead').  She's so 'real,' as so many other Evanovich characters are 'real'.     I knew a crazy woman like grandma Mazur when I was a kid: she would hang around funeral homes and get royally pissed off over a closed casket.  And yes: she was once caught trying to pry one open.  Even Evanovich's dog Bob is hilarious.  And what hero has a hamster for a pet?  Janet's a terrifically imaginative writer with a natural gift for humor, and in Stephanie Plum she has created an indelible hero(ine) who just stays with you.  The reader is pulling for Stephanie all the way.  We want her to succeed.  She's so vulnerable, but so honest, decent and hard-working.  She's always at odds with herself, wondering what her next move should be.  I love characters like that.  Life ain't easy, and Stephanie knows it.   We can really identify with someone who is so flawed.  If we look closely at ourselves, we too are decent, honest, etc., but we too are flawed.  Stephanie always tries to do her best, and so does her creator, Evanovich.  Can't understand why Plum hasn't been made into a movie. She's even ideal material for a tv series.  Evanovich now faces the same problem so many other writers face: her own success.  When you create a great character (and group of characters), where do you go from here?  I love Evanovich's books, and I look forward to no. 11 in the continuing round of Plum (mis)adventures."
1225,"The Austere Academy (A Series of Unfortunate Events, #5)",0064408639,"Lemony Snicket, Brett Helquist",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"This is my second go round with this collection. I read it about 2 years ago. I could hardly get off the floor I laughed so hard. I feel she could have left out Valerie and the kids, they really did nothing to help the book. Of course the competition between Morelli and Ranger gets hotter and hotter. I can't decide which I like better, they are both so hot. Stephanie is the most hilarious accident prone, misfortunate bounty hunter who if she didn't have bad luck she'd have no luck at all. Start from book one and wear a diaper because I guarantee you will pee your pants."
1225,"The Austere Academy (A Series of Unfortunate Events, #5)",0064408639,"Lemony Snicket, Brett Helquist",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Bookworm1951,Best in the series so far.  I have to agree with one reviewer that there seemed to be too many nonessential characters thrown in which made it somewhat confusing at times.  Stephanie's character is evolving and seems to have matured some.  At least she doesn't act like a total fool all the time in this book.  She's still a terrible bounty hunter but that seems to be part of her charm.  Great for story telling but unbelievable in a real life scenario.
1226,"Seven Up (Stephanie Plum, #7)",0312980140,Janet Evanovich,Barnes and Noble,4.5,katiesbookblog,"Chloe Saunders is back in the second book of the Darkest Powers series.  If you haven't read The Summoning yet read it before reading this review.  SPOILERS.

At the end of the first book Chloe and Rae go to Chloe's Aunt Lauren for help, not knowing that she is working for the very group that they are trying to escape from.  As a result, Chloe and Rae end up locked in a high security warehouse that houses the Edison Groups many experiments.  Luckily, Derek and Simon are still on the run and on the lookout for Chloe and Rae.

After encountering ghosts of some of the former Lyle House occupants Chloe decides to take matters into her own hands and figure out a way to escape, this time for good.  With the help of Liz's ghost and a trapped demi-demon Chloe manages to find more information about the Edison group and how she can possibly escape from them.

Once away from the Edison group Chloe is forced to face the reality of living on the run with nowhere and nobody to turn to other than Tori, Derek, and Simon.  Her father has posted a $500,000 reward for her safe return and the Edison group is no longer worried about keeping any of them alive.

Will Chloe and the others be able to outrun the Edison group or will their luck finally run out?  Will Chloe ever figure out what her true feelings are for Derek and Simon?

The Darkest Powers series is full of paranormal happenings, betrayal, and budding romance.  I highly recommend this series for any fans of the Twilight series.  Definitely not the same story line but just as good."

The author makes the book hard to put down. You can get lost in this book. I finished it in one day because I couldnt put it down. I hope you fond this review helpful.
1226,"Seven Up (Stephanie Plum, #7)",0312980140,Janet Evanovich,Barnes and Noble,4.5,RAVEN_BIRD,"The book the Awakening was even better then the summoning. While in the summoning you are kept wating a bit to progress to the big exciting part the awakening starts off pretty well. I enjoyed this book very much and could not put it down, it is a fast read (for me I guss) and is written really well. I would suggest this book for grades six and up becuse you have to pay attention to certin events well to understand things. Overall very good book.

1227,"The Awakening (Darkest Powers, #2)",0061662763,Kelley Armstrong,Barnes and Noble,4.6,amslogos,"Each story of the Dresden Files follows the life of Harry Dresden, Chicago's very own professional Wizard. In a nutshell, Harry is a warrior-wizard who protects the citizenry of Chicago from vamps, zombies, demons, evil faeries (like his godmother...), trolls, and more, while flying under the radar of the White Council's grey-cloaked hit squad, the Wardens. But this is strictly pro-bono. He scrapes a living by presenting paranormal solutions for private cases of the weird and supernatural. He also serves Chicago PD by offering ""consultant work"" to Special Investigations (the force's answer to ""unsolvable"" paranormal crimes, populated by cops who are better at their jobs than their superiors [and, naturally, shunted into a Junk Job...]) while providing us with gut-busting wit. Genre buffs will enjoy salted allusions to Sci Fi culture icons. In Death Masks (#5), Harry teams up with the Holy Knights against the Fallen to save Chicago (and a good portion of the entire planet) from terrifying death. The story quickly evolves as Harry involuntarily destroys a TV talkshow studio, dodges bullets, works with the Vatican, and comes to grips with the fact that, sometimes, we are no match for our enemies and must lean on Faith. Psychotic nymphomaniacs, mute blood-servant henchmen, ravening animals, personal sacrifice, and an excellent scene involving a baseball bat keep you rooted to the toil and triumph of this Holy-Grail type tale."
1227,"The Awakening (Darkest Powers, #2)",0061662763,Kelley Armstrong,Barnes and Noble,4.6,MicheleLeesBookLove,"The king of complicated, Chicago's only professional wizard is back in Butcher's fifth Dresden Files novel. Harry agrees to go on a paranormal talk show to meet a man who's been searching for Susan, his half-vampire love. But he gets more than he bargained for when all the other guests are there to meet him in a neutral public places as well. There's a count of the Red Court there to challenge Harry to a duel in an effort to end the war between the Red Court vampires and the White Counsel which rules the wizards. And there's also a priest from the Catholic Church who wants to hire Dresden to find the stolen Shroud of Turin. On the way out a hit man from Chicago's top mob boss tries to kill Harry, and Detective Murphy calls, wanting Harry to help out with a strange murder case.
	Harry's not alone though. Susan shows back up (and saves his skin a number of times) with half-vampire powers. And Michael is back, with the other sacred sword-wielding Knights of the Cross. The latter is an element that's done especially well as Butcher manages to take a world where fairies and werewolves and vampires are real and also write beautiful, strong Christian characters instead of flat, stereotypical antagonists wearing crosses.
	The Dresden books are quite popular, and despite being cautious in a urban fantasy-over run world, are very good as well. Dresden might have started out as a parody of UF, but Butcher's strength in complex storytelling and just as vivid and complex characters pushed this series up to a ringleader of the UF gang. It's also a fantastic addition in the sense that it brings a much needed male point of view to the genre, without excluding female characters as strong and capable on their own. Highly recommended for public collections as these books give back a great amount for their purchase price.

	Contains: violence, some gore, sex, language"

Nancy Horan does an amazing job, starting with her exhaustive research, in bringing these two characters back to life with all their warts.  The enigma for me is that a woman depicted as being ahead of her time in espousing women's rights would sacrifice everything dear to her for the ""love"" of a man.  With her intelligence and many wonderful gifts, Mamah could have lead a rich and exciting life; but instead, she ended up living a life secluded from the things and people she loved most.  Whether it was her intention or not, the author does a good job of showing how decisions we make based on our own needs and gratification can have  far reaching and unexpected consequences for those close to us and even for peripheral persons in our lives.  The ending was unexpected and jarring.  I loved this book for many reasons which surprised me because, as I said, I could not like Mamah or Frank.  A great bood for discussion!"

We liked the historical pictures, newspaper clippings, and the fascinating insight the author delved into concerning the architectural works of the brilliant Frank Lloyd Wright. While loving Frank, and walking away from all she had by way of traditional motherhood and marriage, Maymah portrays a woman who is progressive, yet scandalized. One of the better books for a provocative discussion over coffee, for those of us who lived the women's rights movements, and still bemoan the glass ceiling... still discussing women's issues, as we venture along the way to the next rural homemakers club!

From the time of therapy to the time of book release was 19 years not a grand master plan if you're trying to exploit someone. No I believe Sybil's story was real and that she was a truly remarkable and unique individual. The writing style of the author captured me instantly there wasn't too much of anything whether it is personal or textbook psychiatric information. It had the write balance and kept me intrigued from beginning to end. It also posed a lot of questions which I am sure have been asked in the past what causes people with two similar backgrounds to mentally handle things completely different why do some disassociate and others not. I can tell you this I had been waiting a very long time to read this book and I was not disappointed in fact it made me intensely aware that this disease can be so extreme. I can't imagine what this woman went through as the one woman who is supposed to love you unconditionally destroys your whole being. Great book excellently written I would definitely recommend.

A great thing about this book is that it IS filled with lots of information, but the way Carl Sagan presents it makes it easier to understand and he even put foot notes about how certain scientific numbers were calculated, for those who like seeing HOW things are done.

Few sections of science go ignored in this book even though each topic is covered thoroughly and intelligibly. Along with the many relevant facts, Sagan gives his thoughtful analysis and insight to make everything crystal clear. What I most like about Cosmos is how the knowledge introduced is done so in a poetic way which spices it up from being like a textbook and makes it seem like a work of art. Furthermore, Sagan's delivery instigates very profound and spectacular thought of the wonder of how the world works and how well humanity could exist compared to the present. This book is seriously full of mind blowing information that is just plain fun to think about. The most endearing part of this book is how it is written with so much heart, passion, and fervor. If there is anything to complain about it'd be that some parts require numerous re-readings to fully comprehend as some of the concepts are so difficult to grasp. If you are thinking about reading this book then you must. You learn so much from this book and as the adage goes, ""knowledge is power"". All joking aside, this is a really enjoyable book because it really makes you think and it paints the picture of how beautiful and wonderful the world, the universe, and mere existence are!

1235,Cosmos,0375508325,Carl Sagan,Barnes and Noble,3.8,avanders,"This was my first Palahniuk. I had heard that this book was incredibly disturbing and was, of course, intrigued. The book was disturbing, I suppose, but I would not add the modifier ""incredibly."" The book is, however, graphic and detailed and delves into the more deranged parts of the human mind. Although I had not read Palahniuk before, I have of course seen Fight Club, and I understand that Palahniuk takes extreme situations and explores human interactions and reactions within those situations. Haunted does this and takes it just one step beyond ""the line.""

The way I think of the book is as a warped reality tv show gone wrong. Imagine a group of people, psychologically messed up because of the realities inflicted upon them and because of the choices they have made. Lock them together in a building with no escape for three months and see what happens. It's like The Cube meets Saw. Palahniuk's characters are actually believable in their extreme behavior and those with weaker stomachs should refrain.

The format the book takes is relatively unique. The characters in the book are identified by nicknames that somehow represent how the author is warped. Each ""chapter"" includes a narrative, a poem, and a story. The narrative is told from the perspective of one of the individuals locked in the building -- though we are never quite sure which aspiring author is speaking. The narrative is followed by a poem ""about"" the aspiring author, which hints at something the author has experienced and sheds a little light on the nickname the author has received. The poem is then followed by a story written by the character that has been discussed in the preceding poem. The story explains the primary traumatic incident (or portion of that incident) that resulted in the author's warped personality and nickname.

I liked the format of the book and appreciated Palahniuk's timing. Some of the most intriguing (to me) characters' personalities and nicknames were revealed at the end of the book, which certainly kept me attached to the book -- even though it almost read more like a series of non-related short stories than a novel. In addition, although it was not immediate, I was eventually drawn into the narrative of the authors trapped in the building and felt invested in how it would all play out.

The writing was great, too. I suppose the reason I'm still rambling about this, somewhat incoherently, is because I recognize the good qualities of the book, cannot think of any particularly bad ones, but still was not blown away by the book. I expected to be more disturbed, more intrigued, more saddened, more anything... but mostly I was just reading without much emotion at all. It was certainly good enough to continue reading and good enough to casually recommend, but it made no strong lasting impressions on me.

Recommended for someone who likes gore and exploring the deranged ways in which humans can behave in extreme situations.

THREE AND A HALF out of five stars."

He comes up with stories that titilate the mind while churning the stomach. Unfortunately, this latest 'novel' should have remained just a collection of intriguing -- yet disturbing -- short stories.     In 'Haunted,' Palahniuk tries to weave them all together by creating a storyline between each short story that features the characters in each of the short stories. Unfortunately, it's this ongoing storyline that is the weakest part of the book, as it lost this reader's interest. In addition to this ongoing storyline, there are poems about each of the characters that I could have done without before each of the short stories.     While the ongoing storyline of characters 'trapped' inside a house had a couple of interesting moments, it's the short stories that truly make this book worth having in your collection."

What I thought was a 'mom' book, soon turned into my favorite book of all time. Fifteen years later, I am still hugely in debt to Rosamunde for sharing her skill and imagination with me throughout all of her books. (I own them all.)   I re-read them often as the mood strikes and am always filled with a renewed sense of appreciation for her imagery and depth of character. I feel an absurd connection with Cornwall that I use as my 'imaginary vacation spot'.     Her beautiful stories are appropriate for such a broad age-range. The Shell Seeker's is original in that it does not contain any sexual content that would be objectionable.    Lovely first novel for anyone!!!"

Almost without exception they're hardworking, intelligent, kind, and fun-loving guys. In fact, most of them know Achak Deng (the man the book is based on) and lived much of what he lived. The story of Achak Deng in and of itself is captivating and moving but Eggers deftly crafted the story and the dialogue to vividly bring him to life.

Yet this one is done so smoothly and thoroughly to allow us to feel connected and learn more about the realities of refugee existence, war, transitioning to a new country like America, and then ultimately giving back to the Sudanese village that truly has needs.  

I appreciate the story told to the various persons Achak meets in his daily encounters in life in America. As so many immigrants and refugees do, especially a dark tall Sudanese man, they get asked so many questions about their lives.  It was easy to picture him at the health centre chatting about his incredible history in the most simple of terms to a woman on her way to her seemingly meaningless challenges in comparison - to lose weight, get one more mile in, lift an extra five pounds, etc. She could never understand in a two-minute chat, unless she reads the book!"

1240,"A Scandal in Bohemia (The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, #1)",0582416396,"Ronald Holt, Arthur Conan Doyle",Barnes and Noble,3.9,SBrizek,"I like Bill O'Reilly very much. He has done the people a great service by having many who know little or nothing at all about the subject of this book induced to learn about it and perhaps to become interested in that subject in a way that never would have been possible had not HE been its author. But those folks deserved better.

I am someone who knows a great deal about this subject and, as such, when reading this book, contrary to never feeling as though I could not put it down, I found myself instead periodically feeling like throwing it across the room. Why? Because of the agonizingly regular appearance of errors. Errors matter because when one comes across information which, despite years of study of a subject, appears to be new, instead of celebrating the discovery of that new information or the appreciation of having understood an old story from a new perspective because of that new information, one is left with the overriding suspicion that the new information is not new at all, but only appears to be so because it is not true.

Some examples: Booth did not bore a peep hole in the wall of the hallway leading to the Presidential Box at Ford's Theater, he bore that hole in a door, a door which is there at Ford's Theater to this very day for anyone who visits the site to see for himself. Did Mr. O'Reilly visit Ford's Theater?

Mr. O'Reilly concludes his account of the surrender at Appomattox by observing that Grant and Lee would never meet again, when, in fact, they met the next day and conducted follow-up surrender negotiations on horseback, and met again in 1869 when Lee visited the White House to confer with Grant after he became President.

Mr. O'Reilly tells of Grant, upon returning to Washington from City Point, going over to the White House to see Lincoln and meeting with him in the Oval Office. There was no Oval Office in 1865, and there would not be one until the 20th Century. Grant met with Lincoln in Lincoln's office on the second floor of the White House where today is located the room called the ""Lincoln Bedroom"".

Details like these are important: Why else include them in the book in the first place? When details worthy for inclusion in the book are inaccurate the inaccuracies matter when they accumulate to the point where the credibility of the entire enterprise is put at risk and the book's reliability becomes suspect.That point is reached in this book.

The book needed vetting it never received, and suffers as a result. The folks who read this book and put it down having learned a story they never before knew or fully appreciated might now be inspired to learn more about that story. The regret is that Mr. O'Reilly did not do a better job of giving them the head start he probably intended for them to have in order to succeed in that worthy effort."
1240,"A Scandal in Bohemia (The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, #1)",0582416396,"Ronald Holt, Arthur Conan Doyle",Barnes and Noble,3.9,JohnCharlesBerry,"This review is written by John Berry, author of ""A Night of Horrors,"" a historical thriller on the 24 hours of Lincoln's assassination.

O'Reilly and Dugard have written a book on the assassination that is part thriller and part history book.  Their stated intent was to write ""a thriller"" but one that remains ""unsanitized and uncompromising"" in its veracity.  Though the title indicates that the book will focus on the assassination itself, it actually covers a span of several months, including the weeks leading up to the day of the shooting and the months following when the conspirators were rounded up and tried.  While the facts and sequences discussed in Killing Lincoln are mostly accurate, the narrative moves along quickly and breezily, which makes for a quick read.  The problem for me is that the subject of the book is weighty and meaningful, but the narrative skims along the surface.  While O'Reilly and Dugard touch on many themes and issues that America faced as it struggled to end the bloodiest war in our history and reinstate the rebel states, they treat none of them in depth.  They touch on a few of the many conspiracies that Americans love to debate when it comes to the Lincoln (and Kennedy, for that matter) assassinations.  They raise many questions or potential themes, but delve into none in great detail or with any satisfaction.

Also, the authors continually narrate from the viewpoint of how events unfolded.  So every action of Lincoln, in particular, are interpreted and painted with a fatalistic brush.  For instance, we have this on the morning of the shooting.  ""Every aspect of Lincoln's early morning has the feel of a man putting his affairs in order:  reading the Bible, jotting a few notes, arranging for a last carefree whirl around Washington with his loyal wife, and setting his son on a path that will ensure him a successful future.  All of this is done unconsciously, of course, but it is notable.""  In reality, Lincoln did many of these things every morning of the war.  His habit, as the authors themselves point out, is to read from the Bible daily.  He often went first to his office to tend to paperwork and then downstairs for breakfast.  His carriage ride with his wife and his advice to his son occur because the war was coming to an end and not because he knew it was the last day of his life.  But the authors can't seem to help themselves in over-writing and over-noting how coincidental things look in the light of the assassination.

The narrative is often painted with purple prose.  My favorite is the opening to Chapter 32: ""Two thousand years after the execution of Jesus, there are still many unanswered questions about who was directly responsible for his death and what happened in the aftermath.  And so it is, on Good Friday 1865, that a series of bizarre occurrences will take place.""

All in all, the book proves a frustrating read for a serious historian as it never dives too deeply into issues, characters, or themes.  In their attempt to write both a history book and a thriller, they don't quite achieve either.  ""Killing Lincoln"" does have a strong narrative drive and raises conspiracy questions that will prove of interest to some readers.  But I came away feeling that O'Reilly and Dugard had missed the mark and never really provided any new insight or emotion into one of the most important 24 hour periods of our country."
1240,"A Scandal in Bohemia (The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, #1)",0582416396,"Ronald Holt, Arthur Conan Doyle",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"I don't have all night to list the errors in this book. Save your money and just purchase ""They Have Killed Papa Dead"" or ""Manhunt"" for accurate portrayals of the events surrounding Lincoln's assasination. I can't believe O'Reilly is touting this book on talk shows as ""ALL TRUE."" Just a few examples of errors....1) He states Grant and Lee never meet again after Lee surrenders at Appomatox. False - they meet the next day to go over details and also again after Grant is president. 2) Chapter 40 states that Phillip Barton Key is married to a woman and is killed by her LOVER, with whom she is having an affair. This is backwards....Phillip Barton Key is the LOVER, not the husband, although he is killed by the husband. As a side note, the husband/killer is Dan Sickles, a former Union General who is the first to use the defense of ""Not Guilty by Reason of Temporary Insanity"" for his murder of Key. 3) The book states Booth blocked the door with a music stand. If O'Reilly simply went to Ford's Theater, he could see the wooden stick on display RIGHT NOW that Booth used to block the door. 4) The book states that Booth drilled a hole in the door the same afternoon that he killed Lincoln, so he could view Lincoln that night before assasinating him. This is a myth that is disputed also by visiting Ford's theater. The manager had drilled the hole long before that night to be able to view all of his VIP guests to ensure they were happy. 5) The book claims the actress who cradled Lincoln's head in her lap, and thus had his blood all over her dress, was haunted by this the rest of her life. In fact, she later held parties and modeled the dress to party attendees to show it off. Even later still, she cut up parts of the dress to give away as souvenirs to her favorite relatives and friends. 6) O'Reilly describes Mrs. Lincoln wore a gray dress to the play, when in fact she wore a black taffeta dress. 

As stated previously, there were too many errors to detail every one in this review. It was sloppy research, if there was research at all. Well-respected non-fiction writers use footnotes, but there are none in this book. Even in history class, I had to use footnotes on papers I submitted. I was looking forward to reading this book, but was seriously disappointed!"
1241,Killing Lincoln: The Shocking Assassination that Changed America Forever,0805093079,"Bill O'Reilly, Martin Dugard",Barnes and Noble,3.6,Anonymous,"It shocks me that anyone could find this book anything less than breathtaking. Admittedly, the first third or so of the book takes some getting used too;  Lahiri is leaping into territory that will be simply unfamiliar with many readers, and the time she takes to  lay her foundeation will likely strike some as tedious.
That being said, once you are through the first 4 chapters or so, the book simply takes flight. The winding journey of each of her characters is so painful, so human, I could not pit the book down, and at times, I openly want to weep. I honestly think this book is as stunning as Lahiri's other work, perhaps her greatest, most significant work yet. If you have not read this cover to cover, I would do so as soon as you can."

But when I finally bit the bullet I was not disappointed. The book is one of the few books where I have laughed out loud. It is also very suspenseful and has plenty of action scenes. The plot is great and the characters such as Will and Halt are great. You wish you could just live in their world for a day and meet them. 
Flanagan does a great job and this book is one of my favorites in my library."

Even many days after reading WINTERGIRLS, I still shiver when I think about this book. Lia has struggled with an eating disorder before. Her parents think that she is getting better, but she is just fooling everyone. When Cassie, who used to be her best friend, dies, Lia spirals out of control again. She eats less and less and begins seeing Cassie's ghost everywhere. WINTERGIRLS explores the world of eating disorders with vivid, horrifying detail. Even though this book was really creepy, it was also spectacular. I had never understood how or why some people began to have eating disorders, and this book gave a spectacular insight into their state of mind."
1243,"The Ruins of Gorlan (Ranger's Apprentice, #1)",0142406635,John Flanagan,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"Not only was this book an excellent portrayal of a teenager with anorexia but it also was a an extensive view into the mind of a cutter and someone who deals with hallucinations. This book may be hard to read for some people. If you are thinking about reading it, make sure that you are...i guess mentally prepared for it. It can be extremely heart wrenching. But if you do decide to read it...you won't be disappointed. I loved reading every minute of it. Lia's character is sarcastic and can be quite funny at times. I would recommend this book to anyone."
1243,"The Ruins of Gorlan (Ranger's Apprentice, #1)",0142406635,John Flanagan,Barnes and Noble,4.4,SeeMichelleRead,"Laurie Halse Anderson is not one to shy away from difficult topics. Her debut novel Speak deals with the issue of teen rape was lets just say it was incredible. In her latest, Wintergirls, Anderson deftly addresses the devastating effects of eating disorders.

Wintergirls is the story of Lia who daily fights a battle between herself and food. She's already been hospitalized twice for her eating disorder where she played the 'recovery game' until doctors and parents were satisfied and gave her enough breathing room to go back to her old habits. It's the one thing Lia constantly concentrates on in the midst of divorced parents who are too busy to notice her and school that doesn't really matter. How many calories (or lack there of) each day. How much she exercises. But then Lia begins to face the realities of her choices when she finds out that her (ex)best friend, Cassie, who also had an eating disorder, has died. As she stumbles deeper into grief, Lia tries to determine not the reason why Cassie killed herself, but why not?

What amazes me is how accurately Anderson is able to portray a teenager who feels constantly at odds with her family, herself and especially food. She is so isolated, so alone with the pain and destructive feelings in her head it seems to the reader she'll never be able to pull herself out. Lia's isolation is underscored by her nightly visits to supersecret and honestly so competely depressing online chat groups for anorexic/bulimic girls who discuss their struggle to lose that last 10, 15, even 25 pounds. Nameless girls who like Lia try to control the chaos of their lives by controlling their body.

Wintergirls was not an easy read nor was it easy to put down. I alternated between pity, depression and down right horror at the things Lia put herself and consequently, her family through. Though this is a teen novel, I would hesitate to give it to just any teen girl - it's something that needs to be digested with a little bit of maturity and sensitivity. But was it a heartbreaking beautiful novel that will stick with me a long time? Absolutely.

1244,Wintergirls,067001110X,Laurie Halse Anderson,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,I take my time with good novels and never speed read an author such as Grisham.  His wording and vocabulary are superb  to the point that you can feel the character's heartbeat.  This really is a great book.  I am surprised by the negetive reviews.  I've had it for two years now and it is always one I re-read while waiting on the next thriller.  The story line is the same but I never tire of it.  And so it goes I remain a fan forever.
1245,The Brethren,0385339674,John Grisham,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"I will agree with some of the other reviewers that the 3rd book in the series came across....lacking compared to the first 2 books. I found Fitz actions over the top sometimes, ridiculous others and downright ignorant most of the time. The new characters were a bit of dissapointment also. As for the ending, I would definitely agree that it dragged on to the point of forcing myself to finish the book. I feel odd giving this review because the past 2 books were sensational but I felt this book was tired and weak compared to the first 2. Still great to some levels but overall not as sharp as the others."
1245,The Brethren,0385339674,John Grisham,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"I must say that I am surprised by the reviews for this one. I think Robin Hobb is a sensational writer. The characters were likable and complimented each other in the first two books of this series. And then came this book. Ugh...very, very, very disappointed. Kettle and Starling fit into this story like the Pope at a porn star convention. Fitz' stay with the other Witted was lacking and, I felt, was incomplete. The search for the Elderlings dragged on terribly. The ending, while uncoventional, left me disappointed because of the dragged out search and creation of the Elderlings that preceded it.     Great first 2 books + bad last book = good series."
1245,The Brethren,0385339674,John Grisham,Barnes and Noble,4.2,deesy58,"This is the third, and last, book of the ""Farseer"" trilogy.  It is written in the style of Stephen R. Donaldson, with the main character possessing the attributes of an anti-hero.  FitzChivalry is blissfully unaware of the events swirling around him.  He ignores the advice of his mentors, stumbling perpetually into one ambush or unfortunate incident after another.  He seems totally unable to plan, to assess his environment, to perceive danger, or to make reasoned decisions.  He fails to exercise due caution, even though he is aware that enemies are seeking to kill him.  This calamitous book is almost painful to read.  The only anticipation available to a reader is the wonder as to what kind of mess our hero will find himself in next.  The ending is a bit anticlimactic.  The book is, however, well-written with very few editing errors.  The story is well-told and entertaining.  The main character's denseness and lack of awareness make him unsympathetic in my opinion."

1246,"Assassin's Quest (Farseer Trilogy, #3)",0553565699,Robin Hobb,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"Reads like some of the most eccentric entries from The New Yorker. Much like Talk of the Town, the story slowly unravels from the pictaresque beginnings of a couple apartment hunting in NYC, to Rosemary's feminine hysteria manifested throughout her pregnancy. 

Ira Levin just knows how to craft the proper thriller, ending every chapter with reader left with the want of knowing what will happen next. Classic gothic horror that doesn't rely on cheap tricks to further the plot or tension. The occult topics are never overkilled."

If you are a newbie, then you need to start with On the Road. Dharma Bums makes sense if you've read OtR first. If not, it is difficult to make sense of this book. However, Dharma Bums is interesting to read. Kerouac's take on Buddhism may not be straight out of the Shambala Center but it is close to how many Westerners are introduced to Buddhism. Plus, the story is fun to follow. The guy can tell a story."
1249,"The Path of Daggers (Wheel of Time, #8)",0812550293,Robert Jordan,Barnes and Noble,4.2,seanbrustuen,"I read this book because I wanted to have a basic understanding of Jack Kerouac&rsquo;s style of writing and I came away from it enlightened on the big ideas of Buddhism.  Recognized as one of Jack Kerouac&rsquo;s most famous books, The Dharma Bums chronicles the Buddhist wanderer Raymond Smith as he travels around the country searching for spiritual truth and wisdom.  Smith Hitchhikes his way from San Francisco to his hometown in North Carolina and all along the way breaking away from the conformity of middle-class America.  Through the practice of spending as little money as possible, Smith learns that it is unnecessary to slip into the average everyday routines and grows deeper into his understanding that his role on Earth is only temporary.  Once spring time came around, Smith began his trek westward to the shores of California to reunite in a small cabin with his spiritual mentor Japhy Ryder.  I found it very interesting to get into the mind of Jack Kerouac and have a glimpse into how he was living in the 1950s. The Buddhist perspective presented in this book offers insight into how simply a life can be lived.  This book is a great book to take your time on and enjoy slowly while learning the simple lessons that is offered throughout the book.  What I took from this story is that God is found in the simplest forms.  The closer you can get to the raw elements of nature, the more real the truth becomes."

It's an awesome book filled with action, adventure, and a lil romance. I'm not gonna lie though, I was a lil disappointed with the end, I think Tori should have gotten to know the big secret about her life,(you'll find out what I'm talking about if you read the book) and we should have gotten to see that in this series.Also the cover didn't really fit the book too much, in this whole book her hair was dyed and not it's natural color strawberry blond like in the other books, I think they should have shown that, I'm too paticular with deatils like that LOL! Of course the rest of the book and the whole series at that is just plain awesome, there's no other word that can describe it so well to me. It's AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME!!!!! You can probably see how much I like this whole series by now.Genetically altered Chloe the necromancer, Derek the werewolf, Tori the witch, and Simon the sorcerer are finally away and out of the clutches of the Edison Group. Now safe and sound, or so they think, they start to get suspicious and get answers to questions they seek. Derek completes the change into a werewolf, Chloe is being bothered by a pesky poltergeist and realizes she has feelings for Derek, and all the while the people they trusted to help them are showing their true intentions.

I watched the movie made by Walt Disney and thought it would be cool to read the book. The book is really good too! Just to correct anyone, Mary Poppins is meant to be 27 years old by P.L. Travers. Yeah, I thought she was old at first too. But the book is about this nanny who comes and changes the Banks childrens' lives. She makes everything fun and lively and is like no other nanny. I'd reccommend this book to everyone as it's really a delightful story."
1252,"Behind the Beautiful Forevers: Life, Death, and Hope in a Mumbai Undercity",1400067553,Katherine Boo,Barnes and Noble,4,Cougar_H,"I would highly recommend the novel Mary Poppins by P.L. Travers.  This book had all the elements of a good children's novel.  It was humorous, magical, and lets your imagination roam.  This book was a series of adventures all coming together to make a wonderful story.
	I would recommend this book because it is based out of a British time period where many children have not been taught about this culture.  Mary Poppins was a strict nanny that the children were not only scared of her but also loved her.  She took the children on many magical adventures.  Mary Poppins was magical, but only used her magic when the four children behaved.  If they did the right thing good magic would happen.  If they were naughty, bad magic might happen, or even the magic would not come at all.  At the beginning of the story you believe that Mary Poppins does not love the children and is mean to them.  By the end of the story, you are able to see her big heart and her loving ways.
	If you are looking to read a book that is based on the movie, do not read this one.  It is way different than the movie.  For instance, Mary Poppins is not a cheerful and happy young Nanny that swoops in to save the day.  She is proper, demanding, bossy, and strict.  Also, there are four children in the book instead two compared to the movie.  There are still Michael and Jane with a set of one year old twins.  These children try to behave, and Mary Poppins makes sure of it.  The book is much more realistic of the British times and I enjoyed reading it more than watching the movie.  
	Even though this book is way different than the movie, it is still a good children's novel as it lets an imagination run wild.  There are many magical moments like when Mary gives the children their medicine with a flavor of their choice or the children wandering into paintings.  This book is great.  Go and buy it for your children today."

The style that Cisneros uses in this book is amazing. I would recommend this book for anyone. I also plan on teaching this book in my classroom in the coming years.
1254,"Red Seas Under Red Skies (Gentleman Bastard, #2)",0553804685,Scott Lynch,Barnes and Noble,3.6,aKacia_Tree,"In The House on Mango Street Esperanza, a 12 year old girl, tells her tale in short vignettes.  She tells us what it is like to grow up in a neighborhood that is poverty-ridden. Esperanza tried to not be afraid of the neighborhood that she was confined to, but at times I could tell how scared she was. All she wanted was out and to make something of herself. This is an intricate coming of age tale. One that you have to analyze before you can understand it as a whole. 	The author, Sandra Cisneros, tried to sound like an authentic 12 year old girl. In my opinion, she tried a bit too hard and it showed. However, once I was able to get over the initial shock of the writing style and into the story, it was rather interesting. Another thing that caught my eye about this book is that most everyone can identify with it. Most people have had to overcome struggles in their lives; some similar to Esperanza¿s and some not. But, overall we have to learn how to overcome them. When Esperanza finally figured out how to overcome her struggles I felt happy for her. However, I was disappointed because it seemed so obvious from the beginning of the book what conclusion she was going to come to. 	Esperanza¿s personality was very interesting for me as the reader. This 12 year old seemed so self centered and superficial at times, I literally wanted to jump out of my seat and tell her to, ¿Knock it off.¿ (I refrained from doing so.) On the other hand, all of the other characters in the book were flat, as if they did not matter. I think they all needed more of a background; afterall they helped shape her into who she turned out to be at the end of the book. The plot was dull and hardly present. The book jumped around with each vignette and it was easy to stop caring about the book when it had no real plot. The setting was the most interesting for me as the reader. It drew me in during the first vignette. However, it never went into great depth about the setting. That was a major disappointment. I lost a lot of interest in the book once I realized that the author was not going to have the main character focus on the setting throughout the book.	Overall, I really needed to analyze the book afterward to draw a conclusion about how I felt about it. That conclusion is that it had no effect on my life; it did not move me to change my actions or to re-think my life like so many books do. It was an okay book but not awe inspiring for me. I would not recommend this book. There are many other books that are written better, on this same subject. I would recommend that you go read one of them instead."

1255,The House on Mango Street,0679734775,Sandra Cisneros,Barnes and Noble,4.3,The_Alternative,"City of Thieves is a coming-of-age voyage (to find a dozen eggs no less) in the war torn city of Leningrad, Russia. It is the winter of 1941 and the German Army has besieged the city. Rations are non-existent, citizens are dying by the hundreds, and everyone lives in fear of being overrun by the enemy. They have no alternative but to fight for survival. Lev and Kolya, young teen-age Russians, are arrested, Lev for looting a dead paratrooper, and Kolya for desertion. With their arrests both are destined to take a short trip that ends with their backs poised against a wall brushed with blood. But before their execution in the face of a firing squad they are given a reprieve by the city's acting military commander. They are ordered on a mission to find a dozen eggs for the colonel's daughter's wedding cake. They are given less than a week to complete their task and their ration cards are confiscated. Without a means of obtaining food what else can they do but try and fulfill the task. But in a city that has resorted to cannibalism where could they possibly find what they search for? The story develops as the two young men head off in search of the prized components.

Based on the true-life adventures of Benioff's grandfather we are transported to a city that has fallen on the hardest of times. Starvation, desperation, and self-preservation are the only law in Leningrad and that image of desolation and destruction lays the groundwork for the rest of the story. The quest for eggs takes them to a private whore house in the woods, to Russian partisans in the rural outskirts of the city, and to a German military camp where the final stand-off is played over a chess set. Benioff explores the grief and indifference of the characters while they hide from snipers, infiltrate a line of captured prisoners and eventually find what they were looking for. Peace!

This is a true heart-rending story written with love, care and consideration. Well worth the read.

I gotta say, for the readers that are too shy to ask, there aren't as many sex scenes (erotica is a guilty pleasure of mine! Hence the lack of that fifth star) & they aren't as explicit as, for example, Lora Leigh's Breed series, but the connection/attraction/romance between Cat and Bones is enough to give me butterflies at times. Definitely touching enough to keep me reading!! I'm VERY happy with this series & I hope beyond hope that Jeaniene Frost keeps up the wonderful pace and relationship with Cat and Bones. I'm a sucker for a happy ending. This series in ongoing too, so that's a plus!! Books to look forward to. :~) P.S To be 100% FAIR, if I wasn't such a pervert (LOL!!) I would give this book 5 stars!!"

Patterson and DeJong jump from scene-to-scene, as if they were preparing a story summary from which a movie script could be written (as I'm sure one is). They never stop in one spot long enough to build depth in any character or scene. Jack, the narrator, is fairly likable and convincing, and his grandfather Mack is a surprisingly realistic character in a novel filled with cutouts. However, I found myself repeatedly stopping to remember who was who (especially surprising since I read the book in one day). Of course the ending is implausible (along with a good portion of the plot)-- that's why we read so called 'beach novels' isn't it? To escape from reality. Despite this fact, however, the authors leave too many plot holes gaping wide open and ends untied ('unlaced' may be more to the point) for the book to be very enjoyable. But, if you're looking for a quick, uncomplicated read for a weekend getaway, 'The Beach House' surely fits the bill."

Jack Mullen, the lead character and a law student at a high- powered law firm in New York City, grew up on the lower end of this super rich community, working in his dad¿s small construction company. Ironically, he was dating Dana, the daughter of one of the biggest privately held companies in the world. The action starts at huge party at her dad¿s estate. Jack¿s brother, Peter, who coincidentally was there as a valet parking cars, was discovered dead on the beach from drowning. The police and other officials declared it as an accident, but Jack knew his brother would never swim in heavy storm surf and he hated cold water. His grandfather said, ¿Jack, they say Peter went swimming and drowned. It¿s the single biggest piece of crap I¿ve ever heard.¿ He started to really pursue his brother¿s death but because the family was a very important client of the firm, he was dismissed from his job. Jack went back home to live with his grandfather. Here he reconnected with some old high school buddies, a hair dresser, a fisherman, the county medical examiner, a land scraper, and an EMS volunteer. Together they vowed to discover the truth behind his brother¿s death. A mystery surrounded unexplained money and rumors of sexual encounters with the rich ladies of the town. Together this group dug for facts that the officials had covered up. The doctor proved that Peter had not died of drowning because the lung tissue was not consistent of drowning. He had been ¿ dumped in the water after he stopped breathing. ¿ They had a series of death threats and warnings ¿ Jack was beaten by hired thugs, Johnny was thrown over board to drown, and Doctor Jane had a terrifying middle of the night visit- before they devised a scheme to lure the killers into a vacant mansion to expose them. This is a book that shows the corruption and power that money can buy the evilness of people and loyalty of friends. The book kept me interested from beginning to end with the description of the super rich and there huge mansion all wrapped around a murder mystery."

On this particular book I only read approx 60 pages and was sooo bored that I put it down.  Characters were not enjoyable like they usually are - couldn't bear to waste my time on a book this boring.  Too many good ones to read!  

I love James Patterson and will put the blame on his co writer Peter DeJonge and will be sure not to pick up any of the books with this co author.  I would not recommend this book to anyone."

I would describe the story as mostly character driven.  If you're looking for a book with a lush and intricate fantasy world this is not it.  Barely a mention is made of the world at large outside the small boundaries of the castle.

I can't imagine reading it a second time but the first time was a pleasant experience aside from the massive quantity of grammatical errors.  No idea who is copying these books into ebook format but they need to move a little slower I think.  

""his eyes would 'bum' a baleful, hellish red.""  Sorry did you mean 'burn?'

""it would 'bum' off my hand when it went in.""  Sheesh, I guess whoever copied this to ebook format has a fetish for bums or something.

When the book was published, I recall reading a statement by King that he had written it for his daughter, who at the time was a middle schooler, because he regarded his other books as being too gory for her to read.

Bottom line, it is a classic tale of good vs. evil with richly drawn characters. I enjoyed the second time round as bit as much as I did the first time round."

I chose Art Spiegelman&rsquo;s Maus I and II. Maus is the story of the Jews and the Nazis as it pertains to the extermination of the Jewish ghettos within Nazi Germany. The book also analyzes the establishment of a protectorate government within Poland and helped me grasp the political and economic situations of the times via telling the Holocaust as though the Nazis were cats and Jews were mice. The initial situation begins with Vladek. He begins as a well-to-do young man in Poland. Vladek&rsquo;s story is Maus&rsquo;s central theme. This relates back to Spiegelman&rsquo;s description of World War II and Spiegelman&rsquo;s point of view. Vladek begins his story with a description of his affluent lifestyle before the commencement of World War II. He has just married Anja, his father-in-law has helped him set up a factory, and Vladek and Anja have a young son, Richieu. The major conflict lies within Vladek&rsquo;s fortunes change when the Germans occupy Poland. As World War II begins, Vladek is sent to fight, and ends up a prisoner of war. When he is freed, he returns to a Poland that is now occupied by Germany, and thus subject to its laws. Conditions worsen as the Germans confiscate the Jews&rsquo; property, restrict their movements, move them into ghettoes, and deport Jews to the camps. A complication lies when Vladek and his family attempt to hide from the Germans. For a while, Vladek and Anja are able to hide from the Germans in the homes of various Poles. But when they attempt to escape into Hungary, they are betrayed to the Nazis by their handlers. Terrified, Vladek and his family are sent to Auschwitz. At Auschwitz, Vladek and Anja experience the full horror and brutality of the concentration camps. Suspenseful, Vladek tries desperately to survive in the concentration camps. The ever-resourceful Vladek figures out a way to make life a tiny bit easier for himself and Anja in the camps by bartering his skilled labor and his language skills. As the war nears its end, Vladek and Anja are transferred to Dachau, where conditions are even worse than Auschwitz. In the denouement of the book, the war ends and Vladek and Anja are free. With the end of the war, Vladek and Anja reunite in their hometown, Sosnowiec. They emigrate first to Sweden, and then to the United States. Debauched accelerative to the contemporary, anywhere Art chronicles the last confrontations of Vladek&rsquo;s story. In the last scene, we return to the present as Vladek finishes his story to Art. I chose this book as it gave me more insight into the political and economic activities rather than a list of nonsensical facts in a textbook, the easy facilitations of the text, and the 
The time period and the historical events that this book references is situated is during the German invasion of Poland and the Holocaust.  The importance of these events to our historical study is the evolution of genocide and effectiveness of point of view within the recalling and analysis of Maus I and II. This book connects to what we&rsquo;ve learned in class via pertaining to the growth of the genocides and the leading and resulting of World War II.
Art Spiegelman is an American cartoonist, editor and comics advocate based in New York City, best known for his graphic novel Maus. His awards include the Pulitzer Prize Special Citations and Awards. His point of view is majorly for the Jewish and anti-Nazi propaganda as his family and cultural is culturally bonded more to Jews. He see his topic that he&rsquo;s talking about as critical and needed for support as he sees the Nazi Germans as bad and the family connection with is Polish Jewish relatives. He has these views as he heard what his relatives went through and know now what terrible people the Nazis were.    &ldquo;It would take many books, my life, and no one wants anyway to hear such stories.&rdquo; (I.1.14). This shows that Vladek is reluctant at first to participate in Art&rsquo;s project, and as the rest of the book continues, a kind of rivalry develops between them over how to tell Vladek&rsquo;s and Anja&rsquo;s story. &ldquo;But POP &ndash; It&rsquo;s great material. It makes everything more REAL &ndash; more human. I want to tell YOUR story, the way it really happened.&rdquo; (I.1.25). This shows that he was taking down his father&rsquo;s memories and recreating them on the page may not just be a concern with artistic realism, but Art&rsquo;s own attempt to connect with his father on a deeper level. 
This book gave me a deeper insight into this era of world history.  It is from the time period and this tells us about the people during the time the author was writing about political structures and cultural cosmopolitan of Europe. Political structures such as the Polish protectorate of the German lands; economic stability of Poland; and the cultural cosmopolitan of Europe.
I you recommend this book to other students as a good way to learn about this time period of the creation of the German protectorate of Poland as it pertain to knowing the political and economic conditions of the times.  What I found interesting was the use of the Nazis as cats and Jews as mice as it pertains to personified figures reflecting human history The author&rsquo;s writing style and general pace of the book was generally slow. As a graphic novel, it pertains relative to even pace."

Maas,Barnes and Noble,4.4,malydon on LibraryThing,"Interest/Reading Level:  Grades 7 - AdultSynopsis:  This book is a sequel to MAUS.  The book picks up from where the author left off with his father¿s story.  The sub-title is ¿A Survivor¿s Tale, and Here My Troubles Began.¿  Art continues his father¿s holocaust story to find out how he survived.  The book is in a cartoon format with Jews being mice, Poles are pigs, Germans are cats, and Americans are dogs.  Art¿s father, Vladek, is in ill health and his second wife, Mala, has left him to return to their Florida home.  Art and his girlfriend, Francoise, do their best to help Vladek through his health issues and to get his story written down.  Art tapes his father¿s story and later turns it into the graphic novel.  Art learns how Vladek and his mother, Anja, survived during the time they were held in the concentration camps. Vladek and Anja try to escape from Poland to Hungary but are captured and sent to Auschwitz.  Thus begins their life in the concentration camps. Vladek tells his story to Art while moving down to Florida and then returning to New York with Mala. Vladek tells Art that after the liberation, life was still very difficult and reuniting with family was easier said than done.  Toward the end of Vladek telling his story, he gives Art a box of snapshots with picture of family members from Poland.  Art discovers a picture of his father in his prison clothes and says he has to have it for his book. Reflection:  Having read MAUS, I was anxious to read the next book that Art Spiegelman wrote about his father¿s story.  I was not disappointed.  Interestingly enough, the word holocaust is never used in the book.  Rather, Spiegelman uses the phrase ¿Hitler¿s Europe.¿ It is difficult to imagine what horrors Art¿s parents went through in the camps but also what followed after the liberation.  It was not trivial to return home if indeed home was still there.  The terror had a lingering affect on Anja even after immigrating to the United States.  In 1968, whatever her demons were, she killed herself at age 56.  The story is somewhat depressing as Vladek is always complaining except when he tells his Art his story of survival.  That being said, I very much enjoyed how Art tells the story with wonderful art and graphics.  Even his fly leaf biography picture is in a mouse (MAUS) character. This would be a good book to include on a World War II unit of literature along with The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, The Diary of Anne Frank, and The Summer of My German Soldier."

This book begins with Spiegelman's father, Vladek, already in the heart of Auschwitz and retells his gripping story of survival.What can be said about Maus that has not already been said? Art Spiegelman is at the height of his craft in this book. The book was rejected by many publishers at first not only for the fact that it is a graphic novel, but also because the Jewish characters are depicted as mice (The Nazi's as cats, the Americans as dogs, and so on). The motif works incredibly well in this book. The characters as animals give the story a depth as well as removing the reader from the intensity of a story centered around the cruelty of humans.Art Spiegelman's mastery of the graphic novel format is evident throughout Maus II. His panels flow beautifully from scene to scene. The pauses in the action are appreciated not only for the fact that it not only gives the reader a glimpse into the difficulty of writing a book of this magnitude in this format, but also gives them a much needed break in the story of history's greatest mass-murder.This book is so well crafted that it deserves a place in every home.

Keats was born in New York on March 11, 1916 and died May 6, 1983. Throughout his life, his mother encouraged his talent, but his father seemed only to criticize his ability. As a child, Keats was artistically gifted and became both a successful author and illustrator throughout his life. In 1943, Keats joined the United States Army, and the army trained him to design camouflage patterns. 'The Snowy Day' is a classic from 1962, and it received the Caldecott Medal for the most distinguished picture book for children in 1963. In this book, a young boy Peter wakes up one morning to discover a beautiful, white blanket of new snow that covered everything outside. Being a young child, Peter was very excited and immediately went outside to explore and play in the snow. He made fun tracks in the snow with his feet, he made a smiling snowman, and he made snow angels. He also pretended he was a mountain climber and slid all the way down it. Before going inside, Peter put some snowballs into his pocket to keep for the next day. He then went inside to his warm house, told his mother about all his adventures, and took a warm bath. Before Peter went to bed, he checked on his snowballs he had put into his pockets. When he looked, the snowballs weren¿t there anymore. They had melted! While sleeping, Peter dreamed that the sun melted all of the snow away. Did the snow really melt or was it just a dream?  This story is simple, yet delightful and the illustrations are wonderful. Keats uses gentle, engaging text which captures the essence of the child in all of us on a snowy day. In the book, Keats writes ¿He pretended to he was a mountain climber,¿ and ¿He climbed up a great big tall heaping mountain of snow ¿ and slid all the way down.¿ This quote from the book not only allows a child to imagine themselves having a great time in the snow, but it also brings out the creative side of children where they can pretend to do anything they want and be anyone that they wish to be. The reading level of this book two, and its grade level is first grade and eighth month. 'The Snowy Day' is a wonderful book for all ages, and it recaptures the excitement of how fun winter truly is.

Written in both Marian and Kirby's point of views, it gave us a better view of each character and their reaction to discovering each other and the secrets behind Kirby's adoption. I just fell in love with the entire book. I have read all of Emily's books and this one does not disappoint because it was addicting and full of emotions and love between all the characters. I read this book in one day!! Its one book that you will not be able to put down! 

The plot was great!! I loved the point of views from both Marian and Kirby because as a reader we see the past, future and what they are both up to after the adoption. Each of the characters were amazing to read about because many people can connect with Emily's writing. I even loved how she showed how Marian and Conrad met on that fateful night as well as falling in love during that great summer as well as discovering the truth of family, as well as finding pieces of yourself showing up on your doorstep. As the story went on the development of each character evolved as they got to know each other better. I really liked Conrad because he was one of those bad boys who is Marian's real true love and despite what was happening Marian did make a choice with her situation (not telling) and then meeting him in the book once Kirby sees him is the most rewarding to read about. 

Kirby is a character many can relate too because as young adults we go through the stages. Her own story is remarkable and her meeting Marian really changes her life because compared to her life at her &quot;family&quot; she never felt that she belonged and related to, but she is a smart, talented girl who would later discover who she is and where she belongs. Marian life has changed ever since meeting her daughter who she gave up for adoption and when these two women meet each other they develop a relationship and this is a different type of view compared to Emily Giffin past writing which makes this book shine!

Where We Belong is one of the best books yet!! I am a big fan of Emily Giffin, because her writing is one of the best out there for those who love romance/contemporary in fiction. I could re-read this book over and over again because its soo memorable to go back and enjoy it again! I am looking forward to many more books by this fabulous author.

1267,"To the Nines (Stephanie Plum, #9)",0747267634,Janet Evanovich,Barnes and Noble,4,diznee25,"I'm a huge fan of Emily Giffin, but she missed the mark on this one.  'Where We Belong' had no &quot;meat&quot; to the characters/story.  This simply could have been a fault of the way it was written; every chapter switching between Marian, and Kirby.  On top of that, it was written in the first person, (for each chapter), so I would forget who I was reading about.  This style worked nicely in the beginning of the book, however, by the middle it just got confusing when both characters were together.  Or maybe there was no &quot;meat&quot; simply because Giffin left it out.  I think it's a combination of both.

I felt as though the characters were robots.  Especially in situations where many of them interact together.  There could have been much more depth, interaction, and drama....but there was none of this!  Made for a very boring book.  As I turned each page, I expected it to get better.  Much to my  dismay, it never did.

Many diehard Emily Giffin fans will probably like this book by default,  but I didn't want to be bias.  As much as it pains me to write a disappointing review, I must give my honest thoughts.  I cringe to hear that there's a possibly of a sequel.  I don't think this story line is strong enough to continue."

I picked the book up and read it straight through.  Parts of the book actually creeped me out thinking about what is actually out there around us and how fragile human life really is.  Unlike some books this title reels you within the first 10 pages.  I would recommend this book to anyone who needs information on the Ebola virus or just wants a, 'different read'."

It wouldn't be a waste of time to read it, but the book might make you feel a bit unsatisfied. It wasn't too memorable, but fans should give it a read. Then go read Hardboiled Wonderland."
1269,The Hot Zone: The Terrifying True Story of the Origins of the Ebola Virus,0385495226,Richard   Preston,Barnes and Noble,3.9,GingerbreadMan on LibraryThing,"I'm pretty sure this is not REALLY Murakami's best novel. But you know how it is, sometimes a book comes along at just the right time and just...""speaks to you"" sounds so corny, but something like that. ""Sputnik Sweetheart"" pushed all the right buttons for me, right now.It is in a way a classic love triangle. K, our narrator, loves kooky, messy would-be author Sumire. She, however, just thinks he's the best friend ever (hello, my teenage years) and besides, she's pretty certain she can't fall in love anyway. Until she does, with  Miu, a 17 years older businesswoman. Who in turn thinks Sumire is great, but can't love her. Sumire starts working for Miu, stops writing and the two women go on a business trip to Europe, which transforms into a holiday in Greece. From which Miu calls K in distress. Sumire has disappeared from the face of the earth, without a single trace.Murakami again pulls off a seamless travel from realism into something very different. You hardly notice how things are beginning to tilt, and before you know it you accept a tale like the spectacular one about Miu and the Ferris wheel (which cannot be related without spoling it) as normal.But what stays with me here is manly the relationships between these people, the distinct feeling they all share that something is LACKING in human nature, that you can be just as alone in a room full of people and the fear that it might be impossible to know someone for real. K, especially, is very relateable to me, in a bittersweet way. This book, at this time in my life, filled me with melancholy and wonder. It will linger for along time."
1269,The Hot Zone: The Terrifying True Story of the Origins of the Ebola Virus,0385495226,Richard   Preston,Barnes and Noble,3.9,klarusu on LibraryThing,"This is another poignant and unique offering from Murakami.  I love his writing and the translations read well (although as to their accuracy I cannot testify, being less than fluent in Japanese!).  I certainly won't talk too much about the plot as, for me, each Murakami novel needs to be approached for the first time without preconceived ideas.  This is, on the surface, a simple tale of unrequited love.  The narrator, a male teacher, in love with his friend, a girl.  She, in turn, is in love with a sophisticated older woman she met at a wedding and continued on to work for.  As usual, Murakami's treatment of love is subtle, poignant and tasteful.This is where the book begins to depart from the norm.  With a backdrop of normality, Murakami introduces his own 'magic' storylines that depart from reality but remain very real to the reader.  It is very alien to the western mind - there is something very Japanese about it, in a similar spirit to Miyazaki's animation and completely apart from any flights of fancy I've come across in western writing.  The reader is left to put their own interpretation on the events of the novel and choose how far to take Murakami's description of events as literal.In translated novels, you are so dependent on the translator's skill to let you appreciate the flair and language of the original.  Read in translation, this book carried a depth of language and richness of evocative description, both of places and emotions.  It reads well and in an unstilted manner.  How closely this matched the sense of the original I cannot say, but I believe that anyone skilled enough to translate something that reads so well in English will have been true to the author's original words.I would certainly recommend this highly and would suggest that even if you are a reader who prefers to read more literal novels, it is worth giving Murakami a try.  It might surprise you!"

If you can get past the sometimes stilted prose and repeated usage of phrases (""my stomach knotted"", ""made my head throb""), it's an entertaining, light read. The vocabulary isn't terribly interesting or challenging, though every once in a while, the author will come up with a beautiful Koontzian phrase to paint the imagery which offsets the clangers.The main character though isn't nearly as interesting as the conflicted Ivy, which can be quite distracting, and the strengths of the writing come in the confrontational scenarios between Rachel and Ivy. I'm guessing this is where Kim Harrison really got cranked up and engaged in the writing.This book was entertaining enough for me to purchase the second in the series, which I am currently reading and will review."

I enjoyed reading this book and it is necessary to read it before you continue on to the next ones. While Harrison does give brief recaps and explanations of things in later novels to catch up the new reader, it is much better to have just read them in order. What makes it not as good is simply that the characters (especially Rachel, Kisten, Jenks and Ivy) have not yet evolved into the great characters they become in later novels. Don't worry, though. Hang tight and just enjoy this series as it gets better with each book (except for one that mostly focuses on weres, but that's a personal taste).

For a specific review of what's going on in this novel: SPOILER ALERT! Several years ago, a virus carried by genetically engineered tomatoes (corny, but works with later story aspects) wipes out a large portion of the human population (and possibly the entire elf population). Since the numbers of humans are down and much less threatening, the creatures of fantasy decide to rally together and come out of hiding to live peacefully among the humans (except the demons). The hometown for this series is Cincinnati, OH, or the Inderlander (non-human) suburb known as the Hollows, where only the brave or fiscally conservative humans (land is cheaper since it's supposedly dangerous) live and play. Rachel Morgan, an earth witch, which means that she makes potions and charms that need to be invoked with her blood, rather than casting spells which draw energy from ley lines (basically power lines which connect our world with the ever-after, where demons dwell), is in a dead end job with the I.S. (inhuman version of the FBI, the human version of which is called the FIB in this series) and she wants out of the contract. The only thing is that no one gets out of their contracts alive, or so stories say. Anyway, when she tries to leave by making a leprechaun give her 3 wishes (I know, pretty cheesy, but bear with it again), her high-speed coworker Ivy, a powerful living vampire, and Rachel's backup pixy, Jenks, want in on the action for their own reasons. In her attempt to get out, Rachel comes under an I.S. death threat which she has to avoid while trying to take down the local crime-lord/ celebrated public figure Trent Kalamack, who is equally dangerous. She uses her own willpower and the help of her friends to get past all obstacles. Obviously, with 6 other books and counting in this series, Rachel makes it, but this book helps a lot with the back story for the other ones.
Also, if you're wondering what population this series caters to, I would say it is more mature than the Twilight or Harry Potter series, but much more fun and easier to follow than Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles."

1274,The Night Before Christmas,0399231900,"Clement C. Moore, Jan Brett",Barnes and Noble,4.3,DRayne,"If you have not yet finished the book, don't read this review!

Like most Outlander fans, I was hotly anticipating this book, but upon finishing it, I felt like I had been led on a lengthy preview of a ""real"" story still out there waiting. This book entwines several different concurrent story lines, yet resolves NONE OF THEM.  The book has no conclusion.   
All of the books are lengthy, but the first four in the series kept the reader completely engrossed because the actions were fast-paced with a series of mini-climaxes and revelations scattered throughout them, rather than following the traditional you-find-everything-out-at-the-end format. Now, the length is the result of too much useless detail rather than action resulting in too little development following a story twist. Once the story gets interesting, the reader is either disappointed by the extremes of an overly obvious or equally incredulous resolution or none at all. The style that made Gabaldon stand out from her peers has been lost.
Gabaldon's stories have always been somewhat realistic in their unfolding even if unrealistic in their premise. This is why her books have been so popular.  In the past, we have seen how difficult it is for Jamie to grasp 20th century concepts, yet Wm. Buccleigh MacKenzie supposedly comes to the 20th century and is not at all concerned with cars, electricity, etc. and is not inclined to fight with anyone he encounters in the future?  Claire loses Jamie and in less than a month sleeps with Lord John, yet in Dragonfly, she doesn't sleep with Frank until well after Brianna's birth?  And speaking of frank -- she just blurts out ""I know these things because I'm really from the future"" to Jamie's family and they're just cool with that?  My, did things come a long way in those 30 years since she was almost burned at the stake!  Additionally, the reader is to believe that Fergus' parentage is suddenly established and he's a part of the French nobility? And Amanda is somehow psychicly linked to Jem? Fans were initially drawn in by the realistic depiction of a 20th century woman trying to live in the 18th century.  It didn't take much to make the original story somewhat believable and that's what intrigued readers. Now, it is just too far-fetched to retain the original audience.   
This book also contains too many references to Lord John's activities from her other series. How many careers does one English Lord have?  Soldier, prison warden, governor, soldier again, spy . . . isn't he the jack of all trades!
Overall, I found this story to be a real letdown both in its lack of realism and its missing conclusion.  I feel that Gabaldon has moved away from her original style that made Outlander unique.  I waited on pins and needles for four years for this book.  I'm not sure if I'll bother with the next one."
1274,The Night Before Christmas,0399231900,"Clement C. Moore, Jan Brett",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"I waited 4 years for this book and am....disappointed.  Far too much of this book was devoted to Lord John.  I don't find him a sympathetic, interesting character, I just don't care about him.  

If I'd wanted to read a signficant story line involving Lord John, I would have bought one of the Lord John books.   I feel cheated so little of this book directly involved Jamie and Claire.

I suppose it's a necessity to read this book to continue on with the Outlander series, but I certainly hope the next book actually IS an Outlander book."
1274,The Night Before Christmas,0399231900,"Clement C. Moore, Jan Brett",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Booklover1962,"First of all, for those of you who think ECHO might have made more sense if you'd read the LORD JOHN novels... Actually, no, it doesn't. I read all three LORD JOHN volumes last year, and I still haven't the faintest idea what's going on in the Lord John sections of ECHO IN THE BONE.

As to the rest... This book is a meandering, aimless, cumbersome morass of contrived, sloppy, poorly motivated perils-of-Pauline plot devices and convenient coincidences. Minor characters come and go without sufficient identification; minor subplots come and go without sufficient explanation or follow-through. The characters are tedious and bland. Indeed, I found Jamie and Claire so banal and inane in this book that I cannot share other readers' regret that they only appear in about 25% of the novel; as it was, I kept winding up skimming their ridiculously pointless conversations--as well as the love scenes that came across as oddly clinical and voyeuristic throughout the book. And Claire's medical adventures were so repetitious and minutae-driven, she actually wound up making blood and pain exasperatingly dull.

The first 4/5 of the book just reads like a punishingly vast info-dump for the author's historical research. Yet while conveying a mind-numbing quantity of logistical details about the Revolutionary War, Gabaldon completely fails to convey any sense at all of the personal or political passions that led the Colonies from unrest, to rebellion, to all-out war. Until reading ECHO, it never would have occurred to me that a novel set in the American Revolution could be this dry and lifeless.

And the final 1/5 of the book reads like a panicky, rushed rough-draft that the author never went back to develop and polish. The main characters behave like wooden chess pieces being manipulated around a game-board in the author's manic attempts to shock! and surprise! the weary reader.

By the time I got to the sloppy, mid-stride, I-think-my-book-must-be-missing-some-pages ""cliffhanger"" stopping point of the book (it cannot reasonably called an ""ending"")... I realized I don't CARE what happens next. I waded all the way through this train-wreck of a novel thinking that surely it would start getting better; but it never did. 

The author totally jumped the shark with this book, and I'm through with this series now."

1275,"An Echo in the Bone (Outlander, #7)",0752898477,Diana Gabaldon,Barnes and Noble,4.4,kittydanza,"UNEARTHLY, by Cynthia Hand, is a phenomenal story with a creative approach to angels. I started this book and could not put it down. Hand weaved a mesmerizing tale coupled with an epic romance that left me wanting more!

There are not enough words to describe how much I loved this book. Each page sucked me into this story deeper and deeper until I could not stop reading until the end. I loved the idea of a 'purpose' for Clara and other angel-bloods. The history of the angel-bloods was very intricate and I anticipated gaining more knowledge as the book went on. 

Although Christian was Clara's main focus, I always enjoy a hate turned to love relationship which she shared with Tucker. Tucker was not the most popular guy in school but he sure was perfect to me. Handsome, charming, and so sweet! I wanted to jump into the book and steal him for myself. And the tension! I have to say Hand definitely has a talent for heightening romantic tension. 

There are a ton of questions that I had by the end of this book that are still unanswered. The ending was nothing like I expected and I am anxious to see how Clara deals with several revelations that occurred. Hand wrapped it up just enough to keep me satisfied, but I anticipate the sequel to get the rest of my questions answered."
1275,"An Echo in the Bone (Outlander, #7)",0752898477,Diana Gabaldon,Barnes and Noble,4.4,shmy,"Unearthly is about the decision of Clara a quarter angel between love and destiny, and if that is not enough there's she also has to decide at some point between two boys: Christian and Tucker. Tucker being the boy that teases her and calls her ""Carrots,"" but that also makes her feel normal. And Christian, being the boy that is part of her purpose and destiny, and also the picture perfect kind of boy. I found myself rooting more for the couple than for Clara's purpose. So, I'd safely say I became invested in a couple and I picked I side in the triangle between Tucker and Christian.


I really enjoyed Clara's point of vie, she's funny, and honest about her feelings even when she's jealous.  Clara's relationship with her mother Maggie is what I liked the most in this book. Parents in YA are virtually non-existent and it always turns into a double life for the main character. Not in Unearthly, Maggie is a actually a half angel and she tries her best to guide her children throughout the ""finding your purpose"" process. Of course I have the feeling she's not being entirely honest about everything she knows by the end of the book, I felt the same way about Angela, another half angel in this book and Clara's friend. I have to say I found the lack of Jeffrey, Clara's brother, disturbing, he's also a quarter angel and he should be experiencing the same confusion Clara is and yet we rarely get too see what's going on with him. Until the last part of the book when we see Jeffrey has his own tale to tell. There were many questions floating in my mind when I finished this book, what's Maggie's secret? Sam's secret? What happen to Jeffrey and the color of his wings? Does Angela have an agenda? I really think so.

I wished the author had not been so specific about things or name dropping things like Map Quest and  Barnes and Noble among other things. I fear these come with an expiration date. What will happen if Barnes and Noble merges with Borders and someone picks up Unearthly after that? Mmm, I do wonder. The pacing in this book is fantastic, I found it really hard to put down and that hadn't happen to me in a while. I laughed, I almost-cried (believe that's compliment enough), and I kept on reading.


Would I read the next book in the series? Absolutely, actually the first thing I did after finishing was look up if there was going to be a sequel. And lucky for me, its going to be a trilogy."
1276,"Unearthly (Unearthly, #1)",0061996165,Cynthia Hand,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"Strobel does a good job of presenting the case for Christ. By interviewing various scholars ('expert witnesses'), he builds that case in the same way he would build a legal case to take to court. He anticipates each objection, each piece of countering evidence, that the opposing side might introduce, and he deals with these one by one. So far, so good.    What's missing is the opposition's actual presence and participation. Since it's not Strobel's business as 'Christ's attorney' to make the other side's case - only to counter it - I suppose I'm not being fair, in one sense. Yet as a reader, and as a practicing Christian who lives in the real world every day, I was disappointed nevertheless. A one-sided debate is far less useful (and far less convincing, really) than a debate that engages both sides of the question."

1279,Hoot,0440421705,Carl Hiaasen,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"This Dover Edition of -The Aeneid- by Publius Vergilius Maro (Virgil or Vergil) is  a 1995 reprint of the English verse trans  lation by Charles J. Billson, published  in London in 1906. To try to render, or match, Virgil's Latin verse, into an English  verse 'equivalent' is a tough job indeed.  Though, there ARE several English verse translations available in paperback format.  As one reviewer already noted, there are no  notes or annotations for this 'thrift edition.'  This poses problems for those who  lack knowledge of Roman history, knowledge  of Virgil and his times, and Roman/Greek  mythology.  On the other hand, it can be a  refreshing 'break' for those who want to simply enjoy the work itself (though not in  its original language and verse format) in a  readable, if somewhat stilted English verse  form.  The original Latin (from the Loeb  Classical Library, Vol. 63) begins:  'Arma virumque cano, Troiae qui primus ab oris/ Italiam fato profugus Lavinaque venit/  litora--' [the prose translation by H.R.  Fairclough (Revised by G.P. Goold) renders  this as: 'Arms and the man I sing, who first  from the coasts of Troy, exiled by fate, came  to Italy and Lavine shores--'.]   This English verse translation by Billson  presents this same opening as:  'Arms and the Man I sing, who first from Troy,/A Doom-led exile, on Lavinian shores/  Reached Italy; long tossed on sea and land/  By Heaven's rude arm--'.  This particular verse rendering, I believe,  rates 4 stars, while the epic itself rates  5 stars as one of the world's great works  of creative art and literature. The poem   also became the ancient Roman empire's national epic (celebrating Rome's legendary  ancient ancestors and her 'destined' purpose) from the time of the 1st Emperor Augustus onward."
1279,Hoot,0440421705,Carl Hiaasen,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"I didn't quite understand this when I read it at 10 years old, but then I read it again at 14, and since then I've asked all of my friends to read it.  Now I'm reading this great adventure to my kids, and they love every sentence.  Read this, and the Odyssey."
1280,The Aeneid,0679729526,"Virgil, Robert Fitzgerald",Barnes and Noble,3.6,Anonymous,"Author Junot Diaz has crafted a wonderful, intensely entertaining story about Yunior, a young Dominican immigrant who previously appeared as a side character in his Pulitzer Prize winning novel &quot;The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao&quot;. In this book Yunior is the central figure, occupying a place in nearly all of the nine tales within. The main theme of the stories involves his search for love. Like with most of us, the search contains a myriad of ups and downs.

Yunior grew up in the macho, Dominican world of his male role models, namely his father and brother. While learning from their ways with women, Yunior finds himself interested in other, less macho pursuits, such as comic books and science fiction. The book jumps from his first days in the U.S. as a young boy (learning to speak English from TV) to his teen years and through adulthood. Diaz's writing is infused with pop culture references (most of which I got), Spanish slang (some of which I got), and Dominican references. The tales run the gamut from funny to sad to uplifting. The chapter about the death of his older brother from cancer was particularly affecting and stayed with me. Overall, it's a fascinating pastiche of stories, all with the central theme of love, romance, and even sex.

Diaz has crafted a tale worthy of the many comparisons to author Phillip Roth. His stories all intertwine together with a familiar voice, to make a read worthy of a Pulitzer Prize winning novelist. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in the complexities of how the male psyche deals with love, culture, and finding oneself.

If you enjoy this book, I highly recommend that you read Anthony Youn's &quot;In Stitches.&quot; This immensely entertaining memoir follows the author, an Asian American, as he struggles with many of the same poignant relationship issues as Yunior, except with a completely different set of surroundings and upbringing. While reading Diaz's book, I was reminded many times of Youn's story, and the fact that our longing for love is universal, no matter our race, ethnicity, or personality. Youn's is a coming-of-age story that made me laugh, cry, and just overall feel. Isn't that what we all look for in a story, and, I suppose, life in general?"
1280,The Aeneid,0679729526,"Virgil, Robert Fitzgerald",Barnes and Noble,3.6,Anonymous,"I bought this book for a long plane ride. I love Junot Diaz, really. Like a Junot Diaz/Aaron McGruder slashfic? done. But this book just felt like there was no point. It tapered off at the end and then it was just done. It was certainly a page-turner and I enjoyed it for the duration of the trip, but I felt like it was lacking in completion somehow. 

For anyone contemplating this book and are wary of the reviewers who complained about the ""over-use"" of Dominican slang, check your white privilege at the door, please. POCs aren't writing to serve you. So, the use of Spanish is NOT particularly harmful, just as his highbrow lit references aren't meant to be alienating (I almost choked on airplane wine when I read the ""she Bartlebys me"" line) and even if you happen to be white, you won't feel like POCs are out having a great time without you. Unless you're just like that anyway.

Really enjoyed reading this book, but I wish Diaz had delved more into intellectual discussions of his--sorry--YUNIOR's relationships. Entertaining, but I wouldn't read it again."
1280,The Aeneid,0679729526,"Virgil, Robert Fitzgerald",Barnes and Noble,3.6,goodgirlheroineaddict,"I bought this book because of the reviews and the catchy title.  I didn't know the author. However, after reading This Is How You Lose Her, I will look for more books by this author.

In a nutshell, this is an autobiography of a Dominican immigrant. It is a rags to riches, dirt poor to Ivy League professor story.  Diaz tells you every sad, embarrassing detail which endears him to the reader. You follow him from elementary age immigration to the loss of his older brother - a strong influencing character - to leukemia during high school. Early disconnect from both his father, who left the family for another woman, and his brother hint at rationale for Diaz's emotional distance in future relationships. We watch him struggle to become a responsible man with no positive role models and discover quite the womanizer.  The title of the book should tell you all you need to know about the results of his behaviors. He loses, over the course of his adult life several women he truly respected, possibly loved, and is left to ponder his own behavior."

I had randomly picked up this book and was completely blown away by it.  In a Mrs. Dalloway fashion, Murakami follows individual characters from sunset to sunrise.  He blends the realistic and imaginitive worlds of these individuals to create a great novel.  It is one of the best books I have ever read."
1281,This Is How You Lose Her,1594487367,Junot D??az,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"When I read the first few pages of this book, I was a bit confused but curious at the same time. The strange connection that each characters have with each other is one of the many things I love about Murakami's books. But unlike his other works, the story for this one is simple and yet reaches deep at the same time. I like the plotline 'what-happens-after-dark' and his creative imagination with creating a different world that took place between midnight and sunrise (almost like a light and darkness contrast).It is a definite page-turner, and had a strange but satisfying ending to it. Murakami's a definitive genius!"

His odd slant on contemporary culture--both Japanese and American, or maybe really world culture--is fascinating, unsettling and strangling satisfying.It begins with an encounter in Denny¿s (Murakami is fascinated with American pop culture) between two college students, a girl who¿s quietly reading in order to avoid going home and a guy who¿s off to practice with the band where he plans trombone¿in a old warehouse they can use only at night. They begin talking about chicken salad¿his favorite at Denny¿s. She¿s skeptical¿chickens are abused and full of hormones; he¿s surprised at her health concerns since she¿s smoking. These two¿Mari and Takahashi--are the focus of the narrator¿s commentary at different times during the night, basically between midnight and dawn in Tokyo. We learn that Mari is studying Chinese, has a scholarship to study in China, and that her beautiful sister¿with whom she¿s been compared unfavorably all her life¿has been sleeping for weeks, apparently healthy but avoiding the world. Takahashi loves music, but has decided to concentrate seriously on his law studies so that he can get a pretty good job at a pretty good company and live in a pretty good house with a pretty good family in a¿well you get the idea. They encounter each other and talk several times during the night, getting to know one another and relating to each other with increasing authenticity.In the meantime we encounter a Chinese prostitute who¿s been raped and beaten in the Alphaville ¿love hotel¿, and the seemingly respectable computer expert (who lives in a pretty good neighborhood with a pretty good family) who¿s responsible,  and we meet those who work at Alphaville at night.It¿s a simple story really¿increasingly real people navigating an increasingly unreal world."

I've given away over 20 copies of this book to friends and family with the hope that it will touch the people I love with the same kind of grace I felt when I read it. Truly remarkable."

The strange thing is that I HAD to get through this book - because the ideas Quinn wanted to convey were so powerful.

Nothing gets me like a bad boys who's really a good guy at heart. The best of both worlds. But I loved Echo too. (And her name and what it meant to the story) She tugged at my heart strings and I was constantly rooting for her, so sympathetic to her pain. What a fabulous, well spun story. It never shied away from very dark topics, yet left me smiling more times than I can count with it's smartly placed humor. I couldn't put this book down and I can't wait to get my hands on DARE YOU TO because the supporting characters in PUSHING THE LIMITS were wonderful and I absolutely want to learn more about them."
1284,"It's Not Summer Without You (Summer, #2)",1416995552,Jenny Han,Barnes and Noble,4.6,xydrella,"I finished Reading Pushing the Limits in the wee hours of this morning, allotting me 4 precious hours of sleep, but it was so worth it! I finished this book in one sitting, unable to put it down, completely swept up in the story and all of the emotion it brought to out of me. And believe me, the box of tissues I stopped reading to retrieve were quite necessary.




Each character fit so precisely into the plot, was so relatable, that I either loved them or hated them. There was no middle ground for me, but I did change my mind about one or two of them throughout the story. I very much enjoyed how each characters place had been revealed and distinguished a bit more throughout the story, as opposed to all up front, giving me a chance to feel involved in the story line. A beautiful plot, beautifully executed.




Katie McGarry touched my heart throughout the book. She had a firm grasp on the subject matter, it was all so possible and believable. Anyone who has ever lived even a smidgen of this story would have to agree. Anyone who understands the intensity of young true love and how it can change one at the core of their being will understand and love this book"
1284,"It's Not Summer Without You (Summer, #2)",1416995552,Jenny Han,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Falln2books,"Pushing the Limits is a beautiful story of love, loss, and forgiveness. Told in alternating points of view, switching between first-person Noah and first-person Echo, Pushing the Limits tells the story of two broken teenagers who find strength within each other. Both Echo and Noah have their own unique, tragic, and heartbreaking stories of loss. McGarry switches from one POV to the next smoothly, and all of the characters are well-developed. There is just enough suspense and mystery to keep the book interesting, but not so much that it overwhelms the romance between Noah and Echo. This is truly a story for everyone. 

I think that almost everyone has been picked on in high school. Because of that, Echo is easy to relate to. You can't help but feel bad for her. She used to have it all, then after something horrible happened to her, she lost everything. Her desire for normalcy annoyed me, but that is only because I know (now that I'm an old woman of 30) that normal is overrated and doesn't actually exist. It seems to be one of those things that most people strive for, but no one can achieve. However, she's a likable character, and she grows so much over the course of the novel. I really enjoyed watching her come to terms with her past and figure out her future. 

Noah is a bit frustrating, too, but also likable. He's definitely a flawed hero. He's extremely emotionally damaged from the death of his parents and loss of his brothers to the foster system. He's in the system, too, and has had awful luck with foster parents. Because of this, he tends to lash out at people and be a jerk for no reason. He, also, wanted to get his version of normal and wanted to rebuild his family. I wanted to shake him at times and tell him that you can't go back in time. He grows as much as Echo does throughout the novel, and I also enjoyed watching him come to terms with everything. 

The plot itself is beautiful, and the romance is sweet. The way Noah and Echo supported each other and never judged one another is touching. The story line is intriguing. Echo lost her memory of the night she received her scars, and throughout the book she remembers more and more from that fateful day. Because of that, I was engaged throughout the novel, putting the pieces together, right along with Echo. Everyone in her family, and her counselor, knew what happened, but they wouldn't tell her. She'd tried to remember once before, and she had a mental breakdown. It was extremely suspenseful every time she remembered something. It was almost as if I felt her worry of another mental breakdown, right along with her. While this is going on, we also get to witness Noah trying to put his life back together, even though he was labeled as ""emotionally unstable"" by the foster system after he hit his first foster father. I enjoyed learning his reasoning behind his actions and watching him try to be the person he wants to be. The pacing for the story was perfect, and the ending ties everything up wonderfully. 

Warnings: Drug use, underage drinking, obscenities, and a sex scene (though it's barely skimmed over. Nothing smutty or trashy, and no detail) do occur  in the novel, so this book may be best for 14+. The drug use isn't glamorized, though. I appreciated that. 

Overall, I'd recommend Pushing the Limits to almost anyone. If you enjoy good contemporary romances that have characters who are trying to overcome extreme obstacles, then this book is definitely for you."

This book is a masterpiece. Stephen King does such a great job relating the characters with the reader. Whenever a likable character or friend to Garraty (protagonist) dies, you feel as if you have lost a good friend. King's creativness is really hit home in this book. From the very beginning, you do not want to stop reading because you want to know many answers. Throughout the book, King reveals those answers and sometimes they're a bit shocking. The end is great. This book is wonderful and any Stephen King fan will love it. The only flaw with the book is the language. You cannot read a page without curse words. This isn't too big of a deal and doesn't take away from the book. If you are looking for a thrilling and exciting read, this is the one."
1287,"Miss Nelson Is Missing! (Miss Nelson, #1)",0395401461,"Harry Allard, James  Marshall",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"The Long walk by Stephen King, is a disturbing report of a contest, in which the losers pay with their lives.  The Long Walk consists of one hundred walkers. Only the elite of those who registered, were entered into the contest.  The prize being literally anything that the winner would ever desire, plus a monetary prize of millions of dollars.   	Throughout the story the reader watches the main character develop mentally, while he watches those around him die.  Unlike most authors, King develops his characters through their experiences, as opposed to just describing them. This gives the reader a better feel of the personality of the individuals in the novel.  This kind of understanding of characters makes the story much more enjoyable.  The morbidity of this story evolves even the reader.  A new understanding of the brutality transpiring within the military is reached through the novel.    	King¿s depiction of this military sponsored escapade, showed his respect for military obedience, and lack of respect for their morals.  He shows them to be robots to the commands of the `beloved general.¿ Of course the soldiers were respected, until peers started dying.  Most people respect the authority of the military.  The military has an excess of power, and lacks the ethics to back the authority, implies King through this book.  	The only alternate novel by King that is as thought provoking as this is The Rage. It is another shorter novel, This novel is remarkably illuminating.  Never had I imagined that my life could be changed by a book. This book convinced me that my previous beliefs were wrong.  This fiction forced me to revise all of my moral beliefs, for it makes one realize all of the death and destruction going on in the world.  I would instantly reccomend this book to anyone wishing for something different, and eye opening."

All of the characters come together into one book,   but this is not noticable right away.  From both 'The Giver'   and 'Gathering Blue', things start to fall into place. While   reading both 'The Giver' and 'Gathering Blue', it was hard   to understand some consepts and some things didn't   make sense. This occured at the beginning of 'Messenger'   as well, but it incorperated all 3 books into one enjoyable   read of adventure and romance. The writing style of this   book has made me even more interested to read it   because it makes you feel like you are there, experiencing   everything on the sidelines, like a director behind the   scenes of a movie. While reading 'Messenger', it was hard   to put the book down. Before I knew it, i could have been   reading for 3 hours straight and be almost finished with   the book.

1290,"Messenger (The Giver, #3)",0385732538,Lois Lowry,Barnes and Noble,4.5,BBandReveries,"Lover Revealed is Butch and Marissa's story.  Butch is taken by the lessers very early on in the book after saving a civilian vampire.  He is tortured for information about the brotherhood, but never gives in (Go Butch!).  However, something truly evil is done to Butch before he is left for dead in the middle of nowhere.  After the brotherhood rescues him, they question his fate and allegiance.  Butch is no longer the same ""cop."" After healing from his stay with the lessers, he starts to notice some changes: his body is letting off an odd spice scent around Marissa, he is much more aggressive, he can suck lessers into himself, and his blood turns black whenever he destroys the lessers his way.  
	Marissa and Butch's relationship had so many ""aw"" moments but there was one thing that seriously annoyed me; when Butch called Marissa ""baby,"" I cringed.  I really don't know why that bothered me so much.  Other than that, everything was fine.  Butch wasn't my favorite character, even in the beginning, and this book didn't really change that for me.  Although, there were some aspects that really stood out and made me love Ms. Ward's writing even more.  
	The Black Dagger Brotherhood series is a romance book series (just look at the titles).  The characters in the series have so much depth, not often seen in adult romance novels.  With each book, Ms. Ward astounds me with the way she skillfully balances the passionate love scenes with actual plot.  In Butch's story, just like Zsadist's, the central characters grow and change through the story.  Butch starts out insecure in his place in life.  Later in the book, when Butch is telling Marissa about his past he comments, ""I've always been different from other people, not just in my family but when I was working here on the CPD force, too.  I never fit in.until I met the Brotherhood.I've been living on the fringes all my life.(325).""  As the story progresses, the Butch becomes a part of a family, a part of something he never had.  Marissa also finds herself.  Even though Butch and Marissa fought a lot in this book, I think it was appropriate.  Neither were secure with themselves.  After Havers forced independence on Marissa, she started to follow her ""Rule Number One: Right or wrong, she made the choices in her life.  No one else did (402).""  Of course, Marissa doesn't become independent overnight.  In fact, she moves in with the brotherhood.  Slowly, she begins to become her own person.  Her transition from flowing gowns and corsets to pants and turtle necks was very symbolic of her transformation from a push over, aristocrat to a fully independent woman, free of the cage her brother and the glymera had forced her in all her life.  
	Lover Revealed was definitely a huge step forward in the war between the vampires and the lessers.  What happens to Butch changes everything.  The Black Dagger Brotherhood have a whole new deadly weapon in the war.  As the Scribe Virgin said, ""Now the new era in the war begins (399).""   
While this wasn't the greatest of the Black Dagger Brotherhood books, it definitely is worth the read.  Fair Warning:  like all the BDB books, there are quite a few graphic sex scenes, violence, profanity, and of course blood and gore.

A quiet little town called Jerusalem's Lot. A writer named Ben Mears. A scary old mansion, And a vampire.
Ben returns to his hometown after 30 odd years. He remembers the mansion on the hill that overlooks the town, and thinks that it will inspire a
great story. The townspeople are quiet and keep to themselves. So when things start to go bad, no one really notices. Except for Father Callahan. He knows somethings not right and that people seem to be disappearing.
When it becomes common knowledge that someone has moved into the mansion, Ben and Father Callahan become suspicious.

All the characters were so intersting and the story is very captivating. I loved the puzzles and the mysteries that the characters had to solve. I also loved that all the names of characters and places had secret meanings hidden in them. This was definitely one of the best book I've ever read.

It had many great lessons and principles about friendship, teamwork, persistence and loyalty. It really lent itself to deeper discussions about life and values. The plot was captivating and it was easy to see yourself in the action. Consequently it was fun to ask my son what he would have done or done differently than the characters in the story. Even though the children in the book were uniquely gifted, they retained some of the common,ordinariness of all kids and so were easy to identify with. It reminded me of the Harry Potter and Series of Unfortunate Events series without the supernatural or bizarre. Despite the realism, the storyline was exciting as the kids defeat the mad genius villian bent on world domination. It's a great read and you and your kids will love it!"

My current view on religion could best be described as ""agnostic,"" and this book helped to reinforce my beliefs (and non-beliefs). Hitchens presents point after well-crafted point that the thinking individual simply cannot ignore. He tackles the ""big three"" monotheistic religions (and touches on Eastern philosophies as well) with the apt authority of one who really knows his enemy, so to speak. He understands the teachings and stories of the Bible and the Qur'an very well, and deftly and unapologetically points out the many contradictions and sensationalisms therein. If Hitchens' goal was to leave me both enlightened (by his thought-provoking insights) and infuriated (by the dumbfounding machinations of religion), then I can happily say he has achieved a roaring success."

If anything it will provide you a different point of view about the basis of your thinking. It's a calm, rational, and well thought out argument for a point of view supporting agnosticism, and atheism. He doesn't push, but the points made need to be considered which challenge your point of view. If you subscribe to a faith, it will give you pause to reflect on how you rationalize your point of view with his. You need to approach the book for what it is; a well presented, rational but different point of view of religion(s), and belief in a ""supreme being"" regardless of which religion you subscribe (actively or not).

Trying to tackle his rational approach with platitudes, and edicts from your religion, is a waste of your money and time. He's not trying to get you to ""convert"" to anything; just a scholarly presentation of a point of view that isn't mainstream, but does reflect faith based actions of individuals, groups, and current religions.
If you're not, it is a different way of thinking, with many rational points of view presented, that are difficult to refute.
Personally, I share his point of view, but was never able to crystalize it as succinctly and with the background research he provides to move this point of view forward.
Religion has always been a practice of mysticism.
It was an enjoyable read."

I waited for months for the release of this book and I was left so disappointed! I agree with the reviews below. I felt like Rush's actions DID NOT support the things he told Blaire. I found it odd that his pregnant fiance had no car, little money and was working at the country club considering his financial status. I was waiting for him to pull a Christian Grey and try to take care of her but aside from buying her a bed, complaining about her bra being too small and cutting a check to Woods for her her rent, he never did. I was rooting for her to give Woods a shot in this book. Of the two of them, he was the one offering support. I also felt like there were no real twists or surprises. We spent the entire length of the book going back and forth between Blaire and Rush on whether they could make their relationship work and nothing really happened. And the ending.... wow! I was waiting for the book to kick into gear and it just ended!"

Rush is constantly giving overblown speeches about how much he loves Blaire but fails to show this in his behavior...other than sex.  Now I am HUGE fan of sex but real love doesn't manifest itself in the physical only.  In real life, kiddos, it really is the little stuff that counts.  Like remembering the dr. appt to see your baby for the first time.  Like NOT screaming at the mother of your child to get out of your car and leaving her alone. Nan is his sister not is child.  I tried to like Rush but I just couldn't.  Blaire pays a lot lip service to being strong and independent but fails miserably to demonstrate either quality."

1296,State of Fear,0061015733,Michael Crichton,Barnes and Noble,4.4,precious_seraph,"I¿ll start by saying this quote from Sea by Heidi Kling: I wanted to tell him that you can meet someone and they can change your life forever, even if you have only known him for a short while¿

That quote was exactly what was manifested in The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight. But when Hadley met Oliver, she wasn¿t really thinking about that. She was thinking that it was all because of the flight. Midair, people meet people, share stories with them and maybe even share a few secrets with them. But upon landing, they just wave goodbye and walk away forever. Somehow, that was what happened to Hadley and Oliver. They met at the airport, left the airport and went their separate ways. It should¿ve stayed that way for them, like for most people, but in 24 hours time, they managed to develop a connection that was sudden, startling and life-changing.

Hadley went to the airport with annoyance, dread and unwillingness building up inside of her. Her father was going to get married to a British woman she¿s never even met, the same British woman that caused her parents¿ divorce. She was one of the bridesmaids. I love Hadley¿s character. She was honest but considerate and unsure in so many ways but determined. She seemed so real. This girl could be me if I were in that position. For this, it was very easy to like her and to feel for her.

Oliver was an English gentleman. Tall, lanky, handsome with good humor, he was absolutely adorable. Throughout the time he spent with Hadley while waiting for their flight and during the flight, he was pleasing, entertaining and amusing. He was the kind of guy that makes a good impression and that is hard to forget. But I could sense that there was something dark about him, like something was weighing down on his shoulders, occasionally making him hunched, distant and silent.

In London, Hadley went through the motions of preparing for the wedding. She met Charlotte, the British woman who captured her Dad¿s heart. There, she realized the truth about her Dad¿s new phase, the changes in her own life and Oliver. The novel was a grand mixture of musings and flashbacks that brought me closer and closer to Hadley. The flashbacks were vivid and painted with emotion. They were honest and real from the memory of a child. It helped me in connecting the dots and seeing the bigger picture.

The writing was breathtaking. I loved it! I loved how the author transformed that most mundane thing into something beautiful and how she injected little bits of realizations about daily life into the novel. It was like looking at life through a different pair of eyes.

The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight is an extraordinary contemporary romance born from an extraordinary circumstance. The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight is brimming with humor, curiosity, love, changes and regrets that will fly readers to the world of possibility, fresh starts and second chances. I highly recommend this to readers of contemporary romance!"
1296,State of Fear,0061015733,Michael Crichton,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Nikkayme,"There are some books that are so perfectly perfect that they make the reader swoon along with them. The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight is one of those books. It&rsquo;s romantic and heartfelt and so much more than just that &ndash; focusing on more than just the romance and allowing the reader to see true love in more ways than one.

There&rsquo;s still plenty of romance. And it&rsquo;s magnificently done, invoking butterflies and blushes and longing. Brit boy Oliver is sexy (he&rsquo;s British, so obviously he&rsquo;s sexy) and intelligent and quirky and funny and absolutely adorable in his randomness. He makes Hadley&rsquo;s heart race and will do the same to the reader. Considering that a third of the book takes place in an airport/airplane, these two need to have some serious chemistry to keep the reader hooked.

On top of a romance that feels epic, there&rsquo;s the backstory to both Hadley and Oliver. Hadley&rsquo;s family dynamic is so well-crafted that I was there with her, the entire way, partially hating her father, while hoping the two of them could work everything out. The father/daughter relationship has just the right amount of angst and bitterness, then Smith throws in flashbacks of tenderness and undeniable love.

Hadley is everything readers could want her to be. She&rsquo;s young and angry at her father, angry at her mother, but vulnerable and not jaded enough to have a complete disbelief in love. This book had me smiling from that very first page. Jennifer E. Smith knows how to write characters that the reader will feel an instant attachment to, and give us a story that is impossible to put down.

The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight will sway even the most reluctant romantics with its delightful humor, heartfelt characters, and the idea that maybe love at first sight is possible. Smith&rsquo;s collection of fate, coincidence, and love made me smile, it made me laugh, and it even made me tear up &ndash; it&rsquo;s that good. As far as contemporary YA goes, The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight is one of the best and a definite must read."

1297,The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight,0316122386,Jennifer E. Smith,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"This is the second in the series and I must say that I loved it even more than the original. I like how you got to know more about Kitty and Nathaniel. No wonder Jonathan Stroud said I think in an interview or something that he had fun writing it. It was fun to read and I couldn't help but read the next chapter not realizing what the time was afterwards. That's how good it is. It has action, adventure, suspense, and little romance. Nat sort of still gets on my nerves at times but still love Bartimaeus. Read it after you've read the first of course. There are three stories concerning Kitty (I liked hers better than Nat's to be honest), Nat and Bartimaeus (anything with him in it is awesome either way). Check this series out when you get a chance. Jonathan Stroud is now one of my fave writers."

Once again, he uses just the right amount of wittiness, adventure, and suspense inorder to create an amazing, complex tale. The author weaves a truly wonderful story by providing background information on the golems, and then building off of that provided background so that everything is tied up with each other, leaving no loose ends and creating a truly statisfying book."
1297,The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight,0316122386,Jennifer E. Smith,Barnes and Noble,4.4,carlosmock,"The Golems's Eye by Jonathan Stroud- Book Two of the Bartimaeus Trilogy

The second book starts where the first one ended.  Nathaniel-now officially John Mandrake-after the demise of his incompetent master is now assigned to be the apprentice of the powerful Security Minister, Ms. Jessica Whitwell, and is promoted to be the youngest Assistant to the Head of Internals affairs, Mr., Julius Tallow, who inherited his old master's job.  

At only 14, Nathaniel is a rising star: a young magician who is rapidly climbing the ranks of the government.  He's a bright future until he is asked to deal with the growing Resistant movement, which is disrupting magicians' lives with thefts and raids.

No easy task, The ringleaders: Katherine Jones (Kitty), Frederick Weaver (Fred), and Stanly Hake (Stan), have a special talent: they are resilient to magic and under the guidance of Mr. T. E Pennyfeather, they are about to commit their greatest theft of all: rob the tomb pf the greatest magician who ever lived: Mr. Gladstone.

As the pressure mounts, a new series of terrifying attacks are occurring in London.  First attributed to the resistant, Nathaniel has no choice but to break his promise to Bartimaeus, the djinni who helped save the government in the first book.  Bartimaeus discovers that the new destruction is being caused by a Golem-not seen since 1868 in the war with Prague.  Nathaniel must make a desperate journey to the enemy city of Prague and uncover who's the traitor behind the summation of the Golem and at the same time deal with the Resistance.

A thrilling sequel to the Amulet of Samarkan, The Golem's eye is a roller coaster ride of magic, adventure, and political skullduggery in which lessons and change of attitudes occur as the fates of Kitty, Bartimaeus, and Nathaniel explosively collide.

This is a wonderful read, definitively highly recommended!!!"
1298,"The Golem's Eye (Bartimaeus, #2)",0786836547,Jonathan Stroud,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Modern_Day_Philosopher,"""Sharks are the criminals of the sea. Dolphins are the outlaws."" Most people view outlaws as outlandish and destructive people, but only few have been able to phonetically explain what depth and ""laws"" an outlaw must live by. In the story Still Life with a Woodpecker written by Tom Robbins, he is remarkable in his ability to make such deep ideas come out at a humorous level and yet still be thought of in a serious way. The story involves two abstract and opposite people who meet, love, and hate each other in a mere 3 pages. The characters, romance, and morals to this novel make it a classic.
The main character is a woman named Leigh-Cheri, but she is no ordinary actually she is a princess living hidden in the United States. She strictly believes in peace amongst everything, and just wants no one to feel any harm. She lived in solitude for a while due to her miscarriage as a cheerleader at a football game, and in her embarrassment dropped out of school. Now the second character is known as the Woodpecker. He loves dynamite and feels that everything can be fixed if dynamite is used correctly. He lives outside the law, and feels that it is his duty to go against the government for government to exist. He is a very intellectual individual and strange man. He is quoted saying, ""The lung of the smoker is a naked virgin thrown as a sacrifice into the god fire"", which just shows his abstract views on things.
I have never really been a fan of romance novels, but the romance in this is very different and deeper than most love we see in movies and shows. The Woodpecker and Princess meet at a peace fest in Hawaii under strange circumstances. He was trying to blow up part of the fest, but placed the dynamite in the wrong location. After she places him under citizen's arrest he woos her without even trying. It is very humorous how they both have very strong beliefs in different things and yet love overcame them.
Although most themes within the story were underlying ones they were still apparent in the novel. For example, ""Funny how we think of romance as always involving two, when the romance of solitude can be ever so much more delicious and intense"" this was said by the Woodpecker when he had lost someone he loved. It really shows that a person can live without a partner as long as they love themselves. Also he talks about how outlaws are actually a necessity to society, but somehow not part of society. This really shows how our world is today if you think about it.
In Conclusion, Still Life with a Woodpecker is a great read for anyone who loves an easy read with a deep story and an occasional laugh. I would highly recommend it."

As an avid Robbins fan, I can confidentally say that 'Still Life' is my favorite book of his- if not my favorite book that I've ever had the pleasure of reading.

It flips back and forth from the present to the past with the mother's life, and with her daughter's life.  Each time it switched, I didn't want to leave one's life for the next, but was quickly drawn to the 'new' story.

The reader should be warned that the editing in this book was horrible.  First, there are no quotation marks, making the dialogue confusing at times.  Many sentences don't begin with a capital letter, the word ""I"" is sometimes written with a lower case letter, spelling errors are frequent, and one of the protagonist's name even is misspelled in some chapters."
1299,Still Life with Woodpecker,184243022X,Tom Robbins,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"I just started reading this novel and so far the story is really interesting, however there is one thing missing - quotation marks!!!

I'm surprised no one has yet to mention it, but I have to say it is really distracting to have to read dialogue without quotation marks to differentiate between what is said and what is thought. 

I know the new trend for new authors is to forego conventional writing styles for a more free-form approach, but it loses it's effect here - I find myself distracted by the lack of quotation marks (I want to fill them in by hand!) instead of focusing on what promises to be a great story. 

Editors at Harcourt: please put them back in for the next edition! My 8th grade English teacher would have a heart attack if she read this novel!"
1300,Those Who Save Us,0156031663,Jenna Blum,Barnes and Noble,3.4,Guest,"While I still call myself a Grisham fan - especially with the goofy cartoon characters that appear in his prose - this book didn't work for me for two reasons:  1- Too much time and energy is spent on the Italy experience. It came across as an Italian travel commercial.  2- Like 'The Brethren', since there was no real protagonist to root for, by the end I didn't care a flying fig how the story came out. I didn't feel the slightest bit of empathy for Joel. Teddy was a sadistic piece of work. Luigi was too cardboard to be of any help. The one engaging relationship - the love interest - was drawn far too subtly for my liking. C'mon - the guy was in prison for six years... would you want to look at porticos for two hundred pages?  Extremely disappointing. Terribly."

1301,The Broker,0385340540,John Grisham,Barnes and Noble,4.1,NatalieTahoe,"WOW! I think this word over and over again throughout the reading of Across the Universe, by Beth Revis. A Young Adult novel, it is literally a murder mystery in space, in a universe that stretches on and on, infinite and vast. And how incredibly lonely it is when stuck on a ship traveling in it. Amy is sixteen and lives with her parents on Earth. Her parents are gifted and essential to a world that other gifted members of society are selected to make a journey to. These people will be cryogenically frozen to journey 300 years to this new world to help begin life on that planet. But, Amy is not essential to this new planet. She's a kid, but is permitted to go because of her parents, and is frozen into the 300 year sleep along with her parents on the ship called Godspeed. Fifty years before the intended arrival to this new world, Amy awakes when she is unplugged and separated from her cryo-haven, surviving an attempted murder -- and no one knows who did it. Forced with the reality that she is now living in a small city that exists on the metal ship, where everyone awakens to a fake sun and drinks recycled water, Amy bonds with Elder, also sixteen. This new life is all that she will now have and she is also awake before her parents. She's now alone. Elder is next in line to lead the ship after the current aging leader, known as Eldest, passes on. But, now amidst the safety of a world which doesn't know questions and chaos, someone is starting to kill again, and they're targeting the frozen people hidden in a ship that only a few select people know about. The release date for this book is January 2011, and color me giddy with excitement for how this book will be received by everyone. It has all of the elements that all murder mysteries need, which completely satiated my desire for a good ""whodunit,"" all amidst the realities of space and the cage of Godspeed. I could not put the book down, and my eyes were growing heavy with sleep late into the night as I kept telling myself ""just one more page."" Each chapter switches between Amy's and Elder's perspective, allowing you to experience each of their own stories. Normally, I tend to like one character more than another when chapters switch like that and want to hurry to get to the next chapter, but not with this one. As each chapter switched characters, I was excited, ready to find out more and uncover the mystery that each of them were facing. I cannot tell you more about the plot without giving anything away - I can only tell you that I loved this book, this story with characters so real and interesting and engaging. I was drawn into their angst, their confusions, and the mystery that they were trying to solve. There is even more to this story, discussions of class systems, prejudice, and other social issues that were fascinating. I admit that I sit on the edge of my seat wishing for 2011 to pass quickly so that I can get my hands all over Book Two -- oh, yes, this is a series! Yes, yes, yes!"
1301,The Broker,0385340540,John Grisham,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Mosstralia,"Reading Across the Universe is like watching a bad carwreck, you know it's sad but you just can't look away. Among the spaceship's  1,000 + inhabitants are 100 people who have been cryogenically frozen - specialists in the fields of science and military and their family members from earth who will help to start the new planet once they land. But there are problems. Lots of them. Someone has been trying to kill off select frozen people by unplugging their power source and thus making them drown to death, through centuries of breeding incest is rampant on the spaceship and everyone looks the same, the spaceship is being ruled by a Hitler-like dictator who lies and drugs the passengers in order to keep them obedient, history books about earth have been changed to show Kim Jong IL and Hitler as heroes and peacemakers as evil and the one unfrozen victim who was rescued is the only one who can see all the problems and knows the truth but no one believes her. The book was great in a depressing way. I kept wanting to read and find out what else was a lie about the spaceship, some of the secrets were easy to figure out, others were complete shockers. The last chapter ended on a positive note, however this is a series so look forward to the next depressing 79 chapters soon!"
1301,The Broker,0385340540,John Grisham,Barnes and Noble,4.1,ChelseaW,"As Amy's father prepares to be cryogenically frozen, he offers her a chance to opt-out and continue living her life as normal on Earth. She chooses to be frozen herself, and follow her parents aboard the Godspeed, to be woken up 300 years in the future on another planet. When she is thawed out, it is extremely painful and 50 years too soon. She quickly makes a friend in Elder, a boy roughly the same age as she is and second in command on the ship. But Amy is from Earth, and her different appearance and behavior does not fit into society on the ship at all. Before long, sinister acts begin happening around Amy, turning allies into suspects. With lies being revealed and secrets being overturned, Amy and Elder hold on whatever truths they hold in themselves.

Across the Universe is breathtaking science fiction, the kind where I feverishly turn the pages to find out what happens next. One of those books where immediately after the last page is turned, I want to start over from the beginning and read it again. It really is that good. I was hooked right from the start, with the detailed process of being frozen. I am usually pretty squeamish but I could not stop reading. I felt every inch of Amy's claustrophobia and every ounce of Elder's frustration. The futuristic swearing is reminiscent of Battlestar Galactica and works well with Elder's character. Revis goes to great lengths in order to let the reader discover what is what in the world she has created. There are no lengthy passages of exposition. Some aspects are very cool (grav tubes) and others are a little far-fretched (mono ethnicity), but overall the concepts are deeply thought out and well executed. Fans of Maria V. Snyder's Inside Out and Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games will love this book. I eagerly look forward to more from this author!"

Dresden is one of the more interesting characters ever devised in this genre (Gandalf meets Sam Spade with a huge dose of wise-ass) and James Marsters was the perfect choice as a reader for the series (as good, for example, as Patrick Tull was for the Patrick O'Brien Aubrey-Maturin novels).  Although I've enjoyed all of the Dresden Files books immensely, this episode is among my favorite.  Why?  Well, it brings us Mouse, explains the Thomas-Harry relationship, gives us a glimpse into the Murphy family, and reveals what a cold monster Papa Wraith really is."

1306,The Silent Wife,0143123238,A.S.A. Harrison,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Anonymous,"This is a terrific, provocative and thought provoking book on feminisim and all things, ""woman,"" in general; however, it is not for everyone's tastes.

***If you are easily offended by four letter words on a broad, or body-specific basis--you'll probably want to stay away. Moran is an intelligent, articulate writer, but she gleefully embraces her vulgarities, even defending her use of one particularly offensive word.  While the language can be blunt, it simply comes across as being HER, her personality and her view of womanhood;  for me, it did not come across as a blatant attempt to be shocking--it's just who she is, her experience. I found it alternately appropriate, funny and question-raising; I had no problem with it--but some readers might.

***As Moran is English, based in London and the book was originally published there--there are many references to British personalities, pop culture and every day life that some readers will not be familiar with.  If it's bothersome, be prepared to do some Googling.

***A feminist-treatise, this is also a memoir;  Moran is ""no holds barred"" on her personal revelations. At times, this reads as ""TMI"" with raw, humiliating, cringe-worthy recounts of her coming of age: as one of 8 kids she relates, with brutal honesty, the traumas of being welfare-poor to the point her hand-me-downs included her mother's old underpants and the stifling lack of privacy. 

***Her sister, Caz, emerges as a prize scene-stealing supporting character--some of the best lines are from her 

***Moran is a wickedly funny, highly intelligent writer and thinker; don't assume because this book is funny, it's not serious.  It tackles everything from body image/hair/functions, to sex, marriage, kids and abortion. It is a perfect read for discussion with your closest friends as Moran talks about these subjects in intimate ways that many of us wish we could emmulate.

I find her views refreshing and bold--and comforting: it reminds us that being a woman--struggling to come into our womanhood--is traumatic, often gross, humilating and heartbreaking.  Yet Moran reminds us we are not alone in our ""female"" struggles and ultimately, to find joy, in who and what we are.  

Not for everyone's taste, but for those who jump in--I think you will enjoy the ride--this is a worthwhile read that absolutely needs to be discussed, laughed over, and debated."
1306,The Silent Wife,0143123238,A.S.A. Harrison,Barnes and Noble,3.7,SC_Paula,"Caitlin Moran's How To Be a Woman is wildly funny and at the same time a great introduction to a modern idea of what it means to be a feminist.  To quote the author, ""a.  Do you have a vagina? and b. Do you want to be in charge of it?  If you said ""yes"" to both, then congratulations!  You're a feminist.""  Moran tackles everything from menstruation to masturbation, hair removal, underwear size, and abortion in a very honest and hilarious fashion.  As a side note, I learned about this book when Caitlin and Jenny Lawson aka The Blogess (who is also ridiculously funny and the author of Let's Pretend This Never Happened) interviewed each other."
1306,The Silent Wife,0143123238,A.S.A. Harrison,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Anonymous,"This book is an unapologetic feminist rant, wrapped in an entertaining autobiography.  It treats some very important issues with thought-provoking comments, but also is peppered with a good deal of humor.  There are some really important take-away messages that nicely summarize the situation for women and our place in society.  I really liked how she suggested that asking simple questions could help assess important problems like harassment and oppression/inequality:  ""is that polite?"" and ""are the men doing this?""

There is a lot of strong language that may be off-putting to some readers, and as the author is from the U.K. there is some usage that may be unfamiliar to US readers.  In addition, there is quite a bit of slang that may be unfamiliar to readers who are not as steeped in popular culture, but it does not interfere with the reading of the book (and can be entertaining to look up).  This is the sort of book that our daughters should read and consider, but it might be better (depending on the daughter's age) if we didn't know they were reading it!"

It was impossible to get any sleep without finishing the book first. Now, what with all the surprise, suspense, laughter, romance, and frustration I am left very emotionally drained. I want the next book NOW, and it hasnt even been two days since this one has been out.

I will admit that first book in this series was not my favorite but this book was beautifully written. I was honestly surprised at how things happened for Feyre and friends and am saddened that I have to wait so long for the next installment since I finished this one within hours! You will never be bored when reading a novel written by Maas.

Maas,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Circulartime,"As a long time Stones fan, I've seen them live in 4 different decades, 2 centuries and 2 milleniums, my biggest surprise was how accurate the unauthorised biographies are.  Staight from Keiths mouth cleared up only a few minor details in his life story.  Regardless though, I found the book very enjoyable.  I would find myself alternating between rooting for Keith and then thinking he needs to grow up.  I guess becoming an international pop star by the time he was 23 and then maintaining that status his entire adult life would tend to create a very different perspective on life.  The absolute best parts of the book for Keith fans are the glimpses into his private life with his family.  His brief account of owning and driving a Winnebago on a couple of family vacations was a bit of a shocker.  I think thats in Revelations somewhere..."

Reads like a conversation with an interesting and disarming person. Not being a musician, the musings about his guitar playing and the music itself was not of interest to me, but I'll bet anyone who plays guitar will get it. I loved the book. Insights into his life and world were fun to read, but I cannot imagine living it. The biggest thing I found was that beneath all that ""image"" thing is a rather sensitive and intelligent person, despite the fact that he was so self destructive. Worth reading."

Keith's character, rather than his music is what interested me in buying this book. This is a great read from cover to cover. I couldn't put it down.  You don't need to be a huge Stones fan to enjoy this rockin' thrill ride.  Keith's approach to life and the people around him provides a glimpse into a warmer, deeper side to the man behind the most famous rock mega-group ever. Oh, and he answers the question about whether he really snorted his father's ashes and what he was doing up in the tree on that tropical beach when he fell and injured himself. This is a great read. Buy the book!"
1309,Life,0297854399,Keith Richards,Barnes and Noble,4.2,dke,Jhumpa Lahiri has a beautiful way of drawing the reader into her characters and their stories.  I actually believed that I was reading a collection of short stories until I was half way through the book when it dawned on me that I was reading a novel.  Ms. Lahiri has a marvelous gift for surprise that keeps the reader in a  perpetual state of wanting to learn more about her characters and their lives.  Each story holds it's own on an individual basis and yet when taken collectively they make a a breathtaking collage.  I would invite anyone to appreciates the written word to pick up a copy of her book  and indulge themselves.
1309,Life,0297854399,Keith Richards,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"Call me a fan of Jhumpa Lahiri's beautiful writing.  I loved her first Pulitzer prize winning book of short stories and last winter when I was reading her novel, The Namesake, I heard that this book was even better than the Pulitzer prize winning short story collection, The Interpreter of Maladies.  It proved to be the truth.  I loved this short story collection at least as much as the first, if not more.  Reading these stories transported me to familiar, yet slightly foreign, culture where I lived for the duration of my reading experience.  Ending the last story was like finishing a sad but hopeful novel because a series of interrelated stories concluded the book. 

From my perspective, you can't go wrong with this author.  I love her writing and look forward to whatever she publishes next.  Her stories are a piece of 21st century America infused with strong cultural perspectives.  Her characters are universal yet highly culturally bound...a delight to experience."
1309,Life,0297854399,Keith Richards,Barnes and Noble,4.2,ajunatnyc,"I've read all three of her books - I think this might be her best.  I loved The Namesake, but she tries new techniques as a writer here.  And she has the power to hit you with once sentence that just kills you in the middle of a story.The third story - Only Goodness - really hit home for me.  I'm glad the Indian community has a voice like this.  And if you're not Indian, I think you might enjoy her books even more because she sheds light on a new world of Indian-American fusion.  Great great book.  I devoured it in a weekend - I think you'll do the same!"

1311,The Pilot's Wife,0316601950,Anita Shreve,Barnes and Noble,3.7,AnaMardoll,"White Noise / 978-1-440-67447-1 White Noise, arguably Delillo's best work, carefully explores a world where consumerism has, almost literally, consumed us all, to the point where we become empty shells of people. The extended family in the book have been reduced by consumerism to two-dimensional beings, dependent upon television and other cultural stimuli to tell them how to think and behave. Occasionally, they act out against this emptiness (or is it that a wire has been crossed in the brain?) with idiosyncrasies such as a pronounced preference for the smell of burnt toast, or a tendency to find frumpy jogging outfits attractive. On the weekends, they shop at the local supermarket, under the soporific thrall of the overhead neon lights. When their consumer culture literally threatens to kill them, via a toxic waste spill on the town railroad, they are ill-prepared to respond and look to their customary authorities (television and radio) on how to react to the emergency. When fire trucks storm through town, broadcasting an evacuation notice, the mother wonders absently whether the evacuation is a suggestion or a command. And in the aftermath of the toxic cloud, even when many have died and many more have had their lives shortened by exposure to the poison, the town feels no outrage, only numbness that what is normally confined to the television news stories nevertheless happened in their idyllic town. Actors themselves, they practice emergency evacuations, determined to perform better ""next time"". Despite the shallowness of their lives, they fear death. Some self-medicate with dangerous experimental drugs in an attempt to control that fear. Others take up death-defying hobbies in the hope that this will deaden their fear. They discuss which food preservatives will kill them, whether the phones lines will cause cancer, which yoga poses will prolong their lives, and how to squeeze every drop of life out of their lives. When a character points out how much energy is wasted in daily life (carrying things that don't need to be carried, making extra trips, etc.), another asks what would one do with all the saved energy. The answer: Live longer. In this way, Delillo paints a stunning and frightening portrait of a community that fears death yet has no love for life. ~ Ana Mardoll"
1311,The Pilot's Wife,0316601950,Anita Shreve,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Anonymous,"White Noise is a fantastic work of literature. Chances are you will have a different view of society after reading this. In the novel Don DeLillo examines a society where people are emotionless, completely void of any human feelings. People have been effected by consumerism to extremes.  Characters spend copious amounts of time discussing what will kill them, fearing death, trying their hardest to avoid it, yet have no appreciation for life. When a &ldquo;Airborne Toxic Event&rdquo; kills many of the citizens of the town and decreases the lives of countless others, the townspeople feel no anger whatsoever. They continue their average lives in a almost emotionally sedated state. This book does a fantastic job illustrating how on a grand scale how minor our everyday tasks are. And how we pay more attention to a minor event in our life like going to the grocery store, than a life changing one in another persons life, even someone as close as a child or close friend. Although there are many people who dislike this book, I would recommend it to anyone. It shows a interesting perspective of everyday life. Although we are not in a society centered around consumerism as shown in this novel, some of the characteristics could be applied to us, and might even change your views about certain everyday things.

However, I cannot recommend the Nook version, which I would have to give 1 star.  This is actually my first Nook book and I must say I am incredibly disappointed.  Not only is the photographic material removed, the book formatting is absolutely atrocious.  Fonts change size and type 2 or 3 times on a single page making the experience of reading the book a chore.

Not sure if other Nook books are like this, but I don't think there's an excuse for this.  Perhaps it's because I'm using the Nook app on the iPad, but even that is the latest version.

Mostly the story of a first love from beginning flirtations to a bitter end, the story also takes you through the progression of mind and memory and how we become who we are. While reading there are a range of emotions that you go through and in the end you close the book and think about your own progression and growth. From the moment I picked the book up I did not want to put it down. The pictures and text work fantastically together. I stayed up all night to finish it.

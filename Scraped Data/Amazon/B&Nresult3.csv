203,"Beautiful Disaster (Beautiful, #1)",0000000000,Jamie McGuire,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Meliss657,"I absolutely loved this book.  It's one of those books that you can't put down and when you're done reading you just keep thinking about it.
I was a little hesitant at first because the synopsis makes it sound kind of cheesy, but turns out it's not.
The characters of the book were great and each had their own personality.   
The relationship between Abby and Travis is definitely volatile at times, you can really feel what they're feeling.
All in all this book made me laugh, cry, and made me very happy I purchased it and took a chance.  I really hope Jamie McGuire comes out with more books like this or even companion books for it.  I'd be interested in reading about the other characters she had too."
203,"Beautiful Disaster (Beautiful, #1)",0000000000,Jamie McGuire,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"This. Book. Is. Amazing! I read it in one sitting and just couldn't put it down! By the time I was done, I qualified for zombie status, but oh it was so worth it. I LOVED Travis. He was tough, rambunctious, headstrong, unreasonable, confusing and immature. Not to mention a total manwhore! He was also caring, loving, protective, devoted and single minded in getting the girl! Oh and did I mention he was totally HOT! Complicated doesn't even start to describe him, but all these reasons only made me love him more! I also really liked Abby. She was a great love interest and very well written. The two together burned up the pages and left me hungry for more! I loved Shep and America together and best friends to Travis and Abby. This was an amazing story of two polar opposites who find out they aren't really that opposite, push-pull till they find they are in love and then conflict ensues! Im am enamored with this book! It was such a terrific read!!!! The only downside to this book was it didn't keep going..and going and going!"
203,"Beautiful Disaster (Beautiful, #1)",0000000000,Jamie McGuire,Barnes and Noble,4.4,ReadergirlReviews,"I found this book by just trolling the online shelves.  I wasn't sure what to expect at all, but the blurb sounded interesting, the price was good, so I went ahead and took a chance.  I am so glad that I did.  I hadn't heard of this author, or any other books by her, and I see that it appears it was self-published electronically.  Doesn't matter.  This book was a pleasant surprise and was so much more than I expected.

Yes, the blurb is cute, but there's actually a lot more to the story than is covered in the blurb.  It is a very character-driven story and there are, for most of the book, only about four or five characters really.  The story follows Abby, her friend America and her boyfriend, and of course, Travis.  Of course the real story was Abby and Travis.

I've read romances before where you have a protesting heroine who meets a sexy guy who charms everyone else and wow, wonder of wonders, she wants nothing to do with him.  It's not usually believeable, but Abby was serious about it.  And the author did a great job making her protests realistic.  Travis is sexy, interesting, and you just can't help but love him to pieces even though he's a male slut at first.  Abby is his friend.  And things go from there.  The tension between these two was absolutely perfect.

I can't really remember when I've read a more sizzling romance between two characters.  This author did a fantastic job on this story.  It was simple, sexy, and had some really good serious pieces that mixed things up just right.  I loved it.  I hope the author puts out more!!"

204,A Christmas Carol,1561797464,Charles Dickens,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"This is a great christmas read for all ages. Im 16 and i loved it. There are some typos, but nothing that would make it difficult to understand. I definately would reccomened this book to a friend!"
204,A Christmas Carol,1561797464,Charles Dickens,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"The character Ebeneezer Scrooge has to be one of Dicken's famous characters. In his novella, Dickens portrays a man disappointed with himself and who regards the world with contempt. I always thought of the visits by the three spirits as therapy. Modern pyschology hadn't evolved in the 1840s and somehow Scrooge's breakthrough comes through as a recovered patient. 
I read that Dickens was a contemporary of Karl Marx and as Marx advocated social change to improve the conditions prevalent during that time, Dickens believed that change could come about by social awareness. Laws could be legislated because society felt compassion. 
The two children Ignorance and Want, who are hidden under the cloak of the Spirit of Christmas Present were not intended only for plot of the story but as a reminder for Dickens' readers.
Are not the 21st century readers still having to think of that boy and girl today? The media presents us news of children in refugee camps,starving children, and homeless families. We are confronted with the reality of want during this time of joy."
205,"Interview with the Vampire (The Vampire Chronicles, #1)",0345476875,Anne Rice,Barnes and Noble,4.3,deaf_dumb_blind,"Interview With The Vampire, the first of many books in the Vampire Chronicles, introduces the reader to Louis de Pointe du Lac and the life he lived, stretching over 200 years.  Narrated by Louis himself, he allows himself to be interviewed by an unsuspecting Daniel Malloy and he tells of his heart break, his ""birth into darkness"", his adventures as a creature of the night, and the moral battle he has within himself between his human conscience and the thirst of a vampire.  He also sheds light on his volatile relationship with his maker, Lestat de Lioncourt (whose origins are explained in the next book of The Vampire Chronicles).

Anne Rice describes her scenes to almost every detail, allowing the reader to vividly see and almost feel the sadness and despair within Louis life.  Incredible piece of work and a great beginning to a fantastic vampire series.  I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a fix of horror, passion, drama, and blood.  And I would definitely suggest this book to those who want to avoid the juvenile, mediocre quality of Twilight. The Vampire Chronicles is one of the best vampire series out there, easily a classic.

Also, if you enjoy the book, I very well suggest watching the film.  It stays close to the book, but also has Anne Rice herself as an adviser for the film."
205,"Interview with the Vampire (The Vampire Chronicles, #1)",0345476875,Anne Rice,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"I am very partial to vampire novels. As soon as I had the book in my hands, I plopped down on my bed to read it. I was soon caught in Louis' world. The eccentric, sensual, and absolutely heartwrenching story of a vampire, whose long existence brings up all the human emotions he never had. The hurt, love and desperate desire to his prey and his profound kindness and sympathy. It is a tragedy because it does not have a happy ending, but neverthelss, it is beautiful as it is. I devoured the book in one day, then waking up the next morning with it in my hands yet again, reading some parts I didn't understand. The book is very descriptive, but you really feel like you undestand the protagonist, and his agony. I thought the ending to be a great close, but again overshadows the beginning of a new story. The story of the boy who interview him in the first place! I thought it was ironic, and very foolish that the boy wanted to become a vampire after all that Louis told him. Like Louis says: ""This... after all I told you... is what you ask for?""I feel what Louis felt then; the desperation and the anger that even after all the wrongs of his life he told him, after all the death and all the sadness his existence had brought upon him, that he still wanted it. It is ironic because the boy will search for Lestat, and the story will most likely repeat itslef. Obviously not in the same way, but he will somewhat experience what Louis went through.This is a beautifully written book. Anne Rice is truly a remarkable author. I greatly recommend it."
205,"Interview with the Vampire (The Vampire Chronicles, #1)",0345476875,Anne Rice,Barnes and Noble,4.3,CourtneyChaos,"I fell in love with Anne Rice after I read this book. I instantly fell in love with her characters and became so ingrossed in the plot of the vampire chronicles that I had to have all the books at once. For those who wish to banish the dimmed vampires of Twilight from their mind, this book gets back to the roots: blood, lust, and an immortal with a mortal's compassion."
206,"The Selection (The Selection, #1)",0062059939,Kiera Cass,Barnes and Noble,4.6,kimba88,"This was a three point five. When the tale begins we meet America Singer, a caste five, who is secretly in love with Aspen a caste six. America lives at home with her parents and siblings. They are all musicians and artists who barely scrape out a living by performing and selling their art to the upper caste. A letter arrives from the King and Queen announcing that a girl will be selected from among thirty-five of the kingdom's eligible girls to marry Prince Maxon. The families of the contestants will be compensated and whether the girl wins or loses her caste and future will forever be changed. America&lsquo;s Mom is overjoyed at this opportunity for America. Stubborn, America wants no part in this, as she secretly plans to marry Aspen. Aspen encourages her to do enter. When her mother offers to allow her to keep half of her earnings, she jumps at the chance. After all only thirty-five girls will be selected. She feels confident she will not be among them. So of course she is selected and the tale that unfolds is fascinating. Watching the girls be transformed and the length at which some of them were willing to go was fun to read. What started out as a means to help her family, gets a lot more complicated when America develops feelings for the prince. The characters in the Selection were interesting. The protagonist America is at times very naive but overall she is strong willed, level headed and confident. She is kind and humble. These traits prevail throughout the novel. She never loses sight of who she is, where she came from and the plight of others. While all the other participants were trying to be who they thought the prince would marry, America remained herself and I found it refreshing. Aspen is a sweet young man, who is desperately in love with America and wants only the best for her. He pushes her away and then pulls her back. He struggles to deal with his conscience and his heart. Prince Maxon was delightful. I found him to be charming, brave, and compassionate. The love triangle will play a role in this series, and if I had to choose at this moment&hellip;I would have to say, &ldquo;Team Maxon&rdquo;. I am anxious to see how this plays out and look forward to reading book two. I adored America&rsquo;s sister Max and I am hoping to get to know the Queen more. The contestants were unique and showcased every personality from the snob to the shy. I loved some and despised others. Their actions had me laughing and shooting daggers. The world-building wasn&rsquo;t unique but I enjoyed it none the less. The novel offered a light depiction of a dystopian society. It always amazes me how writers convert our society to some of the strictest, most oppressive times in history after a cataclysmic event. We are all familiar with caste systems and countries ruled by kings and queens. There is conflict by outside rebels, and the caste system causes poverty. There are very strict rules about movement within castes and relationships. I did find the whole selection process interesting, and the back history of the wars that led to this current time in history. Overall, The Selection was a delightful read. I want to thank Edelweiss and Harper Teen for providing this ARC in exchange for my unbiased review."
206,"The Selection (The Selection, #1)",0062059939,Kiera Cass,Barnes and Noble,4.6,brbookworm,"I am going to tell you upfront that I am not a teenager reading this book. I am a college student, reading major that has to read so many young adult&rdquo; novels by the end of my semester I was hoping that this book, with its interesting title and cover would be just the &quot;pick me up&quot; I needed to get through my long assignments attached to each book I read and boy was I NOT disappointed. The characters our complex, witty and relatable, the story is sweet and the writing is full of emotion that you cannot help but get swept away.  Meet America Singer, an average girl with so many dreams, and of course a love of her life. Until section. America&rsquo;s life is turned upside down and this resilient girl is put to the test. Now, this young women is just one of 35 competing to be the next queen of her country, only she is not competing&hellip; or is she.  This book is full of twists, turns, love, war and everything that makes a good book great. The only negative thing I have to say is that we are all going to be held in suspense about what happens next as the second book of the series is not yet published. Happy Reading!"
206,"The Selection (The Selection, #1)",0062059939,Kiera Cass,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"I was so sure that i knew what was going to happen; but sge left us with just a freaking cliff hanger! When it said  , end of book one, i just about died. I was so mad i screamed silently into my pillow. It was amazing. A must read- especially if you enjoyed Wither"
207,"One for the Money (Stephanie Plum, #1)",0312362080,Janet Evanovich,Barnes and Noble,4.3,NookLover74,"I stumbled on this series while looking for downloads for my new nook.  The reviews were all so positive that I decided to try the first book in the series.  This book had all of the elements of a great, fun read...characters that captivate, laugh out loud humor, drama, and suspense.  It's neither overboard nor lack lustre, it's solid and incredibly entertaining!!!  I loved it!  I read it in one day and have already started on the second book! This may just be a new favorite author for me.  If it weren't for others that took the time to write reviews, I would've have never given it a try, I'm so grateful!"
207,"One for the Money (Stephanie Plum, #1)",0312362080,Janet Evanovich,Barnes and Noble,4.3,laura24,Enjoyed it- a lot and will read more from this talented writer.
207,"One for the Money (Stephanie Plum, #1)",0312362080,Janet Evanovich,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Aunt.Mary,"Whether you like romance, mystery, adventure, or humor, this book will satisfy.  I have never read a book that made me laugh out loud like this one.  The only problem is the series goes on forever and once you are hooked, you are hooked.  Some of the in-between books aren't as good, but they are still worth a read."
208,The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks,1400052173,Rebecca Skloot,Barnes and Noble,4.2,JonathanEisen,"When I started reading this story, I did not know what to expect.  I am a biologist and, though I do not work extensively on human studies (I study mostly bacteria) I have heard and read 100s of scientific studies that were based on work on ""HeLa"" cells. These cells are literally everywhere in research facilities.  But other than on rare occasions, there is rarely much discussion of the person behind these cells (or in fact, behind any cells used in research). I started the book with a bit of trepidation because it would have been easy for the author, Rebecca Skloot to sensationalize the history of the person behind these cells.

But I was wonderfully surprised once I started reading the book (and in fact, could not put it down). First, the book is incredibly well written and crafted - weaving together three (or more) threads: the life of Henrietta Lacks, the obsession of the author with the story of HeLa, and the science behind human cell line research. 

Second, and perhaps more important to me, the book is incredibly well balanced in telling the story. For example, it would have been easy for Skloot to vilify the scientists at Johns Hopkins who isolated the cell line and then continued to work on it as well as related topics.  (I note, I know some of these people as I used to have an Adjunct Appointment at Johns Hopkins). But in fact, Skloot is meticulously careful about researching the facts behind the story and in trying to explain what happened in the context of the times (e.g., she does a good job of describing how concepts of ""informed consent"" have changed over time).  Instead of simply portraying scientists as evil or blaming them for ""stealing"" HeLa cells, Skloot portrays scientists as they really are - frequently well intentioned but a bit naive at times about the repercussions of what they are doing. (I note, Skloot does not try to sugarcoat scientists or any others in the book either - when scientists clearly erred this is described. But what I really like about the portrayal is that the portrayals of the Lacks family, of scientists, and of others, is done without any excessive judging. She lets the readers come to their own decisions about whether what people did was good or bad or in between.  In this way, the book is nuanced and is really a history of science book.

Finally, I think it is worth pointing out that this book is incredibly timely.  As technology has advanced it is now becoming possible to determine the entire genetic makeup of individual people - and soon this will be possible at such a low cost that many people will have this done.  In addition, medical research is accelerating at a dizzying pace - with many large scale studies being done involving samples from 100s-1000s of people.  These studies have the potential to revolutionize medicine.  But it is going to be very important for the scientists involved and for society in general to continue to think about the issues associated with ""sharing"" information and samples.  The HeLa book is an important addition to this discussion and is written in such a way that just about anyone can read and understand it."
208,The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks,1400052173,Rebecca Skloot,Barnes and Noble,4.2,David_J_Kroll,"I read this book as a scientist whose PhD thesis work 20 years ago almost entirely made use of HeLa cells. HeLa cells were central to my first paper from my independent laboratory and fueled my first major research grant from the American Cancer Society. I say this because I thought I was a HeLa expert. Rebecca Skloot has taught me that I knew only a small fraction of the story that brought to me a gift that launched my scientific career.

This book is remarkable in that it is a painstakingly-documented and fact-checked account of science, ethics, and history, yet reads smoothly and engagingly as well to my colleagues with no background in science. Most importantly, Skloot brings to us the uncomfortable history of medical injustices to the African-American community that extends back to slave ships and today fuels the relative reticence of blacks to participate in clinical trials. The story is so touching and moved my heart to experience the torment shared by the Lacks family to the triumph and education of the Lacks family about the very real contributions of their matriarch's gift to science and humanity.

A native of New Jersey who has spent a third of his life in the American South, I am still often called a Yankee here. Skloot's book shares with the rest of the country and the world the culture and experience of life in the Jim Crow South and the place religion holds for a people who were sustained by their faith from slavery through struggles that continue today. My white privilege is real.

As for the cells themselves, yes, yes, Ms. Lacks did not give up her tumor tissue because she intended for the cells to be propagated and studied worldwide - her tissue was taken to the lab unknowingly and without consent as was done then with hundreds of patients at Johns Hopkins. But one has to read the Skloot book to also appreciate that researchers came back to the Lacks family 20 years later for tissue samples without compassion or an appreciation for the communication required to adequately inform the family about their motivations.

Skloot teaches us that the cultivation of the first immortalized human cell line opened the door to understanding how this could be done for more intractable cells in culture. She stimulated me to go back and read some of the 1950s papers by pioneers like Ted Puck, Richard Ham, and Harry Eagle on the requirements for mammalian cell growth in vitro that form the basis of techniques used in cancer and viral research laboratories worldwide. Many of these papers using HeLa cells appeared in the most prominent journals of then and today: Science, Nature, and the Journal of Experimental Medicine.

But step back for a moment as humans who stand on the shoulders of our forebearers: how can you look back on the breadth of discoveries enabled by the availability of HeLa cells and not feel some debt of gratitude toward this woman? How can one not feel compelled to honor her suffering and that of her family? For me, that is reason enough for this story to be told with the finesse and reverence Skloot so gently shares herein, aided by the respect that she earned from the Lacks family.

For those posting based upon perceptions or news accounts, I strongly encourage you to read the entire text even if you think you know the whole story. I assure you: you do not. We are indebted to Rebecca for her tenacious work over the last ten years to fulfill a curiosity in a woman she discovered 20 years ago in high school."
208,The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks,1400052173,Rebecca Skloot,Barnes and Noble,4.2,LCH47,"This is an amazing, fascinating true story about a poor black woman, Henrietta Lacks in the 1950s who became ill with cervical cancer. Her cells were taken from her body during treatment and harvested for medical research. They took two samples of the cells from her uterus. These Hela cells mass produced and have become immortal.Years of disinterest or misinformation kept the truth from Henrietta's family and the world. This book is a document in history and the extent the Lacks' have gone through to get the truth told about their mother. This book was obviously well researched, not just in the history but the personal aspect was engaging and interesting. Henrietta Lacks is a miracle. She helped find numerous vaccines and enabled the research and discovery of some of medical treatment after she was long gone.

Rebecca Skloot takes readers through the life of Henrietta Lacks, well beyond her years on this earth. We learn of her children, their children, and so on and also the history of scientific progress. Skloot weaves the human interest story of the Lackses with the historical progress of research, DNA, chromosomes and cells. This story is fascinating, inspiring and heartbreaking. I highly recommend! A treasure!"
209,"The Silence of the Lambs  (Hannibal Lecter, #2)",0099446782,Thomas Harris,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,Probably the best book i have ever read. Nice and suspensful with a large handful of creepy. It is an interesting way to look at criminal profiling from the view of Agent Clarice Starling. A great book to read in the middle of the night. Highly recommend. The movie is really good also.
209,"The Silence of the Lambs  (Hannibal Lecter, #2)",0099446782,Thomas Harris,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Guest,"This tale set the standard, and made Thomas Harris the standard-bearer of a new type of 'genre', if we must catagorize it, the edge-of-your-seat excitement novel which was at once a thriller, horror story, suspense novel, psychological drama, police/crime story, being none and all of these at the same time.  Mr. Harris has created for us two of the most memorable characters in all of fiction of any description or from any country.  It is this trilogy, and this tale in particular, that makes me sad for the people who have only seen the films, even as good as they are, and as brilliant as the performances of Sir Anthony, Jodie Foster, and Julianne Moore are.  What I mean is the incredible three-dimensionality of both characters.  They are not just the two-dimensional boogieman and the (generically used term) pure-blooded hero with spotless life and thoughts, and nothing but aye-jay-squared-away in thoughts, words, and deeds.  These are two people, both suffering from the mental pain of their past tragedies, who have gone in opposite directions in their lives.  Strangely enough (and this is, admittedly, pure opinion on my part) they are both on the same mission.  S/A Starling hunts a killer who operates under his own private code; a vigilante hunting down ghosts because those he truly would delight in killing are, in all probability, long gone.  Starling is a green but gifted investigator whose talents her senior, SAC Jack Crawford, eagerly makes use of, mostly because he has seen them before.  Then there is Starling herself, who seems at first to be determined to feel what society says she should feel - dread, fear, loathing.  The Doctor appears to follow his own established path of grab 'em, make applesauce of their minds, and drop them in a convenient gutter.  Both of them are taken by surprise; their collaboration works so very well in tracking down the perp of a terrible series of crimes, but their minds also meet on a higher plane neither has experienced before.  The doctor learns great respect for this 'kid' and her rapier that is quite capable of meeting his stroke for stroke.  The investigator finds an admitted killer, but also what she didn't expect, and which is so perfectly portrayed in that first glimpse of Anthony Hopkins in the film. A soft-spoken, cultured gentleman who can cut you with a word, he is honorable when he realizes that here is another mind sharp enough to parry his most personal slashes at her self-esteem, and her ethics are strong enough to fend off the less-honorable who tempt her to betray a trust because that trust comes from 'the monster.'  Ultimately, Starling's greatest sin is to walk away from this encounter intact, memtally and physically, and (horror of horrors!) is actually stronger and more confident for having done so.    I will wager any amount or item in one soundly confident prediction: this tale, and these characters will stand the test of time alongside the characters of Jane Ayre, Treasure Island, In Cold Blood and Poe's 'Murders of the Rue Morgue' in the storied history of fictional crime.  Paul Krendler's real-life portrayer in 'Hannibal' said in an interview around the tenth anniversary of 'Silence' on the movie screen that he was so amazed that people were doing doctoral dissertations on SOTL and the whole Starling-Lecter phenomenon.    I'm not.  Not one bit.  Hi from Texas and  happy reading!"

210,"Vampire Academy (Vampire Academy, #1)",159514174X,Richelle Mead,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Minnechicka,"I am a 28 year old woman reading this young adult series. I picked it up at the local Walmart one day because I was bored... I didn't expect much so I was very pleasantly surprised! Yeah, a lot of teen books are described as ""goody two shoes"" or whatever. The thing I like about them is that I can enjoy the characters and plot without the adult content. For an adult who wants to escape, I say it's perfect. Rose--the main character--and her inner struggle with her feelings for instructor, Dimitri and stirring emotions about wanting to go forge her OWN way kept me pretty hooked. I read all three of the available books in a WEEK. Well written, romantic and emotional. If you liked the Twilight series by Stephenie Meyer I think you will actually like this better. :)"

211,Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,0316010669,Malcolm Gladwell,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"Anyone looking for advanced insight into human nature will love this book.  Did you realize that the first six seconds of a personal encounter 'the handshake and greeting' are 80% predictive of the outcome of the encounter?  In 'Blink', Malcolm Gladwell will help you understand what happens during that first six seconds.  Whether you are socially struggling or a master networker, you should check this out.  Absolutely in keeping with his #1 best seller, 'The Tipping Point', now becoming a classic."
211,Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,0316010669,Malcolm Gladwell,Barnes and Noble,4,Nicholas_E_Sparks,"Gladwell is undoubtedly a competent writer: his charisma, seen even in his writing, and his use of seemingly unrelated examples to drive his points (no pun intended) are as consistent as they are effective, not to mention admirable. However, with this work, Gladwell treads into shaky territory, proposing his theories with his usual tone of universality within one of the most fundamentally unstable sciences of cognitive psychology -one may note that he is indeed a psychologist, but a more perceptive reader would realize that his field of study is more socially psychological, if not sociological altogether.

Even with his charm and talent, extending empirical claims into the realm of the invisible psyche is a stretch for Gladwell. As is expected, he presents numerous samples to support his claim, but much of his research seems to lack an empirical mass that would give his abstract propositions more credible foundations; there is no doubt that Gladwell possesses the capability of formulating an intangible theory with empirical roots, but his principal error was in his attempt to do it with so few pages.....at least with such a large font he uses!"
211,Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,0316010669,Malcolm Gladwell,Barnes and Noble,4,RobbieMA,"Entertaining and interesting book but not particularly useful.  It talks about thin-slicing, which is how we make decisions/judgements on a small amount of data and in the blink of an eye.  These judgements are usually very accurate, however trying to analyze why you made the decision is often a waste of time.  Rationalizing these decisions often causes you to erroneously come to a different conclusion."
212,Atonement,038572179X,Ian McEwan,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"At first I didn't know what to think because the first part of the book is very detailed and not fast paced.  I almost gave up, but I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie.  I'm glad I stayed with it, because as I read further I couldn't put the book down.  As you read, you will think you understand why the author titled the book 'Atonement,' but not until the final chapter will you comprehend its true significance.  The   story haunted me for days afterward.  One of the best books I've ever read."
212,Atonement,038572179X,Ian McEwan,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Taylor-Marie,"Sadly I have not read any other books to compare this book to, but Atonement surely is a great book to read for someone starting Ian McEwan's novels. His writing style is exquisite. McEwan's writing manages to describe the story while moving the story along. So far I found it to be the best book that intertwines the troubles of war and the troubles at home with the main characters. His choice of switching point of views is very well done, although a bit confusing in the beginning the book. Nevertheless, this is definetely a good buy for your personal library."
212,Atonement,038572179X,Ian McEwan,Barnes and Noble,3.9,fitz12383,"I usually make a point of not seeing a movie before I get a chance to read the book, but the opposite is true for my experience with McEwan's Atonement. I rented the movie last summer from Netflix and as soon as the movie ended, I stared at the blank screen for a moment, blinked a couple of times in wonderment, and then hit play and watched it in its entirety a second time. Needless to say, I was completely entranced with the storyline and the cinematography. All of this is to say that after having such a wonderful experience with the movie adaptation, I began to worry that I'd ruined the possibility of having a good reading experience with the novel. I find it difficult to read a book after I've seen the movie since I have so many preconceived notions of the characters' appearance and eccentricities locked into my head visually. 

Never fear. I loved the book just as much as the movie. I actually listened to this book, mostly while driving, and I'm quite lucky I didn't wind up in a ditch somewhere due to my complete inattention to my surroundings. I became so wrapped up in the characters, the story, and the heart wrenching consequences of one thirteen-year-old's misinterpretation of a number of events and a rash decision. This was my first foray into Ian McEwan's writing and it definitely won't be the last. I was mesmerized with his writing style. The characters, especially that of the young Briony, were so well-drawn. She is so frustratingly self-absorbed and narcissistic in the beginning of the novel, and her imaginative whims that so many young girls possess lead to such a catastrophic turn of events. I'll say no more. You must read it for yourself. 

I don't often reread books anymore due to the sheer quantity of amazing novels out there that I must get my hands on, but I can definitely say this is a book I will revisit, perhaps a few times, in the future."

I loved this book, despite the fact it made me ¿absurdly sad¿. Kafka is a genius and the story is a testament to the power that the horrific, weird, funny and tragic elements of being human effect us all. The bottom line is READ THIS STORY!"

BUT, if you're looking for an action packed thriller based on the greek gods in modern times (duh, the headline), then you've come to the right place. Percy Jackson found out in previous books that he is teh half-blood son of Posiedon. When you're a half-blood in a world like ours, you are either targeted by mythical monsters, misunderstood by mortals, or completely neutral in the minds of the gods... Percy is only lucky enough to be teo of these things, since most of the gods want him either dead, or they just don't care. This time, Percy is in for a doosy of a ride when he is dodging monsters such as the Manticore, or the Nemean Lion. Not only that, but he must save a friend, and a god, and maybe even take the full force of the Titan's curse! If you're ready for the ride of your life, then hop on the back of Blackjack, the black pegasus, and hold on tight!"

They should totally make a movie out of these books. The descriptions are mezmorizing and the consepts of modern day gods and demi-gods inspires me. I hope more people will read these books.

A fun and great read for anyone."
215,Ready Player One,030788743X,Ernest Cline,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Caitlamos,"Words cannot effectively convey my gratitude to Cline for writing such an imaginative, wholly absorbing world for me to live in. Let me make this perfectly clear : I am not big on the 80's. I have no in depth knowledge of video-games. And mostly everything mentioned in Clines book went totally over my head. With all this in mind, it was STILL one of the best books I have ever read ( and I've read A LOT of books). It was so good that I read it all in one go, over the course of 12 hrs.
   I was literally biting my nails, and when I wasn't reading it in bed, I was on the edge of my seat. When I had to stand up to refill my coffee cup (because as far as Im concerned, the only thing you can drink while reading this book is coffee. The reason being that sleep is just not an option) I was pacing at extraordinary speeds,  narrowly missing pets in the process.   
   If you don't read this book you are missing out. Big time. I will most definitely re-read this book, a great honor let me tell you, as only a few books out of hundreds have ever held the position. I will also force all of my friends to read it because after ch.1 they'll be hooked. 
  So thank you Mr. Cline again, for crafting this wholly absorbing, original, and entertaining world for us all to enjoy. You did good :)    (PS. THEY'RE MAKING A MOVIE!!! :D &lt;3)"
216,The Art of Racing in the Rain,1554681723,Garth Stein,Barnes and Noble,4.4,vivico1,"Most people are saying, if you're a dog lover, you will love this book. Do NOT miss out reading or recommending this story by limiting it to only dog lovers or racing fans. I have no dogs and know little of racing. This book transcends both! It will also make you a fan of both. Garth Stein has written a wonderful book about a great character, a dog named Enzo, whom I came to love and hang on his every thought. Enzo has a better grasp of life than most people do, even if ironically, he wants to be a human. There are life lessons here that will stay with you and put a smile on your face and in your heart as you learn about living for today and how we choose to live today. You will be wondering about a couple of things, what am I manifesting in my life to bring joy into it and, what the heck is my dog or cat thinking anyway?? This is a wonderfully inspiring and entertaining book. Two barks for Enzo! And FIVE stars for Garth Stein for a most delightful reading EXPERIENCE."
216,The Art of Racing in the Rain,1554681723,Garth Stein,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"This book was amazing! It left me in all sorts of moods by the end of the day. One day id read for about an hour or two and be done with sad thoughts of the book, and other days id read for up to five hours and feel chipper on the inside. It is told through the eyes and ears of a dog who likes to compare life to racing in the rain. But hes not just an ordinary dog, he believes that he will be reincarnated as a man. I am also proud to say that this is my favorite book so far in life. Even though i may be nothing but a 6th grader and probably wont take my opinion, i loved this book and i think you should read it! Probably like everyone else, this book left me pondering the thought ""what would my dog say to me if he could talk"" and ""what would i do as my dog self."" I hope you take my advice because it will pay of. Oh, and Enzo says hi!"
216,The Art of Racing in the Rain,1554681723,Garth Stein,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Veggiechiliqueen,"Enzo, a philosopher-dog with terrier/lab origins, has one wish: to be reincarnated as a human. Enzo's owner, Denny, is a semi-professional race car driver who talks to him like he's his equal, so Enzo is well-versed in the art of racing, particularly in the rain. Enzo and Denny watch in-car race videos of Denny's races, and the rest of Enzo's education comes from countless hours of television (some educational, some not). Enzo admits that he's frustrated by his lack of ability to communicate with humans, from his too-floppy tongue that fails to form words to his lack of opposable thumbs that won't allow him to open doors. He tries to conquer his animal instincts around Denny's young daughter Zoe (no biting and no chasing), and struggles to love Denny's wife Eve, whom he sees as competition. When multiple tragedies strike Denny's home, Enzo is as supportive as he can be under the circumstances. Towards the end of his life, he is reflective about his mission on earth, and looks forward to being reincarnated as a human, so he can finally talk to Denny as a man instead of barking incoherently. Enzo is a funny, observant narrator, who, although not book-learned (he was never able to teach himself to read), is intelligent, articulate, and has a wicked sense of humor (jalapenos plus obnoxious in-laws plus expensive Berber carpet, for example). His deep insights into human (and canine) nature ring true, especially when he is the only other witness to an incident that nearly ruins Denny's life, and Enzo plays a role in reversing Denny's rock-bottom fortunes. Delightfully told, The Art of Racing in the Rain is an outsider's look at what makes humans tick, as well as an ode to the art of Formula One and racing. It's a love song to the simple pleasures in life (walking in Seattle's drizzle, stretching out on a sun-warmed sidewalk) and the bonds we forge with those around us. Truthfully, most of the time I kept forgetting that Enzo was even a dog, although he does talk about his early puppyhood at a Washington farm, for Enzo is determined to shed his canine form for a human one, and this includes his thinking processes and actions (as his hips gradually deteriorate, he finds ways to mask his limp so that Denny doesn't suspect). The novel's ending may be a bit too sweet for some, but I found it to be a perfect ending to a tale that only Enzo could tell. Stein's rich, evocative language and heart-tugging storyline involving Enzo's family will be sure to delight fans of Marley & Me: Life and Love with the World's Worst Dog and other dog-themed novels."
217,"The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed America",0739303406,"Erik Larson, Tony Goldwyn",Barnes and Noble,4.1,TeensReadToo,"In 1893, Chicago was gearing up for its shining moment on the international stage. The city had been selected to host the World's Fair, beating out New York and a number of other American contenders. A prominent local architect, Daniel Burnham, had taken the reins to organize and construct the massive project. He assembled a dream team of architects, landscapers, engineers, and other professionals to help pull the fair together. Certainly Chicago could outdo the Paris Fair, which had been a worldwide success years earlier. Unfortunately for Burnham and his team, everything that could go wrong, did go wrong. Due to a lack of organization and bickering among the committees responsible for the fair, construction began far later than it should have. Partially completed buildings blew over and burned down. Union workers threatened strikes. One sideshow act showed up a year early, while another (which was believed to be made up of cannibals) killed the man sent to retrieve them and never showed up at all. And there was a monster on the loose. A man who used the chaos of Chicago at this time in history to conceal the murders of dozens of people - many of them young, single women. A man who constructed a building with stolen money, then used the building as a slaughterhouse to lure, kill, and dispose of his victims. THE DEVIL IN THE WHITE CITY is a terrific book. It is nonfiction, but it reads like a novel. The real-life details of this story seem almost too bizarre to be true, yet this is one example of the old saying that ""truth is stranger than fiction."" The author, Erik Larson, even includes a lengthy section at the back where he documents his facts and explains his suppositions. The book's chapters alternate between the World's Fair and the exploits of serial killer, Dr. H.H. Holmes. I found myself enjoying both stories, as they ran parallel throughout the book. The Herculean task of putting together the fair in record time was fascinating, and the sociopathic actions of Dr. Holmes were chilling. It made for a brilliant contrast - just when the frustrations of the Fair seemed overwhelming, the book switched to Dr. Holmes as he lured yet another young woman into his web. And just when Dr. Holmes' evil seemed too much to bear, the chapter would end and the reader would be back at the World's Fair dealing with political back stabbing, instead of Holmes' more literal variety. I rarely read nonfiction, but this book came highly recommended to me, so I gave it a try. I'm so glad I did, too. It offers a wonderful historical perspective on Chicago and the world near the close of the 19th century. For a Chicago-area native like me, its frequent mentions of famous local names, like Burnham and Adler and Marshall Field, that still grace street signs and the sides of buildings, were an added treat. Just a brief word of warning, though: it does contain some of the dreaded ""adult themes."" Some of Dr. Holmes' crimes are described - although not too graphically - and they might be upsetting for ""younger or more sensitive"" readers. I strongly recommend THE DEVIL IN THE WHITE CITY to anyone who enjoys an engrossing, well-written story, whether they normally read fiction or nonfiction. In particular, if readers have a book report in school, this book should be considered. It makes history come alive."
217,"The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed America",0739303406,"Erik Larson, Tony Goldwyn",Barnes and Noble,4.1,LaceyAB,"Having some knowledge of Chicago I found this book very interesting. I initially thought I would like the book primarily because of the murder mystery. I ended up enjoying the Architectural part of the book even better. The author seemed to really do his research with the people who helped make Chicago the selection for the World Fair in 1893. The history and the way it was written made me feel for the people who worked, lived and died so long ago. They didn't have modern medicine and died young. The lack of modern convenience made life so, so hard.  In 1874, I could sense the beginning of Big Finance and Big organizations. At twenty-eight years old a young architect tells a friend ""My idea,"" he said, ""is to work up a big business, to handle big things, deal with big business men, and to build up big organization, for you can't handle big things unless you have an organization"" (Larson 21). From this Burnham and Root prospered by helping the city become the birthplace of skyscrapers. I had to remind myself this book was real history. It was so entertaining I felt as if I was reading a fiction novel. Some of the architecture stands today in Chicago and this makes this book even more exciting. What I enjoyed most about this book is that I felt I was reading two books at the same time. I had no dislikes in this book and I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves murder mysteries, history and architecture. Definitely one of the best books I've ever read."
217,"The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed America",0739303406,"Erik Larson, Tony Goldwyn",Barnes and Noble,4.1,VickiK,"The title of the book is misleading.  Basically the book is two entirely, unrelated stories that have nothing to do with each other.  If you like architecture and the history thereof, you may very well enjoy this book.  However, if you are a mystery/thriller buff, it will be a big disappointment."
218,"Bared to You (Crossfire, #1)",0425263908,Sylvia Day,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"First off, I haven't written a review in a while. After reading BARED TO YOU by SYLVIA DAY I felt the need to. Sylvia Day brought Eva and Gideon's character to life. You'll love their story, I promise.

If you're looking for a book similar To Fifty Shades of Grey by E.L. James then BARED TO YOU is THE BOOK! It was recommended on the Romance board under Books similar to Fifty Shades of Grey and Fifty Shades Darker. In my opinion I think it's better than Fifty Shades. It may or may not have to do with Sylvia Day being a seasoned author. You can be the judge of that.

From the moment Eva and Gideon meet, they're pulled towards each other. Whether it's physical attraction or love at first site, it was a connection they couldn't deny. Shortly after beginning their relationship they find that they're both broken. Eva's revelation of her past and then realization of Gideon's brings them closer. Yet it also exposes how fragile they each are. They're relationship is emotional, intense and complicated. Gideon and Eva are obsessed, possessive and jealous of each other. Put all those verbs and adjectives together and they're sex is explosive as well as they're relationship, if they're not careful.

I can't wait for the next book. My only hope is that it's not like Fifty Shades Darker. In Fifty Shades Darker, I just felt saturated with the sex scenes. It seemed as if the sex scenes were overpowering the storyline. About half way through I just skipped the sex scenes. By the end of the book, I felt as if I read the first book all over again. Needless to say I haven't had the inclination to read the third book, Fifty Shades Freed. I'm not saying I'll never read it, I'm just not curious enough to pay $9.99 to know the conclusion."

With the ""Twilight"" movie being exactly 5 weeks away, this book is the perfect antidote to all the antsiness fans like me are feeling now.  I can't wait to finally see the movie!The book, aside from containing numerous color, stunning, glossy photographs of both movie stills and production pictures, provides insightful interviews with the creative forces behind the making of the movie - the producers (Greg Mooradian, Karen Rosenfeld, Wyck Godfrey), the sublimely talented director, Catherine Hardwicke, the stunt director, Andy Cheng, to name but a few.  To be able to read their firsthand accounts of the process that went into bringing ""Twilight"" to the big screen is to take the journey with them, to feel their anxiety, their elation and their pride.  To have some of the visual effects explained is to enhance your appreciation of the technical aspects of filmmaking too.   Through the photographs, we are given a good number of windows into the film, and the vision in our minds of how certain scenes will be played out is more real now.  In my opinion, it only serves to excite audiences more, to draw them in ever closer to seeing the film.  Mark Cotta Vaz's writing is clear and easy to navigate, and overall, the book's presentation is pure eye candy for every Twilight fan.Bring it home, put your feet up on a chair, and enjoy!"

221,"A Child Called ""It"" (Dave Pelzer #1)",1558743669,Dave Pelzer,Barnes and Noble,4.8,AthenaR7a,"A Child Called ""It"", written by David Pelzer, is a heartbreaking memoir about a young boy looking for love. His violently abusive mother beats him constantly, with the stench of alcohol in her breath, while his so called ""hero"" of a dad and four brothers refuse to help. After David runs to school every day, because his mother won't give him a ride, the school nurse examines him one day and notices all of his cuts and bruises. Even though the nurse thinks that his mother is abusive, David, out of fear, will not tell the family's secret.  One day, David's mother pulls his arm out of his socket. When she takes David to the hospital, she lies and says he fell out of bed but that she was too late to try to catch him. It seems that the more she hurts David, the better liar she gets. But that's not even the half of it. David's nightmare is the worst case of child abuse I have ever heard of.
	Even though the book was sad, it had to be one of the most inspiring memoirs I have ever read. David Pelzer must be the BRAVEST person I will ever hear about! Out of five stars, I would definitely give this book five, even though I want to give it more! I think this book should be for kids 12 + because it is violent and really sad. It could scare little kids and they might not really understand it. For people that are over 12, you will love it! I've only read it once, but I could read it over and over again."
221,"A Child Called ""It"" (Dave Pelzer #1)",1558743669,Dave Pelzer,Barnes and Noble,4.8,AliceK7E,"Do you like scary and on the edge of your seat type of books? Then this is the book for you! This memoir is about a boy named Dave Pelzer, who gets severely abused by his alcoholic mother. He has to find a way to survive from his evil mother's obsession to try and kill him. In the book David says, "" Suddenly I began to realize the longer I could keep myself off the top of the stove, the better my chances were for staying alive."" This is just one scene of the book where his mother is really close to killing him. His mother has four other children, all boys, but only David is the one she likes to abuse. When David was younger his mother was nice and his family was (to him) the best family one could ever have. Then his mother started getting stressed out and would take it out on him. It became an addiction to her to beat him up and to torture him. Just think what it feels like to be alone in a world were everybody shuns you and your mother beats you and tortures you and you don't even know why.
      I thought this book was many things: suspenseful, very descriptive, scary, sad, and emotional. The author, Dave Pelzer, has had a terrible life and I think this book is a way for him to let go of his past and start over in a new way. Dave Pelzer is a very good author, and if you like this book you might also want to read his sequels, The Lost Boy and A Man Named Dave; these books help ease the pain that Dave has shown you in A Child Called ""It"". A Child Called ""it"" is a #1 National and International Bestseller, so, if you want to read about a boy who faced death right in the face and survived the worst abuse the world has ever seen, you will want to read this book. If you don't like the sound of that, then you might not want to read it. You probably do not want to read this book if you are under the age of ten maybe older. I wasn't sure about the book, but now that I have read it, I am so glad I did. The book is life changing!"
221,"A Child Called ""It"" (Dave Pelzer #1)",1558743669,Dave Pelzer,Barnes and Noble,4.8,Anonymous,"Never before has a book had such an impact on me and brought forth such emotions in me that I if I could foster all of the abused and neglected kids in the world I would. Davids story is an important one that everyone should read, for the plight of the small defenseless child is one we should all pay attention to and we should never be afraid to speak out against those who would do them harm.  At first, David Pelzer lived a healthy and normal life with his parents and brothers. His mother, however, unexpectedly transformed into a monster, venting her anger on her helpless child. David was submerged in freezing cold water, forced to eat his own vomit, slept in the basement under the stairs, stabbed, and forced to sit on a burning stove. These are just a few of the torturous games that his mother used to play. She treated him not like her son, but like an &quot;it&quot;. David suffered both mental and physical abuse. In order to survive from his mother's sick games, David used willpower. Through all of her torturous games, David's inner strength began to emerge.
This book is a perfect example of how the human spirit can provide strength in the toughest of situations. David's spirit helped him to survive through his mother's emotional and physical abuse. He refused to let his mother win. He had no one to help him so he learned how to fend for himself. His courage and determination saved him from all of the suffering that he endured at such a young age.
David is a living testament of resilience. His faith and personal responsibility helped him transform into an emotionally healthy and competent adult. A large percentage of emotionally and physically abused children become abusive in their adult years. The abusiveness could be a cycle, passed down from generation to generation. Their rage and pain of being abused could be turned on themselves or the ones they love. David, at a young age, showed strong signs of being a planner as well as a problem solver. These character traits, along with caring adults (nurses, teachers, social workers, etc.), help him to become resilient. David's inner strength helped him turn shame into pride and rejection into acceptance."

I agree, the ending is rushed (preparing us for the next book, no doubt) and several things are left unexplained, which is annoying. However, Lauren Kate writes beautifully and makes you feel like Luce feels. It's also different than all the Twilight re-creations going around out there--no vampires here!

225,East of Eden,0142000655,John Steinbeck,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"A well-written book, a classic deemed worthy of reading. Steinbeck does a great job of making the piece of literature entertaining. I felt glued to the book many times because the plot would be wonderfully constructed, leading readers on an adventurous journey through the lives of the characters in the Salinas Valley.What surprised me the most were the characters in the story. Each individual character had his or her own unique personality. Each person seemed real and true to life. I would be going through the book and start saying to myself ""oh this character reminds me of so and so."" Plus, the characters are dynamic and many of their personalities are not at the extremes, but instead they have both the good qualities and bad qualities of mankind. I love how I can read into each character and judge him or her through his or her actions. The subtlety in revealing the motives behind each character was astonishing. The way Steinbeck depicted the characters through their dialogue and actions was overwhelming as I soon developed my personal opinion on each character. It made me feel like I was involved in the story itself.Adding to the amazing characters is in intricate, well-developed story line. The plot was complex in that there were many subplots running through the main action. However, when I was reading, the complexity of the story did not hinder my progression because everything seemed to flow. The story was being pieced together in a rhythmic fashion as one event leads to another. The biblical allusion to Cain and Abel was also a fun thing to locate. After reading the story of Cain and Abel, I would go through the East of Eden and get excited when I would notice the similarity or the differences between East of Eden and the biblical story of Cain and Abel. Steinbeck truly does a fascinating job of weaving his story together. His work is fascinating and artful.Although the book is rather long, the wonderful characters and amazing plot line makes up for it ten times over. I highly recommend this book to those who appreciate good writing that stays with you for days on end, and then some!"
225,East of Eden,0142000655,John Steinbeck,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"Some books are easy to read quickly, enjoy, and forget, but others exert a huge influence that isn't as easy to discard from your mental library. In my fifteen years of life, my hands passed through an insane number of books, but only one held the power to open the doors to my changed perspective about reading and the world. At first sight, the length of East of Eden led me to thinking of it as an encyclopedia.

East of Eden is a story that combines good and evil, strength and weakness, love and hate, beauty and ugliness, and many more nearly impossible contradictions. It's an in depth look at different people who are related to one another and the effect they have on each other. This book deals with good versus evil in Salinas Valley, California, during the early 1900's and displays the amount of evil that is in one family and how it grows among all people. Over and over again, this book questions the reader whether evil is something that is fated or if our lives are ruled by moral choice.

I closed the book learning that our circumstances do not determine our lives, instead our lives are determined by our choices. We have that option to decide not to be influenced by our dark family histories, but instead select from a number of possibilities to live a more positive life. Although at times human history may place forces into our lives that cannot be controlled, we always have the authority and external strength to use our free will to choose between good and evil. At the end of all things, our free will is the ultimate decider in the course of moral destiny. Simply put, the big idea in here insists on everyone to forget the past and forge a better future. At the very end, both good and evil are inseparable opposites that must coexist. 

After all, I found this strange and original work of art to be extremely enduring with its very rich and intensive themes that made me escape outside of the words printed on the pages. My favorite part of all was grabbing phenomenal, thought provoking quotes from this book and applying them to reality. Good and evil was definitely proved superior in strength, power, and influence. I stared to think broadly about all the things that could possibly prevail in this world. Once I opened the book, I was able to quickly fly into the never ending words of utmost attraction and charm.

Steinbeck is a brilliant writer, who can incorporate creativity, curiosity, enthusiasm, motivation, originality, philosophy, thoughtfulness, and so much more, to mesmerize the reader and have the reader envy him. This book might be long and, at times, slow, however it is well worth the read. I recommend it to anyone who wants to live life and explore and discover not only an extraordinary book, but also another part of themselves. 
Since the age of twelve, I've read the book three times, and every time I've read it, I learned something different and my insights slightly changed. With no doubt, if I pick this book up again in the next fifty years of my life, it will still hold the power to captivate me and move me. When I look back to my last moments with this book, I see that my initial thought was never really wrong; East of Eden did serve as an encyclopedia for adventure, fantastic writing, indescribable imagination, overwhelming amounts of knowledge, uninterrupted inspiration and thoughts, and strong emotions."
225,East of Eden,0142000655,John Steinbeck,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Guest,"If you don't mind epics and you love finely-drawn characters, you'll adore this book.  Each character becomes real, and each of them are fascinating, especially Kate, the cruel adulteress and madam whose presence haunts both her sons.  I can't possibly summarize the whole book, but trust me:  The story's great, the characters are wonderful, and the message is admirable (a rarity in modern fiction).  The James Dean film does justice to the character of Cal, while the Jane Seymour miniseries does justice to Kate.  I'd recommend both, but neither do justice to the novel as a whole."
226,Dark Places,0307341569,Gillian Flynn,Barnes and Noble,4.1,BRICK-0_8,"This is one of the better authors that I've read in quite some time. Often the assumption with dark material is that it's made out to shock and to create a sense of morbid interactions among the main characters, but this is anything but. The story swallows you and leaves you gasping for air. The characters are fully developed and allow for you to care for their outcomes. Finally, I felt for the characters!! I found myself stopping at the end of each chapter, thinking, and then continuing on to see what the next one would unravel; digging deeper and deeper into the reasons behind the violent murders that took place almost 25 years prior. It's an intense read, but very captivating. I would recommend this book and the author to my demographic (23 years old) in a heartbeat. So, stop reading this review and buy the thing already. It's that good."
226,Dark Places,0307341569,Gillian Flynn,Barnes and Noble,4.1,WOlsen,"Libby Day is one of the best drawn sociopathic, near-pathetic, well-voiced characters I have read in a long while.

228,"The Nanny Diaries (Nanny, #1)",0312291639,"Emma McLaughlin, Nicola Kraus",Barnes and Noble,3.9,cloggiedownunder,"2.5 stars

The Nany Diaries is the first book in the Nanny series by American authors and ex-nannies, Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus. We start with a nanny called Nanny. Then we have parents Mr X and Mrs X, and their four-year-old son, Grayer. And a potential boyfriend who never gets beyond HH (=Harvard Hottie). So, ignore the silly names, and wade through the interview experiences, the ridiculous demands of these ultra-rich socialites and their first-world problems, and the brand name soup, and there’s actually a reasonable story. Which is that the nanny often has a much better relationship with the children than either of the parents do. And that all that money doesn’t ensure a stable marriage or a happy childhood.

Nanny lacks backbone (but not self-pity) and makes quite a few unwise decisions. Nonetheless, her dedication to her four-year-old charge is genuine. The Xes are, no doubt, an amalgamation of the worst parents the authors have encountered: pretentious, shallow and selfish. This tale gives the reader some laughs, some head-shaking and some gasps at the behaviour of the rich. Is it entertaining enough that readers will want to read the sequel? Doubtful."

When they turned this into an eBook they must have outsourced it to someone/somewhere where English is not the language because tehre are words that make no sence whatsoever, ""die"" intead of ""the"" on uncountable instances, unexplaineable ""99"" here and there ( instead of C, 6 instead of e and so on.  Really frustrating......  I feel bad for the authors sicne I am sure they paid someone to do the job.  Would also expect B&N to have someone at least spot check eBooks since it is such a new product.  Disappointing to have paid for this book."

This book has an amazing amount of detail that will keep you imagining about each chapter for hours. I would recommend this book to anyone with an open mind and a wild imagination. Instant Classic on my shelf

It was very strange, but it kept me interested.  My favorite character throughout this whole book was the Caterpillar.

I'm 19 and I never knew that ""Alice in Wonderland"" was a book before it was a Disney ""Classic"". My sister and I were wondering around Barnes and Noble and she stumbled onto this book. She purchased it and attempted to read it but she's only 12 and therefor couldn't really understand some of the wordings (It's written in an old style). I was bored one rainy day and picked it up. I couldn't put it down until I'd finished the whole thing. It's a lovely book and it really does remind me of being a child. I giggled a lot throughout. Overall, good read."
230,Persuasion,0192802631,"Jane Austen, James Kinsley, Deidre Shauna Lynch",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"Persuasion is a powerful book that strongly impacts the mind of any reader. I read this book for a research paper I had to write this year in high school, and I fell in love with it. Apart from the fact that I experienced the emotions described in this book, Jane Austen presents the material in such a way that the reader can comprehend, and fully grasp, the struggle of Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot. This is truly a tremendous masterpiece. I strongly recommend it."
230,Persuasion,0192802631,"Jane Austen, James Kinsley, Deidre Shauna Lynch",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,This is one of my all time favorite books. I have read it several times in paperback and after having to sell almost all of my books for a move I was excited to see this free version. The formatting is fairly decent. There are random numbers and letters throughout and some of the line breaks are odd but it's not hard to read and really isn't annoying. Some of the paragraphs run on but that was how my other copy of the book was. I could be coming from a different perspective on the reason the formatting really doesn't bother me. I was a history major and some of the things that I had to read from this time period (and others) were not edited for ease of reading. Good copy if you are interested in reading it.

231,Sarah's Key,0312370830,Tatiana de Rosnay,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"It has been a long time since I read a book that truly made me weep. It is amazing to read about the 1942 Jewish roundups in France, known as the Vel d'Hiv. It is a part of history that has been buried. De Rosnay weaves a quite personal and believable fictional story about the character Sarah and her family with facts about the Vel d'Hiv atrocity. It is a very moving novel about something we should never accept nor forget. This is a book you cannot put down once you get started. Highly recommended!"
231,Sarah's Key,0312370830,Tatiana de Rosnay,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"At first, I found myself having difficulty putting this book down. The chapters were short, Julia&rsquo;s mission clear, and Sarah&rsquo;s storyline was gripping, fast-paced, and terribly tragic. However, after Sarah&rsquo;s voice ends, so does the interest for me. Upon first reading, I thought that this book would be more about Sarah and her journey through the holocaust, focusing on her emotions, development, and grief.  Rather, it was more about the life of Julia, the journalist, which I didn&rsquo;t particularly care about.  I was less interested in reading about Julia&rsquo;s failed marriage and mid-life baby crisis. 

I felt more satisfaction in reading about Sarah&rsquo;s life and the Vel d&rsquo;Hiv round-up (of which I was previously, sadly unaware), and would have liked more on the aftermath of the war and its impact on Sarah and her family.  I am glad to have read the book because of the historical significance of Vel d&rsquo;Hiv. However, Julia&rsquo;s story took up too much of the end, felt contrived, and was too predictable."

In my opinion, it was a little slow at times, but it definitely picked up at other times. The book appears to be setting up a great story. I will definitely read the rest of the series.

233,Love in the Time of Cholera,140003468X,"Gabriel Garc??a M??rquez, Edith Grossman",Barnes and Noble,3.7,L.Emerson,"This is the most gorgeous book I've ever read, not just for the plot, which is interesting, but because it is written with the highest level of storytelling skill. I thoroughly loved it. Readers looking for more than just a good book will be well satisfied. The most discriminating critics, wanting to give their time over only to a true work of modern literature, will find it here. It was originally written in Spanish, and was probably a wonderfully crafted piece of literature in the author's native language. After all, it did win the Nobel Prize. But I believe a tremendous amount of credit for the lushness of this work in this, its English version, belongs to the unsung translator who did an absolutely stunning job. Like most of us, I've read translations of other works that seemed a bit clunky or repetitive. But this one was masterful, every page containing new descriptions that leapt off the page with bright clarity and clever originality. The Mexican, Caribbean and South American locations described in the book came to life in vivid detail. Yet for all its exotic richness and scope, the story is still very accessible, the emotions universal, relatable. Characters are developed, a wide gamut of tempers and passions flair all over the place, scenes build across the pages with crescendo. It is even funny at times. I doubt the movie came close to this depth of storytelling. If you saw the film and didn't care for it, don't hold it against the book."

To all of you who are disappointed by this novel or ""don't get it"" it's because you are falling into Marquez's ""trap"". This book is not a love story, but more a treatise on the subject of love ""in all its many forms"". The central relationship between Florentino and and Fermina owes more to Nabakov's Lolita than it does to Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. It's the way Marquez tells the story that is such a joy, to be savoured and enjoyed."

Unfortunately, like Nobel prize winner William Faulkner, this reading requires the reader to reflect, re-read and digest the amazingly descriptive prose; Oprah's only &quot;mistake&quot; in some of her book club choices is that the average reader , often wants a shallow tale that requires little cultural knowledge and even less reflection."
234,Speak,014131088X,Laurie Halse Anderson,Barnes and Noble,4.5,1Katherine1,"Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson is a 198 paged book written in 1999 and published by Penguin Putnam Inc. It is a young adult book that is taught in many different freshman English classrooms since it does have a 9.4 grade level on the SMOG readability test.
This book deals with the freshman year of a girl who was raped at a party the summer between middle school and high school. She doesn't tell anyone what happened. Speak dissects the multiple difficulties she encounters as she keeps silent about what happened to her and how her reactions cause her parents, basically the entire student body and most teachers to react negatively towards her. It also looks at how Melinda, the main character, finally comes to terms with what happened to her and her confrontation of the rape and rapist; ending with her finally telling her story.
This book has been criticized and censored as a teaching tool due to the subject matter being considered too `difficult' and `dark' for such a young audience and the plot being too `formulaic.' The plot is a bit formulaic but this only accents the bare honesty of Melinda's troubles and the complex emotions she is feeling. Personally, I believe this book to be very true to life, correctly depicting the reactions of a rape victim who turns survivor. The subject matter is dealt with in a very true and honest manner, something that is important for this grade level. This book looks at a very real problem and deals with it in a very real way. Thus this subject matter is made appropriate for the grade level through the way it is written about and the conversations it than creates. Speak is the most true to life book I have found on this subject matter at any readability or grade level and I highly recommend it to anyone who can deal with an honest portrayal of a horrible occurrence."
234,Speak,014131088X,Laurie Halse Anderson,Barnes and Noble,4.5,elena6375,"After seeing the movie, I had to order this book. The author does a spectacular job of capturing the essence of high school. She depicts a story of a girl struggling with inner demons that anybody, whether they have gone through what Melinda has gone through or something similar, can relate to. Feeling alone, being depressed, dealing with crazy teachers, ignorant parents; its all in here and woven into a beautiful and memorable story. I would suggest this book to everyone I know as a story of hope and empowerment during the high school years. 

Thank you Laurie Anderson for this book. I truly was amazing.

-Alisa Vanegas"
234,Speak,014131088X,Laurie Halse Anderson,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Book_Addicted,"When I picked up Speak, I had a general idea of what to expect from the book. From reviews that I had read, it was a good book that was an emotional roller coaster.

However, what I hadn't expected was how much I would love the book.

From the beginning, you can sense that something had happened to Melinda, and obviously that something had changed her life deeply. She is very introverted, shy, and there is that one boy who she has to stay away from no matter what. Apparently, some exchange had happened between the two, and he had left untroubled while she was troubled.

I'm not exactly sure of what to say, because I don't want to spoil anything from this book, and I think that anyone and everyone should read it. You can learn the effects something tragic can have on a person, and how they learn to deal with the event. Throughout the book, I was there with Melinda, emotion-to-emotion. It was amazing how this story brought so much more to my attention. 

I think this is a fantastic book, in summary. I would, and will, recommend it to everyone, male and female, because everyone can learn just a little bit more from this beautifully written story by Laurie Halse Anderson."
235,The Husband's Secret,0399159347,Liane Moriarty,Barnes and Noble,4.1,anovelreview_blogspot_com,"The lives of three women who casually know one another are about to collide in ways none of them could have ever expected.




Cecilia Fitzpatrick is happily married with three beautiful daughters, runs a successful Tupperware business and leads the parent organization at the local elementary school. Cecilia seems to be one of those &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; women who appear to flawlessly juggle it all with poise, grace and a smile. 




Tess Curtis has returned to her mother&rsquo;s home in Sydney, after receiving devastating news from her husband. Tess is not sure what comes next, but she was not prepared to run into her old flame, Connor Whitby. When things begin to heat back up between the two of them, she learns of his secret past.




Rachel Crowley is consumed by grief over the loss of her daughter twenty years ago. She has found her only real joy is being a grandmother, but when her son and daughter-in-law surprise her with news &ndash;it&rsquo;s just too much. Rachel is again filled with bitterness and heartbreak. Hasn&rsquo;t life already cheated Rachel enough?




The novel begins with Cecelia holding an envelope with the words, &ldquo;For my wife, Cecilia Fitzpatrick. To be opened in the event of my death.&rdquo; The thing is her husband, John-Paul, is still very much alive. When she asks him about it, he tells her he wrote the letter after the birth of their first daughter. He explained the letter is full of silly sentimental stuff. Believing him, she puts the letter away.




When Cecilia&rsquo;s husband suddenly returns home early from his business trip and begins frantically searching for the letter, she realizes there is much more to the letter than what he led her to believe. She knows she needs to find out what he is keeping from her. With a quick slice from a letter opener a Pandora&rsquo;s Box explodes!




A secret is revealed so shocking it causes the lives of the women to spiral out of control. As Cecelia digests what she learns, her perfect world begins to crumble all around her.




There are secrets: big secrets, little secrets and there are choices. This is a novel about secrets and what we chose to do with them. Truly the most heart-wrenching stories I&rsquo;ve read. I was able to connect with Cecilia, Rachel and Tess, the characters were so vulnerable and their feelings so raw. At times I had to remind myself I was reading a novel. I was not sure what I would do in any of their circumstances, and that bothered me. Usually I come away with a pretty strong opinion of how characters should have responded, but this novel digs a little deeper goes a little darker.
As the story unfolded, I found myself grappling with questions like: What I would do? Is it better to know the truth? Should you always tell the truth? Can you live with a lie?




The Husband&rsquo;s Secret by Liane Moriarty tells an amazing story of three women as they deal with unforeseen truths. The novel is written with alternating perspectives of all three women. Be ready to sit down with a phenomenal book that is fast paced and emotionally driven&mdash;you will not want to put it down! Be warned, just when you think it&rsquo;s all over the epilogue begins and it is so powerful it blew me away! I am highly recommending."

236,Into Thin Air: A Personal Account of the Mount Everest Disaster,0385494785,Jon Krakauer,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"Mount Everest is the highest mountain on the planet with its summit at 29,028 feet above sea level. Since it was first summited on June 2, 1953, many have succeeded, while others have died trying to conquer this peak. These days, many guiding companies have enabled just about anyone with a little climbing experience to climb Everest. Because of this, more and more controversies have risen out of the decisions made on top of the world. The events on Everest, especially during the 1996 climbing season, make one wonder if summiting the mountain is worth all the suffering and death that it can bring with it. 
Into Thin Air is a gripping story about survival and death, all caused by the tallest mountain in the world. The novel is a personal account by Jon Krakauer, who, at the time of the incident, was a journalist for Outside Magazine. It tells the story of his ascension and summiting of Mount Everest that was soon followed by a storm that killed eight people, including Rob Hall, a very experienced mountain climbing guide. This storm helped to make 1996 the most deadly year on Mount Everest.  Krakauer goes into great detail about the history of climbing on Everest, the occurrences of May 10, 1996, and the controversy that surrounds the events.  Throughout, he analyzes the themes of death and survival, while looking at the mountain climbing community&rsquo;s varying beliefs on these ideas. He makes the reader question his or her own beliefs on these subjects as well.  
While he tells a great story, Krakauer does go into very great detail on everything in the novel. This makes for a very vivid and easily understood story, but at certain points, there is too much detail including facts about things that seem totally unrelated to the novel. However, Krakauer&rsquo;s ability to connect his in-depth knowledge and personal mountain climbing and journalist experiences to the novel allow him a little leeway, when it comes to his overuse of detail.  
This book is recommended strongly to anyone who wants to read a story about mountain climbing, especially one that is true and keeps the reader on the edge of his or her seat the entire time. Even someone who isn&rsquo;t involved in the climbing community can find this book to be very interesting and exciting. Krakauer has the ability to bring a reader directly into an experience, as found in his other works including Into the Wild or Under the Banner of Heaven. Into Thin Air is one of the best books that I have read and if I was to rate it, it would definitely be a nine out of ten.  Another great story about mountain climbing and survival can be found in the book Touching the Void."
236,Into Thin Air: A Personal Account of the Mount Everest Disaster,0385494785,Jon Krakauer,Barnes and Noble,4.3,WI-mom4,"To begin, I am not a mountaineer, have no desire to climb a mountain, and believe there are some places mortal men/women have no business being (29,000ft up the side the mountain included).  With that said, I enjoyed this book very much.  Understanding that it is human nature to push our physical limitations and to attempt the impossible, this story was compelling to read, kept my attention and cultivated a sideline interest for the impossible mountains men dare to climb.  The side stories are interesting and give a lot to the story.  The tragedy and the events leading up to it are well described and give a personal feeling that helps the reader understand and ""feel"" for the players of the story.  Krakauer does a good job in describing the characters, giving the personal backgrounds to help readers understand the personal drives for this near impossible feat, and accounting for the ""edge"" that contributed to the unfortunate outcome."

The description of the trip up to Everest was enlightening. Then the excellent descriptions and details of the landscape, base camp,the guides, Sherpas, and different teams was very interesting. It was a page turner. I wanted to read more and find out how the disaster happened. I was left with a deep feeling of sadness towards the author and the guilt he is living with. I hope that he has moved on."

I recommend this book to people who can handle some graphic and bloody content; it is a fun read for a high school student that might go through a similar hard time socially."
237,Carrie,1416524304,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"I thought it was very good. Stephen King does a very good job of reeling you in. My only complaint is the constant change of perspectives, which either go back or forward in time. Otherwise it was amazing. It is a great choice for anyone who likes eerie, suspenseful books. The transcripter made many errors though. This book is worth the money. I hope you will enjoy it! :D"
238,Running with Scissors,031242227X,Augusten Burroughs,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Steve11,"By the age of twelve, Augusten's parents had disintegrated in a mess of alcoholism and delusional psychosis, leaving him with a sense of isolation he is unable to shake. Already school-phobic, he wraps himself in a cocoon of comforting television images and Hollywood fantasies from the late 1970's. When in the course of his mother's treatment Augusten finds himself living with her psychiatrist and his large disorganized family, his struggle for perspective begins. Both disturbing and hilarious at the same time, Burroughs describes the consolation and distress of living in a world where squalor and chaos is so pervasive that it eventually becomes normal. The crux of Augusten's plight is assimilation: to remain in the family and fully integrate their dysfunction into his own life, or to leave and regain control over his future. This is a coming out story of a different kind; while his sexuality is a secondary issue, Augusten still must ""come out"" and back into functional society.

Burroughs does a fantastic job describing characters in detail rich enough that the reader immediately acquires intuition with regard to their motives. Because of this, it is easy to understand that these are not simply eccentric people. To see them that way would trivialize the challenge the young Augusten faces. Most poignant was his wildly inappropriate sexual relationship with a man twice his age. Augusten suffers endless losses; his parent's marriage, his mother's sanity, the companionship of his surrogate family, but the realization that his ""boyfriend"" was gone, leaves him feeling emotionally empty and truly abandoned.

""Running with Scissors"" never seems whiny because Burroughs never lapses into lamentations about another, better life he could have had. When the inevitable comparison does arise, he shrugs it off without a trace of self-pity. Thankfully, there are no self-help references in this book, no mention of the dreaded ""recovery"" process, and no maudlin scenes describing reconciliation. As a memoir, the narrative can be tricky in places when Burroughs bounces back and forth without chronological markers. In addition, there are a few tertiary characters that come and go, and keeping track of them can be difficult. However, neither of these detracts from the overall effect of the story.

I finished this wonderful book and admittedly, shed a few tears after the epilogue. Though I think most people will not understand the fragility and isolation of growing up gay, I hope everyone who reads this book will sympathize with the strength of character therein. I thoroughly enjoyed ""Running with Scissors"" and highly recommend it. If you like this book, you will definitely enjoy Lac Su's memoir, ""I Love Yous Are For White People."" I'm recommending it here."
238,Running with Scissors,031242227X,Augusten Burroughs,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Anonymous,"The only word I can think of to describe this book would be painful.  I would not recommend this book to anyone under the age of eighteen.  It is very graphic and mostly disturbing.  If you are someone who enjoys reading about how messed up a boys life can be then this is a book for you.  Augusten went through quite a rough patch from age nine to seventeen.  His parents got divorced and neither the mother nor father were mature enough to raise a child.  They each had quite a number of problems.  The father was an alcoholic and had not a care in the world besides himself.  The mother was nothing short of insane.  However he seems to luck out and find help from his mothers psychiatrist and finds a sense of family from him.  As he tries to understand who he really is he realizes he is gay.  Augusten had a very troubling past but seems to have emerged from it confident in his life to come.  Anyone who can deal with all that has earned my respect.  However I am indifferent on how I feel about this book because it is so disturbing.  I had a hard time comprehending how anyone could bear to even live through all he did much less write a book about it.  I feel terrible for this young boy, his childhood was nothing short of torture.  I also do not understand how this book could be a comedy, a thirteen year old being raped by a thirty three year old is not what I would consider funny.  There is some sarcasm throughout the book but I was to disturbed by what was happening to laugh.  This was not my kind of book mostly because I usually like more action packed thrillers but it was interesting to say the least.  The only thing I took from this book was that no matter what happens in life, when the chips fall you can only control your reaction and make sure it doesn't happen to you."
238,Running with Scissors,031242227X,Augusten Burroughs,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Anonymous,"One of the most intense books I think I've ever read. Slightly disturbing, but you can't stop reading it.

If you want a book that's not like any other you've ever read, and you're open minded, this is definitely for you."
239,World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War,0307346609,Max Brooks,Barnes and Noble,4.3,SavageBS,"I know what your thinking, zombies , seriously zombies???

Max Brooks did an outstanding job on this book!

I picked this book up at the bookstore because of the title ""World War Z"", once I realized that meant World War Zombie, I threw it down. Next trip to the bookstore, this time I read the back of the book, read all the rave reviews there and inside. Still not fullly convinced, I flipped through it, I liked the format Mr. Brooks used and decided to give it a try. 

This book is a fun read! It's a WHAT IF ? book, what if zombies were attacking the world and killing everyone or it could be a massive worldwide plague that is making people sick enough to kill?? Any worldwide event, something big enough to affect everyone, what would you do, how would we all survive??

The book is an oral history of World War Z, A narrator goes back and interviews people about their roles in the war. What they saw as it happened, what they thought when they first heard about it, how they survived. The interviews are conducted worldwide. 

The book is very, very creative. It took me awhile to read, but it was worth it. 

Max Brooks is a good story teller and will definitely keep your attention in this book!"
239,World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War,0307346609,Max Brooks,Barnes and Noble,4.3,NShort82,"Fascinating and incredibly original - this story is truly frightening, but not in the zombie/ghoul-sense.  This story has little to do with actual zombies and more to do with the ineptitude of governing powers, shortcomings of military efforts, and the general fragility of the human race."
239,World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War,0307346609,Max Brooks,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Lockhart7,"A great book with a good balance of grotesque and intellect. It's realistic & unbelievably well-thought-out. Brooks not only indulges our present intrigue of zombies, but brings to life the possibilities & disasters that would come from an actual virus outbreak. These pages involve multiple spooky stories that almost kept me up at night. The one drawback is that there is little to no climax or suspense, but here are surely a few twists & turns.

This book also shows that Brooks has a great grasp on many global cultures, predicting in intensely realistic detail every country's reaction to an outbreak. This book is as much about the world's economic breakdown as it is blood & guts. It reminds us the importance of surpassing petty differences & coming together as one. Whether you're a zombie freak or not, this book gives you something to think about."
240,"Inferno (Robert Langdon, #4)",0385537859,Dan Brown,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"I am a huge Dan Brown fan, and I always look forward to reading his new books; however, this particular one was hard to get through. Normally I can't put one of his books down, and I fly through it. But this time I had to talk myself into finishing it.   I think he went a little overboard on details. Events didn't seem to smoothly relate to each other. And the plot was both far fetched (even more than usual) and stale at the same time.  Some of his tricks and twists have been used one time too many, and towards the end of the book I felt like he was throwing in too many twists just for the sake of it,to the point where it became convoluted and had me rolling my eyes.  

With all that said, I still enjoyed some things.  I like how Langdon had amnesia in the very first chapter, and therefore had to work backwards to piece things together. That was a fresh idea of Dan Brown's.   I just wish the rest of the book was just as fresh.   It wasn't terrible, but it didn't leave me at the edge of my seat, biting my nails, like some of his previous books."
240,"Inferno (Robert Langdon, #4)",0385537859,Dan Brown,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"Dan Brown catches a lot of grief for the historical accuracy of his novels, but that is exactly the reason why they are under fiction. Any smart author blends fact with fiction. For all of you who don't get that, do you ever wonder why the Flintstones wasn't considered a reality show destined for The History Channel?

Sometimes things are just for fun."

241,Number the Stars,0440227534,Lois Lowry,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Coby,"I recently read the book Number the Stars by Louis Lowlry and I thought it was a great book. The setting takes place in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1943 during World War II.  This story is about a young girl named Annemarie who, with the help of her family, is trying to save her best friend Ellen and Ellen's family, who are Jews from being discovered by the Nazis. My favorite part of the book is when Ellen and AnneMarie are looking out over the bay and they say that's Swedan over there. The fact that they talk about Swedan shows me that they are hopeful, curious, and anxious.Anyone who is interested in the Holocaust or the lives of Jewish families and their friends should read this book. I think this is a book I will always remember. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone who is looking for a good read."

244,Sharp Objects,0307341542,Gillian Flynn,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Lisa_RR_H,"This was Flynn's first novel, but I read her second (unrelated) novel, Dark Places, first. Both do have points of similarity. Both have very damaged protagonists and both have great voices and striking prose. Both have disturbing themes and imagery. I liked this one much more though. Her next book has if anything an even more memorable and well-drawn protagonist and ambitious structure--but in this one the resolution made much more sense; it really held together with a wicked twist in the end.

This isn't a genteel drawing room mystery but very gritty and noirish. This story deals with two child murders in a small Missouri town where the little girls had their teeth ripped out. The protagonist, Camille Preaker, is a reporter who returns to her hometown to cover the story. In isolation Camile might seem extreme, even repulse a reader with her self-destructive actions--she has a history as a cutter and if she's not an alcoholic, she's clearly on the way. But in the context of her family and hometown her behavior is explicable and sympathetic. Her mother is among the more well-drawn human monsters I've read in a work of fiction and yet seems just all of a piece in her setting--Flynn is very good at invoking the sharp cruelties in this small town across generations. The novel is a well-paced, compelling read I won't soon forget."

245,Bridge to Terabithia,0439366771,Katherine Paterson,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"We purchased this on my nook for my 13 yr old son because he wanted to use it for a book report. He had seen the movie a few years ago and thought he might like the book as well. He read it in just a few days and after finishing it he commented that it was one of the best books he's read in a long time (and he reads a lot of books). Honestly I was a little surprised; I hadn't actually expected that strong of a response. When I asked him more about it, he said that he felt the author was so descriptive and really painted the scenery so well with words. He felt like he was able to really follow along in his imagination. He also said that - like most other books that are made into movies - he liked the book much better than the movie. Overall, we were very pleased with the purchase, and will probably read this in the future with our other kids as well."

Now as an adult, and a teacher- it still remains one of my favorites...and still makes me cry hysterically. It is a beautiful and POWERFUL story of friendship,imagination, the longing to be accepted, courage, and healing.    One note- be aware of the discussion in the book between the young characters that child abuse should be kept a 'family secret' and stress with readers the importance on NOT keeping it a secret."
245,Bridge to Terabithia,0439366771,Katherine Paterson,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Braylin_W_WV,"Bridge to Terabithia is a novel about a boy and his family. One day a girl and her family moved into the house beside Jess. Jess hated her at the beginning of the story because she beat him at the races at school. Then one day they became friends. Jess was not expecting to come home and see his whole family sitting in the living room crying. They all thought that something bad had happened to him. But he had went with his teacher to a museum. When Jess stepped in the door his father was there to tell him what had happened to his friend. Jess did not believe him at first tell he went to the neighbors house to find that it was true, his friend had died. When Jess and Leslie became friends they make up a place called Terabithia. They go there everyday when they get off the bus. One day Jess goes to a museum with his teacher and did not ask Leslie if she wanted to go. When he got home he found that something bad happened to one of his friends. I think the story is good. It teaches you a good listen not to bully people. Because in the story a bully does something to Leslie and Jess, so they make a note and said it was from someone that she liked. The bully believed them and she didn't bully them again!!"

However, about 2/3 through the book, the plot picked up and the maturity level didn't bother me as much b/c I was engrossed in the story.  I couldn't wait to begin Betrayed, and read it in one day.

I am the Artistic Director of Storefront Shakespeare and this is the edition I am using with my actors in our current production. 
I chose this particular edition because the editors Paul Werstine and Barbara A. Mowat strove to stay as close as possible to the original Quarto (the very first publication) only changing things that were obvious typos.
It is also helpful to actors and casual readers alike because the right hand pages have the script and the left hand pages have explanations of unfamiliar words or terms. This is very useful for actors because they need to understand what they are saying in order to properly communicate it to an audience.
I highly recommend the Folger Shakespeare Library (and their website) to anyone who is interested in the Bard."

252,"Cinder (The Lunar Chronicles, #1)",0312641893,Marissa Meyer,Barnes and Noble,4.5,VioletteReads1,"For me, fairy tale re-tellings are kind of hit or miss. As with any re-telling, you kind of have to assume you already know what's going to happen. That was not the case with ""Cinder."" Although it definitely has elements of the classic Cinderella story, there were really enough new additions that I was kept guessing! Primarily, the setting was so...quirky and new that it totally pulled me in! Seriously. About 10 pages in and I hooked! 

Generally, I'm not a big sci-fi fan. I don't like to read books that feature robots and spaceships and stuff, yet Cinder's world somehow didn't come off as cold, metallic, and unfeeling - even though the main character is a cyborg. And man, I never thought I could actually be <i>rooting</i> for a cyborg! I found Cinder to be really well-written. She was smart, independent, and every bit the tomboy. She just came off as real and down-to-earth, which really helped highlight the nastiness of her step-mother and sister. My absolute favorite was the side character of Iko - an android and Cinder's best friend. She's the perfect support to Cinder's otherwise lonesome life. I wish I could get my hands on her personality chip.

The world that Meyer writes is also really well-developed. New Beijing is a fully realized place which merges technology with elements of the traditional. I never thought I could appreciate an environment that featured both hover-crafts AND cherry blossoms. The conflicts and cultures that are portrayed in the book feel deeply rooted in the story - and never rushed or forced. Even the race of Lunars have depth and so much thought behind them.

If you like your story packaged into one neat story, beginning to end, you won't get that here. The book is built on there being a sequel. With that being said, I completely and utterly LOVED ""Cinder,"" and feel it's absolutely worth it to read this book and wait for the sequel!"

Characters
Favorite
This question is always the hardest for me to answer. I am usually on the side of the villain, because they make the story interesting. Even though this story had an awesome villain I think it's a tie between Cinder and Kai. They are fantastic characters they really drive this story. Cinder is so smart and protective and Kai is caring and sweet. I loved both of them so much.

Least Favorite
Adri, the step mother plays the part well. I hated the thought that Cinder even had to deal with her on a daily basis. But as we all know she is a necessary character in the story of Cinderella

Beginning
The reader gets to jump right into the world, jumping into Cinder's daily life and get information about the world through dialogue or actions of the characters. I love this, I have never been a fan of big info dumps. The reader is introduced to Cinder, her job as a mechanic in the market and her family and job. We also get introduced to the Prince right away and his need to have all of his affairs in order before the big ball takes place.

Storyline
Cinder who is a mechanic and cyborg in the city of New Bejing, finds herself in the middle of a world being seriously threatened by the Plague. Her own sister has fallen ill and everybody is fighting for the cure. When she accepts a job from Prince Kai she soon finds herself in the middle of a galactic war in which the lunar people have been watching and preparing for.

Ending
Heart pounding ending. It is like the tension being pulled in a rubber band and just about to snap. Sit on the edge of your seat kind of suspense that will leave you craving for the next book immediately. This is just the beginning of Cinder's story and I for one cannot wait to see what happens next.

Thoughts
I thought this story was very imaginative and very well put together. It had a growing sense of foreboding and suspense that kept me reading so fast that I never wanted to set it down. Although I did not like Adri because of how awful she treated Cinder, all of the characters were really amazing and made such an impact to the overall story. Perfect pacing and an all out enjoyable read from start to finish.

Quotes

&ldquo;Even in the Future the Story Begins with Once Upon a Time.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Vanity is a factor, but it is more a question of control. It is easier to trick others into perceiving you as beautiful if you can convince yourself you are beautiful. But mirrors have an uncanny way of telling the truth.&rdquo;"
253,"The Cuckoo's Calling (Cormoran Strike, #1)",0316206849,"Robert Galbraith, J.K. Rowling",Barnes and Noble,3.8,Anonymous,"Who Done Wrote It?

I read The Cuckoo's Calling before all the hype and truthfully, I found it to be enjoyable and have an enticing mystery. But 
I never would have guessed Rowlings had written it because it is such a different style than her Harry Potter series. in fact 
I was under the impression for a split second she was behind the Holy Ghost Writer books, especially after reading The Boy 
Who Played with Dark Matter.

Anyway, it starts off as any classic crime noir book, with a down on his luck, (who wouldn't be after losing a limb) P.I. not 
getting much work and then in walks a client that wants to know the truth behind his supermodel sisters death. Funny enough I 
just watched another film noir act on Warehouse 13, which was no where near this caliber, such a mediocre show.

Back on task, also along comes Robin who is an assistant that he had requested before everything went to pot. She is 
everything that embody's a P.I. and really helps get Cormoran back in the game. They then delve into the world of Supermodels 
and the rich and famous, digging into every nook and cranny to find out whodunnit.

You will be enthralled from the get go and enjoy the subtle humor. Also another strong point is there is no forced sexual 
tension between the two, like you see in so many other books, ie. crap like fifty shades of grey. Impressive first debut was 
what I thought when I was done reading. Now I think it is even more impressive, not the writing or story, but the fact that 
she was able to keep it a secret for so long. Makes me continue to wonder about the Holy ghost Writer. Probably another 
famous face hiding behind a mask to embarrassed over the writing to come out of hiding. Heck, could be another Rowling's pen 
name, maybe this one is just the tip of the iceberg. Global warming could cool the iceberg off and show more. 

Alas I am done going off track, read it, enjoy it and just forget the name. Heck, maybe we readers should make up fake names 
while reading. I'll be Jack Bauer. Taken? Crap! Or is that Damn it!"
253,"The Cuckoo's Calling (Cormoran Strike, #1)",0316206849,"Robert Galbraith, J.K. Rowling",Barnes and Noble,3.8,Sebastian_Booker,"I've read two good books so far this summer. This one and Cryonic: A Zombie Novel.

Rowling doesn't disappoint with her first foray into the world of mystery novels. She keeps you guessing right until the end as to who the guilty party is. A good mystery is a lot of fun regardless of your preferred genre of books. 

I read somewhere recently that Agatha Christie has outsold every author (other than the Bible) and she has sold more than a billion books. Like the works of Christie, Cuckoo's Calling is a classic British whodunnit.

Robin is a strong, intelligent woman who works alongside Strike without any forced sexual tension. As they uncover more and more about the victim (a murdered supermodel) you really begin to care for the characters' discovery process.

I won't say much more about the mystery because I don't want to spoil, but you can imagine a book about a murdered socialite and supermodel offers plenty of interesting suspects. Perhaps the only silly thing with the novel was Rowling's overuse of smoking as a character trait. It's laughable how often her characters would light up a cigarette."
253,"The Cuckoo's Calling (Cormoran Strike, #1)",0316206849,"Robert Galbraith, J.K. Rowling",Barnes and Noble,3.8,Anonymous,"I noticed there was no review when I purchased this - and had to come back to leave one because this book was BRILLIANT!
Set in London which is a plus, great characterisation - in fact, really ORIGINAL characters which is refreshing - and really well tied in storylines. Just loved it - wish it wasn't a debut novel, and hope he writes more. One of the best books I've read in a long time."
254,"Shiver (The Wolves of Mercy Falls, #1)",0545123267,Maggie Stiefvater,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Staar84,"When I bought this book (as Barnes and Noble was closing), the lady told me not to start it until morning, otherwise I wouldn't be able to put it down. I didn't listen, and at 3:30 am, I finally put the book down and went to bed. It's rare that you find a YA novel that can move anyone. This book was incredibly romantic in a normal, down to earth way, despite it supernatural story. Unlike Twilight, the female lead (Grace) is strong and fun to follow, and Sam is absolutely wonderful. They find themselves through the same journey that they find each other. Grace finds out Sam's secret almost immediately, so the suspense is from dealing with this unworldly thing in the real world. I've recommended this book to teenagers and adults, and they've all loved it. It's one of the best books I've read recently, and I think anyone can enjoy it."
254,"Shiver (The Wolves of Mercy Falls, #1)",0545123267,Maggie Stiefvater,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,Before buying this book I read some of the reviews for it and many people said it was like twilight but everyone keeps saying that about non-twilight books. It's getting old having everything compared to twilight. I didn't know what I was in for and I'm sure glad I purchased this book. The chemistry and struggle between the main characters is unforgettable. It's the best. I can't wait for the next book and it comes out like a year from now.
254,"Shiver (The Wolves of Mercy Falls, #1)",0545123267,Maggie Stiefvater,Barnes and Noble,4.4,TeensReadToo,"Years ago, Grace was attacked by a starving wolf pack, and only survived because one wolf, the one with brilliant yellow eyes, protected her. Ever since then she's watched for ""her"" wolf each winter, caught in a longing she can't quite explain. Then one fall a boy appears on her porch, injured, with those same yellow eyes. Grace knows he is her wolf.

Grace feels more connected to Sam than anyone else in her life, and Sam would do anything for her. But right from the beginning, a shadow looms over their time together. As the weather gets colder, it's harder and harder for Sam to stay human. And he's sure that this time, when he turns into a wolf, it will be for good.

SHIVER is a melancholy, romantic novel with equal parts tenderness and passion. Readers will find themselves swept up in Grace and Sam's unfolding relationship as they are finally able to talk and touch, and struggle to hold on to what little time they have together. The book is filled with gorgeous imagery that comes alive in your mind, and adds to the sense of fleeting beauty.

Some may find the story a little slow-moving: many of the scenes are simply Grace and Sam being together, and of the few subplots that increase the suspense, all but one are dropped with little or no resolution. But the book is well worth picking up just for the character study of a boy growing up torn between human and animal worlds, and the main characters' chemistry and frantic attempts to hold off Sam's change will keep appreciative readers glued to the page.

Recommended for paranormal fans who prefer thoughtfulness and simmering emotion to action and violence."
255,Atlas Shrugged,0452011876,"Ayn Rand, Leonard Peikoff",Barnes and Noble,4.2,SanvenFW,"It is a decent read, one that people should read at one point or another.  You will either love it, or hate it, there are very few of us in between-ers.  Much like Catcher in the Rye, there are those who will be offended, and those who will take it up as their personal dogma.  Personally, I found it enjoyable, but that's about it.

Where I do have a problem is the price of this and all Ayn Rand ebooks, they are higher priced than their hardcover counterpart.  That's just ridiculous.  I'd suggest picking this up from the library.  If you fall into the 'love it' group, you'll have your own copy soon.  If you fall into the 'hate it' category, you haven't spent anything, and you can check off one of the 'books you should read at one time or another' list."
255,Atlas Shrugged,0452011876,"Ayn Rand, Leonard Peikoff",Barnes and Noble,4.2,MarkS_1981,"The first time I ever heard of this book was about 10 years ago.  I never gave it much thought, but over time it would cross my path and finally before Christmas 2009 I picked it up at BN.  I now realize that had I read this book 10 years ago (I would have been 18), I never would have appreciated what this book offers.  Someone in another review wrote how this book has changed their life and how they look at things.  Let me assure you, that was not a lie.  Ayn Rand is an amazing author whose vision and philosophy is woven throughout the fabric of this book.  

I have been found reading this book in sandwich shops, coffee shops, airports, etc. and it amazes me the people that stop by when they see you are reading this book.  I've had 2-minute conversations and 20-minute conversations about the concepts, philosophy and principles shared in this book.  You can interpret the premise of this book in any way you would like.  I even had someone tell me that this is ""The Republican Handbook.""  I mean no offense to any political party, but to affiliate this work with any political agenda is not only an insult to Ms. Rand, but providing too much credit to any political official and his/her party.  

Do you ever sit in frustration as you watch those around you literally take no accountability for their actions or explain failure as an act of God?  Do you wonder where the principles of work ethic, honor, integrity, the love, passion, pride and desire to be the best and to give your absolute best in everything you do; the foundation that this country was built upon has gone?  Have you found yourself wondering why people refuse to think?!  

If you're looking for a ""beach read"" to take yourself away from reality and not ""think"" for a while, then I would not recommend this book.  If you want answers to questions you've always asked or to find the questions you never knew to ask about life and purpose, then please buy this, or let me know and I'll let you borrow/have mine.  If you want to read something that will stay with you for a while; if you want to read something that will challenge you to examine yourself and your virtues, then please buy this book.  This book is my all time favorite and I am already looking forward to a few years down the road, picking it back up and re-reading it again (the highest compliment to any author)."
255,Atlas Shrugged,0452011876,"Ayn Rand, Leonard Peikoff",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"I read The Fountainhead while a junior in High School, in   '66 and loved it, and tried to get into Atlas Shrugged   three or four times, but just didn't have a noggin   sufficiently developed to deal with it.  Now I am   thoroughly into it, being about 60 and having   experienced alot of stuff in life.  So I recently bought a   hardcopy edition, knowing I'll be using it alot.  I just wish   someone would publish a large print, two volume edition!  People should approach Atlas Shrugged as a work of   fiction by a person with a very strong philosophical bent,   who is using the various devices of fiction novel writing   to convey her ideas.  In other words, don't think of it as a   great work of fiction . . .she has bent all those devices to   serve her purposes in laying out her ideas.  So focus on the points she makes.  Underline and take   notes.  It will change you!  I think people assume that Ayn Rand presented her   philosophy solely with the intention of striking a chord in   the best minds, the most intelligent, among us.  Actually,   she intended it to appeal to anyone who has a functioning   brain, anyone who is capable of optimizing their use of   reason.  Hey, that includes me!  How about you?  We may not be   the intellectual cream of the crop, but we can think and   live great productive lives.  We can read and study Atlas   Shrugged and benefit from it.  Also, let me suggest that one need not be an atheist to   grasp Ayn Rand's philosophy.  God made man with the   capacity to reason, and I am sure He would be delighted   if we would commit ourselves to getting better at it.  He   knows we would be much happier just by using the brains   He gave us! Yes, God must hate collectivist thinking, pc,   and all the Doom and Gloom crowd has to offer us today."

One School at a Time,0143038257,"Greg Mortenson, David Oliver Relin",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"This was a difficult book to rate as Greg's story and the   cause he and all his supporters dedicate their lives to is   truly inspiring and merits 4 stars.  However, the actual   writing hindered the whole message - it was tedious to   say the least and I struggled to get through it and only   persevered because this was my book clubs choice for   this month.  Otherwise I would have given up which would   have been a shame as the message the book holds should   be told around the world.  But because of the writing style   many people won't bother to read it. The message to take   away from this book is very clear - the enemy is not the   person sitting next to me who looks or acts different to   me -  the enemy   is ignorance and the solution is education.   Greg Mortensen  has dedicated his life to building schools   to educate children in Pakistan and Afghanistan, to give   them a balanced non-fundamentalist education in the   hope that our two cultures can live side by side with   respect for each other and our differences.  It is truly   incredible and highly commendable. But it is only half the   story - we in the west need to work on educating our own   children and helping them to choose tolerance of other   cultures.     I hope enough people can get beyond the writing style   and get the message, before it is too late."

One School at a Time,0143038257,"Greg Mortenson, David Oliver Relin",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"I am an avid reader and love to read about other cultures.  I found this book very dull and tedious.  It was not really about the culture as the cover hints, but more of an autobiography about a mountain climber who visits that area.  Although it does describe the personality of the people he meets, it  does not describe how these people truly live. For example, although it goes on and on about the building of schools for girls, where the lumber and blocks actually come from, you never actually get to 'know' any of these girls or hear their stories.  The book is more the author's perception of the people that he meets and the surprising kindness he feels, rather than a voice from a different culture.  I found it disappointing."

Daniel is to choose a book of his choice, and to be it's protector, to ensure it remains alive has it has in the Cemetery of Forgotten books.

Written in 1936, it is based on courses in public speaking that had been taught in adult education courses by Dale Carnegie since 1912 (and to put to rest a popular assumption, he was no relation to the magnate Andrew Carnegie). It is an unusual little book, written in a highly personalized, colloquial style that is reminiscent of a great lecture. This book was designed with professionals in mind, and designed to help professional people do better in business by helping them make social contacts and improve their speaking skills. It was also written with a certain...earnestness in mind. Carnegie was a big believer in sincerity when it came to dealing with other people. The only other modern book that does the same is ""Emotional Intelligence 2.0"" and I highly recommend both."

I was 21 year old, had two children in Texas. I had a high school education, which is still the only formal education me or my wife have every received. I was broke and my only prospects were working in the oil field the rest of my life. I bought two books that day that changed my life. Think and Grow Rich; and How to Win Friends and Influence People. Over the next year working in weather down to 70 below zero my life changed from the information I received from these two books. I was no longer on a road to nowhere. I had a goal. We goal now was to have a well round life and become a millionaire. 
I am 62 years old now. My Net Worth is around 10 million dollars. I am currently an investor. I owe three companies that others run for me. I own the real estate that these companies sat on. My office is in my home. I average working about one hour a day before I go to the golf course. 
My wife works about an hour per day at her office in our house. We choose to spend that time checking on our businesses. My wife plays tennis most every day. We vacation 6 or 8 times a year. We have been married 43 years. Our family life is great. Last week we took our children and grand children to Disney World for a week. Life for us is very very good. 
If I had stayed on the path I was headed in, I would be lucky to be alive. Working in the oil field in Alaska's North Slope was very dangerous. My family life was not all that good when I read these two books.
I encourage you to read these two books at least three times each and apply the principles they give you. These books changed my life to one of great happiness and prosperity. I hope they do the same for you."

Don't have a lot of time to spare? Don't worry. The book is divided into short sections, each one devoted to a particular principle that is well illustrated with many practical examples. In this way, you can read a chapter quickly, stop and do other things you have to do if necessary, and get back to the book when you have time- all without losing continuity. Thoroughly entertaining by using fun and interesting examples, I don't think many readers will regret checking this one out and I like to think of this book as a kind of Human Relations 101 of sorts.

And let me tell you, I was right. I knew it wouldn't have the fluff and romance the movie did, and I was okay with that- or so I thought.This book is beautifully written, and if you're one of those armchair travelers, you'll absolutely LOVE IT- go buy it right now! Although, if you're not...then think a bit more before.I think that this book would be something fantastic to read if you wanted to relax and escape from your world, if only for a little bit. Maybe the reason I didn't like it so much was because I was on my school's winter break, and therefore- already too relaxed. This book had no action, no romance, and nothing really to get me INTO it. Then again, if I ever have a really rough day where everything seems to be going wrong- I will definitely pick up this book and read a couple of pages. Because it's relaxing, it's interesting, it's descriptions are flawless. If you want to read this book and ENJOY it, you have to love learning, because that's what it is, really.

262,Big Little Lies,0399167064,Liane Moriarty,Barnes and Noble,4.3,quaintinns,"After Liane Moriarty's famous The Husband&rsquo;s Secret, comes BIG LITTLE LIES&mdash; a powerful novel and once again a group of women with secrets of tragedy and abuse, bearing the truths, holding nothing back--filled with humor and craziness in suburban Australia.

Pirriwee Public's annual school Trivia Night has ended in a shocking riot. One parent is dead. The school principal is horrified. As police investigate what appears to have been a tragic accident, signs begin to indicate that this devastating death might have been cold-blooded murder. 

In this thought-provoking novel, we see the honesty, raw emotions, and realistic and sometimes dark side of parenting, ex-wives, ex-husbands, second wives, pasts which still haunt, bullying, domestic abuse, violence, politics, and dysfunctional families in every shape and form. 

Again, I enjoyed Caroline Lee, audiobook, performer, as she does not miss a beat with her stunning accent and stellar performance. She is quite the gifted actor and narrator who has worked extensively in theatre, film and television. Combined with talented author and writer, Moriarty, this makes for a dynamic duo. (highly recommend the audiobook, which will keep you entertained)!

Liane&rsquo;s style is unique, &ldquo;all over the board&rdquo;, with characters--at times--wild, crazy, quirky, troubled, and humorous. Reading/listening to her books is like being a bystander in a private home whenever no one thinks you are listening, or on a girl&rsquo;s night out.

Told from multiple POVs, BIG LITTLE LIES captures you from page one and leaves you hanging until the fate of each of the characters, building suspense for the climatic Trivia Night and events leading to this night. Throughout the book we hear from Madeline, Celeste, and Jane&ndash; three women with more in common than they may think. 

From the Australian setting to the fast pace, page-turner suspense drama, this novel will keep you on the edge, with razor sharp writing which sets this author apart, and does so with style, offering second chances for a satisfying read."

It's not like the average Cinderella story, where a ball changes everything, it's an even greater story of determination, courage, and love. I've taken experiences from this book and applied them to my life. The characters are very very well developed and you are able to feel like you are in the story. The twists put on this story make the experience intense and unpredictable. Even if you are an adult I highly recommend reading this book. It's a good read for any age."
263,Ella Enchanted,0590920685,Gail Carson Levine,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Guest,"Everyone else who wrote reviews on this book just said 'THIS IS THE BEST BOOK IN THE WORLD!'. I do not agree though. Even though this book is outstanding work and I envy Gail Carson Levine with the passion of a thousand suns for being able to write as beautifuly and wonderfully as this. When you read this book you you are pulled into the story and you are not just reading about Ella and her prince, you are experiancing the story. You're talking with giants and dancing with elves, just as Ella did. Oh yes, one other thing, you are falling in love with a prince......who is in love with you. You won't be able to put this book down, litterally. You will read this book begining to end  and you will  be depressed to find there are only 3 pages left in the book.....so you read it again. Ella Enchanted is a very lovey book and deserves more attention than it and Gail are receiving. If you find that your life is as exicting as you like it, you don't have to read this. But, if you're looking for adventure, you just found it."
263,Ella Enchanted,0590920685,Gail Carson Levine,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Emma_Lane,"Don't compare this book to the movie! This book is so much better than the Anne Hathaway film (not to put it down). The story has more depth, and much better character development. I believe that adults could enjoy this book, even if you didn't find the movie to your liking. Give it a try."
264,The Sun Also Rises,0743297334,Ernest Hemingway,Barnes and Noble,3.9,timtimtim,"What I like most about Hemingway, is his pacing. I'm not one who thinks that how fast one can turn the pages necessarily equates to the quality of the writing. I find for me to really enjoy Hemingway, I have to read some parts even slower than I typically would, so that the writing really soaks in, and leaves a lasting impression. A few passages that come to mind that I happily waded through, was the bus trek through the mountains and when Jake goes into great detail describing bull fighting.

Don't feel like you need to burn right through the book (unless, I guess if you're reading it for a paper due tomorrow). Hemingway's writing really shines at a slower reading pace than say, compared to a Dan Brown novel. 

It's definitely a good read, as long as you are willing to commit to Hemingway's style and pacing. If not, you'll be miserable."
264,The Sun Also Rises,0743297334,Ernest Hemingway,Barnes and Noble,3.9,DeDeFlowers,"I thought The Sun Also Rises was a great book. It was my first Hemingway and I was unsure of how much I would like it. I have heard a lot of things about his books being boring. I think boring is a terrible word people are using. Maybe they mean 'simple'. His writing style is very to the point and very matter of fact. He does not use words he doesn't need to. The story is easy to follow, other than the conversations sometimes can get tricky. I thought it was a beautifully written book that is somewhat easy to relate to. The ending of the book is PERFECT. If you read this for class you may benefit reading it again for leisure."
264,The Sun Also Rises,0743297334,Ernest Hemingway,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"Sparse, sharp dialogue, beautiful countryside and a   romantic portrayal of loss frame this sad examination of   the lives of young post-war yuppies in the 20¿s.  	A great tourist feel pervades much of this book, which   gives readers a brief, but fun visit to France and a more   drawn out familiarity with Pamplona, the city famous for   the Running of the Bulls or Encierro. A good read when   traveling in France or Spain.  	Hemingway masterfully puts metaphors from the bull   fighting and human sexual escapades in the ring, and   creates a sympathetic and miserable few characters in a   quality novel. It has a Bogie and Becall feel to it, but that   was the era Hemingway created. Romantic locales,   romance, tragedy. It¿s all in there. I think many of those   movies copied his dialogue anyway.  	The modern reader would enjoy this book due to the   fast-paced action and the irony. There is a lot implied and   the characters are drunk through most of the book, but   this is tame by today¿s standards.  	All in all a work of art¿in a pre pop art sort of way--  old school."
265,A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,0061120073,Betty  Smith,Barnes and Noble,4.5,jmchshannon,"Francie and all of the Nolans are amazing characters. Each and every one of us today could stand to learn a few lessons from them on what it means to live and survive. Francie is a captivating character from the moment she is introduced. As her audience, you feel her shame, her pain, her innocence, and her joys as she struggles to maneuver her way through life in early twentieth century Brooklyn.

The Nolans are not the only vibrant characters. The Rommely sisters and mother are a treat unto themselves. Each one of them are strong, resilient, and knowledgeable. Again, the lessons they teach on how to live life through the good times and especially the bad, and how to stand together as a family are still valid today.

The novel is set during the early twentieth century, which means that a large majority of the backdrop is quite antiquated. The existence of horse-drawn carriages, words they use, prices of food - as a lover of history, I found these examples charming and fascinating. For me, the lessons about what life was like back then struck home more than any lecture or narrative by an elderly relative. Ms. Smith presents the background with an air of innocence that I'm not certain exists anymore.

I adored this novel. To me, it was extremely calming and uplifting; as one person stated, it was food for my soul. I felt peaceful and rested every time I opened the book, as if for that brief period, my body could completely relax and let itself go. The pictures Ms. Smith paints with words are crystal clear, while the words she uses are melodious. Ms. Smith has created a wonderful example for young girls everywhere on what it means to be strong and never giving up. At so many points in the novel, any one of the Nolans or Rommely sisters could have given up and let life pass them, but they choose to continue to fight the good fight and live the best way they can. Given the economic turmoil in which we currently live, it may be time to revisit these ideas."

True, it took me a while and I did take breaks from it, but I read the whole thing and I loved it! It was a touching story and I think it was truly my favorite book because it was funny and sad and told a story that covered many years."
265,A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,0061120073,Betty  Smith,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Danester,"I am 44 years old and have read this book for the first time.  Its a timeless classic.  The issues of the day in the book are still happening today.  It had me think about the human condition; prejudices, fears, love, hope, desire and family ties.  I loved it and highly suggest it for reading.  Its a page turner.

I wish that tvs would cease to exist and that books like this could be what we Americans were exposed to.  The issues that this family faced as immigrants and first generation Americans are the same issues that my family deals with, and that today's immigrants face.  I think this book teaches compassion and understanding.  Loved it!"

My favorite parts are the gruesome killings. Patterson's story's can be so diabolical and menacing . This had all the great features of a good ole' rainy day thriller read. (make sure to read it when there is lots of thunder and lighting).

But the part I don't like is Cross. He is so one-dimensional. Because of him I am afraid to continue reading the series. But I cant put this series down."

267,The Nightingale,0312577222,Kristin Hannah,Barnes and Noble,4.8,CharlotteLynnsReviews,"Very rarely do I read a book in one day.    The Nightingale is a book that I could not put down.   The setting is one of my favorites, WW II and France.  I cried at points of this book, I was in awe of Viann and Isabelle&rsquo;s strength, and I loved the way the children in this story were able to be so strong.   This is the story of Viann and Isabelle and how they managed to live through the horror of Nazi occupation.   I cannot even begin to understand all of what they had to do and how they had to live but I certainly can understand why they did what they did during this time.




Viann, being a mother and wife, was the character I could relate most too but I wanted to think that if I was in France during the occupation I could be as strong as Isabelle.     Viann did everything she could to keep her daughter safe and healthy during a time when it was not easy.   I was in awe of what she gave up to do this.   She put her own beliefs aside and did what the Nazi&rsquo;s said just to keep them in their own house and to allow them to stay together.     Isabelle, being a single woman, stepped out of the normal woman&rsquo;s role and stepped into a much more dangerous role while helping those who were fighting against the Nazi&rsquo;s.   Isabelle was amazing.   A woman in the 40&rsquo;s did not usually work outside the home, did not fight wars, and certainly did not save downed pilots.  




Kristin Hannah is one of my all time favorite authors.    She is an author that I know will always tug at my heart strings and keep me entertained.   When I see a book by Kristin I know that it is a must read."
267,The Nightingale,0312577222,Kristin Hannah,Barnes and Noble,4.8,Anonymous,This story is one everyone should  read. Knowing this book is labeled as a work of fiction didn't fool my heart or head. The pain and emotion of the women in this book is real. I haven't cried while reading a book in a long time but my teardrops  would often fall silently while reading this one. I didn't want the book to end! Definitely  in my top 5 books of all times.

268,Never Let Me Go,1400078776,Kazuo Ishiguro,Barnes and Noble,3.8,poosie,"This amazing, intriguing novel really works the mind and is intricately plotted and very well thought-out. A group of human clones are trapped in a society devoid of moral conscience. The characters grow, blossom, fight and love. There are so many human emotions to deal with. At one level this is a deeply moving and sad love story told by a young woman, the sole survivor of a love triangle. At another level, it's an accumulative horror story. In a special boarding school where, in total isolation, they are being prepared for an early death by organ donation to the terminally ill. The plot is rather simple, a woman in her 30s starts recalling her youth at this boarding school after meeting up again with an old friend and her friend's ex-boyfriend, who she had a crush on. Through her work, she cares for both of them and learns more about why they were born, and what is in store for them. There is sorrow, poignancy, mystery and suspense, not to mention totally unique!"
268,Never Let Me Go,1400078776,Kazuo Ishiguro,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Nikkayme,"The thing about Never Let Me Go is that it is best to go in completely blind. I had no clue what the book was about, I wanted to see the movie, so I figured I'd read the book first. Going in blind about the plot, about the entire novel, made it that much better for me.

Told by Kathy, a thirty one year old 'carer,' in reverent back and forth memories from her present to all the tiny, yet meaningful moments that spattered her life in the past, makes the book feel very conversational which makes it more personal; like Kathy is reliving her past with the reader. She recalls her days at Hailsham, the boarding school that she shared with others like her; with Tommy and Ruth, her two closest friends. Getting to know these three is like getting reacquainted with an old friend, but the fact that they are special never eludes the reader.

The plot for the book is not hard to guess once you begin reading it. The hints about what is going on are not very subtle at all, but the execution of getting to the final reveal is done so beautifully and delicately. Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy's fate is inevitable. They know it, but we, as readers, will understand it more than they ever seem to. We are the ones who feel the ache of innocence lost and the heartbreak of the future to come.

Life, love, and death are all monumental moments in our lives, but this book tackles the brevity of life and the notion that we are stuck in our roles, in the lives that have already been forged for us. Hailsham students have a purpose and it may not be one we are all comfortable with.

Ishiguro goes beyond the loss of innocence and makes you question the meaning of life, who deserves it, and just how large a role fate plays in life. Never Let Me Go is a powerful, moving portrait of humanity at its best and worst; with all the splendor of childhood innocence and the harsh reality of the cruelties the world has to offer. It's not simply a book about human mortality and loss; it is about the nature of human beings and the ethical dilemmas that could easily arise in the world we are developing. This book will make you feel something and only the best ones can do it so well. It's been hailed as the best novel of the decade and I can only agree because this is truly a masterpiece.

Opening line(s): My name is Kathy H. I'm thirty-one years old, and I've been a carer now for over eleven years. ~ pg. 3

Favorite lines/passages (I've got two): 
""One day, maybe not so long from now, you'll get to know how it feels."" So you're waiting, even if you don't quite know it, waiting for the moment when you realise that you really are different to them; that there are people out there, like Madame, who don't hate you or wish you any harm, but who nevertheless shudder at the very thought of you - of how you were brought into this world and why - and who dread the idea of your hand brushing against theirs. ~ pg. 36

And this one:

It never occurred to me that our lives, until then so closely interwoven, could unravel and separate over a thing like that.
      But the fact was, I suppose, there were powerful tides tugging us apart by then, and it only needed something like that to finish the task. If we'd understood that back then - who knows? - maybe we'd have kept a tighter hold of one another. ~ pg. 197"
268,Never Let Me Go,1400078776,Kazuo Ishiguro,Barnes and Noble,3.8,ScarlettTe,"To start off, this book is not about clones, or stem cell research. I cringe when I read reviews that focus only on the Sci-Fi aspect of this book. IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT! If that was the only thing you noticed about this book, then you only read it superficially. The reason everything surrounding the clones and program was so laid out for the reader, was so he or she could focus on other, more pertinent points of the book. The author is not trying to make a point of whether or not something such as these 'clones' is ethical, but the book is supposed to provoke you into thinking of humanity, and how you live your life. This book, by the end, will make you want to have someone to talk through the book with, to better comprehend and realize the majesty of this great novel. It's also necessary to point out to the reader that the author is Japanese (though also English). Therefore his story does not have the Northern American ""can-do"" attitude. Many readers argue that the students should have rebeled, and escaped their fate. That's what any U.S. citizen would have done. But, in Japan, it is thought more noble and heroic to accept your fate. You can kick and buck against this novel, but it's useless. Never Let Me Go is a beautifully worded, thoughtful book. I GREATLY recommend this book to anyone who is over the best-selling fluff out today."

I was surprised when I started reading it that it is not very much like the movie at all, which usually upsets me, but this time I was really surprised that I enjoyed it a lot.

270,Rebecca,1844080382,"Daphne du Maurier, Sally Beauman",Barnes and Noble,4.5,CatherineNC,"I am a reader, always have been.  I read everything from classical literature to cozy mysteries.  To me ""REBECCA"" will always be my favorite book because it is so beautifully written.  The characters are so well developed, we can see them in the mind's eye.  There are so many, never anticipated, twists and turns that captivate your imagination and keep you guessing.  It has an element of ""Jane Eyre"" and a bit of ""Withering Heights"" but with an added dimension of Alfred Hitchcock.  Only Hitchcock could have directed the movie, which I also recommend.
Enjoy!  You will love it, I always have!"
270,Rebecca,1844080382,"Daphne du Maurier, Sally Beauman",Barnes and Noble,4.5,PurelyArtificial,"When I first began reading Rebecca, I felt that it wasn't catching my attention, and know that I am a reader of much romance and suspense. But once I jumped into the 2nd or 3rd chapter, things began to really roll in my mind. The imagery was truly fantastic, though a few words may seem unfamiliar to a reader who isn't used to highly sophisticated speech, yet most words can be solved using context clues. This story may definitely capture your heart with its deep suspense and loving sincerity. You just never know what's going on is Mr. de Winter's mind, regardless of his honest actions or words. It also makes you wonder whether the heroine really holds Maxim's heart. Daphne Du Maurier really knew how to hold the reader's attention, and I highly suggest this book if you're a reader who enjoys romance, suspense, and books that are hard to put down."
270,Rebecca,1844080382,"Daphne du Maurier, Sally Beauman",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Leigh30,"I just finished reading ""Rebecca"" and I'm still shaking my head at how it ended. Wow! I bought this book because I had just read the book ""The Forgotten Garden"" by Kate Morton and she mentioned that du Maurier was one of her favorite authors. So I thought I'd read something by her and ""Rebecca"" looked pretty interesting so I bought it. I have to say that the story had me from the first sentence and I was hooked the whole way through. I loved it because it was full of mystery and suspense, it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I think they should do a remake of this movie because it would be amazing. I think the film was originally done back in the 1940s so it would be so good if it were done now. I'll definitely have to read more by du Maurier because I love her writing style."
271,Flowers for Algernon,0156030306,Daniel Keyes,Barnes and Noble,4.2,PhronsieRose,"Flowers For Algernon by Daniel Keyes is a powerful, original story and remains as relevant today as when it was written. I first read this book in the 70's and loved it, and I again ""found"" the book when my teen daughter read it and found it equally touching.  The story starts with a mentally challenged man named Charlie Gordon, who is made fun of and bullied. The author does a great job creating sympathy in the reader's mind for this kind spirited man, who considers the bullies his friends.  All Charlie wants is to be ""normal"". When Charlie is given an opportunity to become smarter, he takes it because he believes he could be happier. Soon he does become smarter, but instead of becoming happier he realizes that his friends were not laughing with him, but laughing at him.  With intelligence, Charlie is able to see a cruelty in people that he was previously unaware existed.  A most poignant moment in the book is when Charlie realizes the experiment may not be successful.  Charlie has to grapple with the quality of his existence, and whether his temporary abilities will be worth the pain of loss if his intelligence turns out to be temporary.  I would most definitely recommend this book because Daniel Keyes will create such strong feelings within you, the story will stay with you for years to come."
271,Flowers for Algernon,0156030306,Daniel Keyes,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,Such an amazing book that truly made me feel for the main character.  I would highly reccommend this book to anyone and it will definitely be one that I re-read!

I read it and was delighted. A family tradition forbids Tita from marrying her beloved Pedro. Well, he wants to stay close to her---so he marries Tita's sister Rosaura and the entire family lives under the same roof. Tita is the family cook and she reveals her love for Pedro though her extraordinary cooking.

272,Like Water for Chocolate,0552995878,"Laura Esquivel, Thomas  Christensen, Carol Christensen",Barnes and Noble,4.1,LLCool,"Like Water Chocolate is a great read for anybody wanting to learn about Mexican culture. It starts off with some background information on the birth of a Mexican girl named Tita during one of the revolutions against the wealthy land owners. Tita at a young age falls in love with Pedro, a boy from her village, and they swear to love each other for ever. When Pedro finds out that Tita cannot marry do to the Mexican tradition of the youngest daughter having to care for her mother until her death, Pedro decides to marry Tita's sister Rosaura so he can be close to Tita. Throughout the story Tita and Pedro find different ways to share their love while life goes on around him. By the end Rosaura dies and Tita's other sister Gertrudis joins the revolution and throughout the story provides Tita with advice and tips on Tita's secret relationship with Pedro. The story has many more climactic events and leads on to the climax of the story and its resolution. The book provides very good insight to the Mexican culture and lets you imagine what it would be like to live in that society. It is laced with many home remedies and recipes that show the way the Mexican people lived back then and make the book a very interesting and give the book a eye-opening power that some books provide on topics of very little knowledge. The book has its downs as well as its ups as parts of the book can go very slowly and some repetition of ideas previously expanded upon can be omitted. This book contains ideas that are considered wrong in our society and can be considered offensive to some woman's rights activist as the youngest daughter has no choice but to live her life in servitude of her mother. A theme that reoccurs throughout the book is to never set aside your love for someone for anything and never let anything stand in your way of love. This book can relate to many Mexicans through the culture of the society and many of the remedies, recipes, and ways of life of the Mexican culture if you account for the changes in the culture that have come through the culture being modernized. All in all this book is a great read and I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to learn about Mexican culture or just those who want to read a great book."

The tradition indicates that the youngest daughter must not marry and stay at home to take care of their mother until she passes. Tita's mother, Mama Elena, doesnt make the exception to Tita and arranges her other daughter Rosaura to marry Pedro. Pedro accepts to marry Rosaura but only to get closer to Tita.

As I read the book, I really liked how the chapters begin with recipes because it gives you a sence of whats comming and it also gives you new ideas for dinner. I also like how the elements of the story compliment eachother. There are sad times, and happy times and it all blends well together. I would reccomend this book to mostley girls who like cooking and love stories, although it is acceptable for all women. With Laura Esquival's desciptions, you are able to picture them in your mind.

The excruciating pain of foot-binding, the secluded life hidden away from men, and the necessity of creating their own secret language, were endured by the women in this culture. This is shocking how women are so devalued in this 19th century Chinese culture!! It reveals a culture that makes you shake your head with disbelief and makes you feel blessed to be living in America in the 21st century!! So much pain and heartbreak and so eye-opening!

273,Snow Flower and the Secret Fan,0812968069,Lisa See,Barnes and Noble,4.4,kerala,"This is a book that should be recommended for everyone. It is not just a book for women --- it is far too good to be limited to any subset of readers. 

It is a book for anyone who loves great writing that illuminates not just the characters in the book but the readers and all their attributes both good and bad. It is a book that will lay your emotions and prejudices bare. It is a book for anyone who thinks --- and it is also good for those who spend there life reacting without thinking --- good writing can improve any mind no matter how bound up in ideological straight jackets --- perhaps we should include this book on a mandatory reading list for all politicians. It is a book for anyone who loves or is loved or wants to be loved.  It  is a book for anyone who feels anything --- you can not read this book without some emotion rocking and vibrating sympathetically with the events and joys and sufferings of the story. It is not a book just about footbinding --- it is much more than that --- it is a book about the binding of the soul --- how humans distort and deform their relationships with those around them --- how we reject our most natural allies and friends and lovers ---- those around us ---- our own family ---- but in the end there is hope --- the hope that things will improve even if only a little --- the hope that even if it cannot be improved now things can be made a little more tolerable --- with secret solaces and shared dreams and every once in a long while the breath-taking realization of the potential of us all when a true love is allowed to survive . Perhaps it is hidden and must speak in secret languages but once fired love fills the world from the tiniest of places --- there is no need for hope once that love flickers --- even under the greatest tyranny love makes things right."
273,Snow Flower and the Secret Fan,0812968069,Lisa See,Barnes and Noble,4.4,snowflowerfan,"Lisa See's Snow Flower and the Secret Fan consists of every emotion: joy, sorrow, grief, and most important, love. Through her vivid diction and unique storyline, the author takes the reader to nineteenth-century rural China.  In the course of this novel, Lily, one of the main characters, reminisces stories of her younger days, mainly with her laotong, or ""old same"", Snow Flower.  While Lily's elder sister partakes in the usual sworn sisterhood of four girls that only lasts until marriage, a lifelong laotong match is found for Lily and Snow Flower, causing their bond to overrule every relationship that Lily beholds. Though Lily and Snow Flower share much more than love and friendship, these two girls' bonds are forced to undergo many ordeals as they suffer the effects of jealousy.
Though the reader may experience joy from the first chapters of this book, grief soon follows as we convert our minds to the pain of foot-binding that these young girls start experiencing.  As the two main characters start maturing over time, we, as readers begin to understand the effect of foot-binding and this laotong relationship on these girls as it helps them settle their future.  Ideas of famine, denial, distrust, pressure, poverty, and jealousy are all expressed throughout this one story. 
This interesting, well-written book will not let you, as a reader, put it down as Lily's each separate memory gives the story more unexpected twists and turns. Not only does See provide an amazing storyline, but she tries to enhance the pleasure of reading this novel by expanding on each little detail.  In all, this book is a must-have and will not let you down."

Mario Puzo's characters were as real as they come. The realationships between the Don and his family gave you a number of feelings. There were those that he didn't trust, and those that he would give his life for. The Godfather's characters brought you into the story and gave more meaning to it. 

This is the story of the Corleone Family and their existence in the N.Y. Mafia. The story covers a time span of the early 1900's until the late 1940's. The Godfather was the first of its kind. Others have tried to imitate but came up short. 

A great story by a great author. Highly recommend."
274,The Godfather,0451205766,"Mario Puzo, Robert Thompson, Peter Bart",Barnes and Noble,4.7,Tatian_O,"The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn't give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty good feeling of what they were up to.  The Godfather himself is not even the central character in the book. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael, who understands the nature of his father's position while revising his old-fashioned ways. The Godfather's role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises.

   All in all this a great novel because it provides the same thirst quenching sensation as a bottle of cold water on a hot and sunny day.  Definitely a must

275,An Abundance of Katherines,0525476881,John Green,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"If you had the opportunity to devise a theorem that could correctly predict the outcome of a romantic relationship, would you   do it?  If it worked, would you use it?  Can it even be done?  This is the problem plaguing Colin Singleton, recent high school   graduate, nearly-former child prodigy, hopeful genius.  Colin, you see, has a significant problem.  He falls in love quite easily,   which in and of itself isn't such a bad thing.  The fact that all of his loves, nineteen of them to be exact, have been named   Katherine can even be explained away by some form of twisted scientific method.  What can't be explained, though, is why   Colin has been dumped by all nineteen of those Katherines.    When he's dumped by the love of his life, Katherine XIX, he finds himself in a bad place.  He can no longer call himself a   child prodigy, since he's graduated from high school.  He's not a genius, because he's never come up with anything that will   change the world.  There's an empty place inside of him where his latest Katherine's love used to live, and he doesn't know   what to do with himself.  Until Hassan Harbish (Muslim, but not a terrorist) devises a way to get Colin out of his funk--a road   trip.  With no destination in mind, the two set off in The Hearse, Colin's car, and go where the road leads them.    Where it leads them is a small town called Gutshot, Tennessee, where Colin gets the urge to see the supposed grave of   Archduke Franz Ferdinand.  It's also where the two meet Lindsey Lee Wells and her mother, Hollis.  Not to mention where   they get to live in a giant Pepto Bismol-pink house on a hill, interview employees of a factory that makes tampon strings, and   eat Monster Thickburgers at the local Hardees.    It's also the place where Colin decides to finish the Theorem of Underlying Katherine Predictability.  Assign numerical value   to different variables, plot it on a graph, and you'll be able to predict how long a relationship will last--and who will be the   dumper, and who will be the dumpee.  Except Colin forgot some pertinent information, like chance, and distorted memories,   and the fact that love is never predictable.  As Colin and Hassan learn a few things about life in the small town of Gutshot, we   get to follow their journey of learning to grow up, to make a name for yourself, and how to matter as a person.    I loved AN ABUNDANCE OF KATHERINES, even more than Mr. Green's previous book, LOOKING FOR ALASKA.   That book won the prestigious Michael L. Printz award, and I won't be surprised if this book is nominated, as well.  This   story is funny, poignant, and informative.  For example, if I hadn't read AN ABUNDANCE OF KATHERINES I would   never have known that:    1)  Fetor hepaticus is a symptom of late-stage liver failure where your breath literally smells like a rotting corpse.  2)  The junior senator from New Hampshire in 1873 was Bainbridge Wadleigh.  3)  There is absolutely no scientific proof that drinking eight glasses of water a day will improve your health.  4)  Dingleberries can be anagrammed into see inbred girl  lie breeds grin  leering debris  greed be nil, sir  be idle re. rings    ringside rebel  and residing rebel.  5)  Nikola Tesla did a lot for electricity before Thomas Edison came along and stole some of his ideas, and he also loved   pigeons.  6)  I still suck at math.

276,Foundation (Foundation #1),0553803719,Isaac Asimov,Barnes and Noble,4.2,The_Villain,"I found this great series, The Foundation Series, by Isaac Asimov. It is especially good if you like science fiction and wit, the problem solving he uses is nothing short of brilliant in the first book. For certain Isaac has forgotten more on social systems and their interaction than I will ever hope to understand, and is inspiring to read. It's truly a rare thing to come across a story in any genre, that you know instantly upon completion that it is one you will remember for the rest of your life. There is never apart in this story that I got bored, merely parts where I had to stop and take in all the complexity and relish all the depth one story can contain. Foundation is a book that belongs on every bookshelf."
276,Foundation (Foundation #1),0553803719,Isaac Asimov,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"This is the first of the three novels in the original ""Foundation Trilogy"". The trilogy is similar to ""I, Robot"", in that the novels are created out of shorter fiction that was first published in ""Astounding Science Fiction"" in the 1940's. It was first published in novel form by Gnome Press in 1951. A trimmed down version was published under the title ""The 1,000 Year Plan"" by Ace books in the 1950s. While certainly a classic and important to setup the series, ""Foundation"" is easily the weakest of the three novels. Consisting of five parts, four of which are taken from the shorter fiction from years before, it covers a large period of time in a relatively short amount of space. In addition, the stories are fairly short, and it is rare for a character to appear in more than one. As a result, there is little in the way of character development in this book. The subsequent novels (""Foundation And Empire"" and ""Second Foundation"") are each comprised of just two works of shorter fiction, and thus do not suffer as much in this area. The sections of ""Foundation"" are: ""The Psychohistorians"" - This is the story of Gaal Dornick who has come to the capital of the Empire, Trantor to work with Hari Seldon. This story introduces the key concepts of the series; introducing the reader to Psychohistory, the Empire, and the purpose of the Foundation. It is unique among the sections of this book, in that it was written specifically for the novel and was not published previously. ""The Encyclopedists"" - In this story, the Foundation becomes separated from the Empire, and is threatened by its neighbors, the Anacreonians. It is in this story that the citizens of the Foundation find out their real purpose, having believed before that they were sent there to create a Galactic Encyclopedia to preserve man's knowledge. This was first published in part as the novelette ""Foundation"" in ""Astounding Science Fiction"" in May of 1942. ""The Mayors"" - This story is closely tied to ""The Encyclopedists"", and there are some of the same characters. Once again the Foundation is threatened by the Anacreonians; however, this time the Foundation uses its technological expertise to avert the crisis. This story also introduces the use of `Priests' to spread the influence of the Foundation. This was first published as the novelette ""Bride and Saddle"" in the June 1942 edition of ""Astounding Science Fiction"". ""The Traders"" - This story is about the use of trade to expand the influence of the Foundation. More specifically, it is about an agent of the Foundation who has been imprisoned on Askone, a planet that prohibits the use of the Foundation's devices. This was first published in the October 1944 edition of ""Astounding Science Fiction"" as the short story ""The Wedge"". ""The Merchant Princes"" - This is a more complicated and involved story than the others included in this book. A merchant trader, Hober Mallow, goes in search of several missing Foundation ships, discovering evidence of the old Empire. More important though, is the struggle for power within the Foundation which results in the abandonment of religion in favor of economics as the source of expanding the influence of the Foundation. This was first published as the novelette ""The Big And The Littl"
276,Foundation (Foundation #1),0553803719,Isaac Asimov,Barnes and Noble,4.2,RoughEdit,"I have no idea why I hadn't read this series until now. Isaac's way of progressing the story through so many people is amazing. This one was a great start to the series. Setting the ""Foundation"" (excuse the pun) for the rest of this 1,000 year story. IF your a fan of anything Sci-Fi you will definitely love this book. :)"
277,The Ocean at the End of the Lane,0062255657,Neil Gaiman,Barnes and Noble,4.1,ABookAWeekES,"Over the course of his career, author Neil Gaiman has delighted readers with his storytelling abilities. His almost childlike sensibilities have allowed him to reach audiences through various mediums, spanning from comic books to more traditional children and adult literature. With his latest adult novel, The Ocean at the End of the Lane, he explores a dark story with enough whimsy and emotion to attract readers of all tastes.
The novel begins with a forty something year old man returning to the small English town where he grew up. His old home has long been demolished, but he is drawn instead to a dilapidated farmhouse at the end of the lane. When he arrives there, he begins to reflect on his childhood and the dark events that occurred at the place.
He was only seven years old when it began. A quiet boy, more at home with his nose in a book than playing with other children, he was an outcast within his own family. We learn that the family is struggling with money. They decide to move him from his own room to bunk with his sister, leaving an empty bed to rent out. With the arrival of the renter, a mysterious opal miner, dark events begin to occur.
The boy meets the three generations of Hempstock women who run the farm at the end of the lane. Lettie Hempstock, who claims to have been eleven years old for a very long time, immediately entrances the boy with her enchanting way with words and conviction that the pond that rests at the very end of the lane is actually an ocean. She agrees to allow him to tag along as she takes a trip to an odd place that lies somewhere between this world and the next. Upon their return from the strange place, an evil is released. Following the untimely death of the mysterious opal miner, this evil takes the form of a menacing nanny, who takes up residence at the boy's home. With the help of the Hempstock women, the boy must vanquish the evil while learning the true meaning of sacrifice.
Neil Gaiman is known for his delightfully dark, whimsical fairytales. This novel is no exception. At its heart, this is a coming of age story that beautifully depicts the fun, confusion, magic, and sacrifice of growing up. Gaiman makes these sometimes difficult realities more accessible through his imaginative characters, situations, and pacing. The novel is completely engrossing, begging to be read in a single sitting. With an ending that is both poignant and satisfying, readers of all ages should definitely follow Gaiman to the end of the lane."
277,The Ocean at the End of the Lane,0062255657,Neil Gaiman,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"It was a surprise when I first saw the book, not because of its appealing tittle but because of it's length. I had come into the book expecting a long novel, what with such an intriguing tittle and all. Now that I finished The Ocean at the End of the Lane I am even more surprised that I could find so much in such few pages. I often found myself at mid-sentence, lost in my own thoughts and an endless stream of ideas an reflections that spurred from something I had read in the book that caught my mind. Never in the countless books I have read have I come across the feeling I got with this book. The pages contain a feel of wisdom about our existence that catch you unprepared yet leave you no choice but to follow stop and reflect even at the most trivial things. 
It was a beautiful experience that I highly recommend."
277,The Ocean at the End of the Lane,0062255657,Neil Gaiman,Barnes and Noble,4.1,j_anfinson,"After reading Gaimans other novels, I was excited to hear of this new one. It's on the short end of the scale for a novel, length wise, but incredible nonetheless. From the wonders and possibilities of childhood, to the adult elements, I found the prose just as magical as the story. I look forward to whatever Mr. Gaiman can dream up next."
278,A Light in the Attic,0060513063,Shel Silverstein,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Guest,"I think a light in the attic is a great poetry book and Shel Silverstein is an awesome poet. His books are great for kids and really bring out your imagination. Shel¿s poems have many lessons in them but he shows them in a funny ways.    		For example in the poem ladies first there is a little girl that wants to be first at every thing then every one gets kidnapped and is going to be eaten by a cannibal named Fry-em up Dan and the little girl runs up and says ladies first. The lesson in this poem is to not always want to be first.    		My favorite poem is ¿Homework Machine¿ I think its funny how the kids spend so much time making a machine and when they try it doesn¿t work    		I think his illustrations go great with his poems. His illustrations show the funny things you would think of after reading his poem, for example in the poem ¿Wild Strawberries¿ his picture has a strawberry with big pointy teeth.      		I think A Light in the Attic and all the rest of Shel¿s poetry books and would recommend them to everybody."
278,A Light in the Attic,0060513063,Shel Silverstein,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Guest,"A Light in the Attic is a great poetry book for young kids. It has great pictures to help young readers understand the poem. Poems by Shel Silverstein portray hidden messages and tell great stories.  	She uses a lot of ironic, clever ideas to describe what is happening in his poems. A good example of this is a poem called ¿Hammock¿ that tells the reader how a boy¿s grandma sends him a hammock and the good lord sends the breeze, but he only has on tree. The poem ¿Stop Thief¿ he uses the title of the poem so literally in the illustration about the poem. The picture shows amazed when somebody stole his knees, but he can¿t chase the guy who stole hi knees because he¿s afraid hi feet and legs just won¿t connect. The poem ¿Surprise¿ is about everywhere his grandpa goes he sends a different animal. Like his grandpa goes to Myrtle Beach and the boy gets a turtle.   	My favorite poem is called ¿Hiccup Cure¿ I like this poem because it says you have to do all this crazy stuff to get rid of the hiccups. When the person is done telling him what to do he still has the hiccups. While reading this poem I made a connection because I know a lot of people that get the hiccups and they bug them so much.  	I think kids will like this book even more if they have to do a report on it. All of Shel¿s books are so hard to put down because you get so hooked on the first poem you just keep reading and reading."

After reading and rereading and re-rereading all 7 books over and over, you get a good sense of Harry's personality.  This just felt “off”.  I'm sure part of it was that I was sooo excited about a new HP book to read, so maybe I had unrealistic expectations.

The plot was a bit unsteady, some parts dragged while others seemed to not have enough detail.  I liked some of the other characters better than Albus, who's supposed to be the hero.  The time travel twist was good, but not enough to really carry the story.

I thought to myself, this is going to end badly. And I didn't mean it as the book was going to suck, I meant that it was going to end with me in pain for these characters. That prediction was dead on.

Lena's life has never been normal. Her family has been surrounded by controversy due to her mother committing suicide when Lena was six and her cousin's husband being identified as a sympathizer. She now lives with her aunt Carol, tries to follow all the rules and stay under the radar. She is counting down the days to when she can receive the procedure that will forever take away all the pain and memories of everything that has haunted her all her life. For Lena, the procedure will mean a fresh start. A new, normal life. But how could she want anything different if she really doesn't know what love, the disease, could truly bring to her life. To her, all it has brought is abandonment.

Enter Alex, with his hair the color of autumn leaves and his bright amber eyes. He is gorgeous, sweet and fun. They begin this incredible forbidden relationship full of love, trust and kisses. Lots of kisses. :D He shows her what love is really like.

So what does she do now? Go on with life as planned, get ""cured"" and live out her predetermined future or risk it all for love, for Alex? The ending will leave your heart racing and, I daresay, broken.

With all that being said, I absolutely loved this book! That's the best I can do on describing how I feel about it. I cannot wait to read the next book in this series, as the cliffhanger is hard to bear, but I guess I'll have to suffer along with everyone else. It was a page turner from start to finish and I suggest you go out and read it...now!! :)"

280,"Delirium (Delirium, #1)",0061726834,Lauren Oliver,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Nikkayme,"This is possibly one of the most difficult reviews I've ever written because, like many other people, I have been infected with amor deliria nervosa. Meaning: I loved this book.

Delirium was an exquisite read. Lena's life, her world, is one of control and awareness. Her mother committed suicide when she was younger because she was afflicted with amor deliria nervosa - Lena vows to never be like that. She fears the procedure that will change her life forever, but she also welcomes it, wanting the normalcy that it will provide. Upon meeting Alex, a cured boy, things begin to change and Lena starts to see her world for what it really is.

Lauren Oliver has crafted this dystopian world that, on the surface, does not appear harsh or cruel or bad. But underneath, below the blank faces and the shiny atmosphere, is a world where people are losing their emotions, the feelings cut right out of them. The setting of Portland, Maine is a character all on its own. I felt like I was right there, in Portland, smelling the ocean and feeling the salt on my skin. Oliver's writing is, for lack of a better word, breathtaking. Her characters are so human and filled with the life that the cure takes away.

I was instantly taken with Lena and her desire to hold onto her mother's memory, but also to separate herself from it. She wants to be a good image in her family and knowing that the cure will tear her apart from her best friend Hana, is devastating. In Lena's world, love is a disease and diseases must be inoculated. When Lena begins to have deliria-like feelings for Alex, she begins to see reasons why there are Invalids and people who would rather die than lose themselves to the cure. It is terrifying and tragic and haunting and beautiful all at the same time.

The premise of Delirium is so entirely captivating that I did not want to put the book down and I cannot stop thinking about it. Lena, Alex, Hana, even Gracie all tore into my heart and made me love them. If this is deliria, then I do not want the cure. Lauren Oliver's writing is stunning and the ending, oh, the ending, it killed me. I implore you to buy Delirium, open it the second you get it, and don't stop until you reach the back cover. It's amazing and incredible and this review does not do it justice.

Opening line: It has been sixty-four years since the president and the Consortium identified love as a disease, and forty-three since the scientists perfected a cure. ~ pg. 9

Favorite lines: 
Sometimes I feel like if you just watch things, just sit still and let the world exist in front of you - sometimes I swear that just for a second time freezes and the world pauses in its tilt. Just for a second. And if you somehow found a way to live in that second, then you would live forever. ~ pgs. 110-111

And this one:

As I lie there with the hurt driving through my chest and the sick, anxious feeling churning through me and the desire for Alex so strong inside of me it's like a razor blade edging its way through my organs, shredding me, all I can think is: It will kill me, it will kill me, it will kill me. And I don't care. ~ pg. 166

And he made Darby so inocent and realistic is was mind boggeling. I Loved the quick to start out beginging. Unlike in the firm. Which is by the way my favorite book. Yet I dind't like how he wrapped up the problem. I still rate this book 4 STARS and hope it the best of luck.
281,The Pelican Brief,0385339704,John Grisham,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,I really liked it. I don't like reading but this kept my interest.
281,The Pelican Brief,0385339704,John Grisham,Barnes and Noble,4.2,BeachRead245,"A few years ago John Grisham wrote a novel The Pelican Brief.  I recently reread it! Is it still as good as before?
Synopsis:
Darby is in her second year of Law School at Tulane University.  She is having an affair with her professor Callahan.  Life could not get any better!  Then one day Justices Rosenberg and Jenson are murdered.  Darby hears about the murders and thinks she can figure out who did it.  Classes are skipped hours are spent figuring out a theory on who did it.  One day Callahan takes a look at the brief after Darby dismisses her theory.  He offers to show her brief to a friend of his in D.C. who works with the FBI.  Little did they know the chain reaction of events that would happen because of this brief?  People start dying in order to protect the interests of one wealthy client of White and Blazevich.  Who can Darby rely on once these events start occurring?
My Thoughts:
I think that The Pelican Brief will have a permanent place on my bookshelf.  I don&rsquo;t know if it is the strong female lead character of Darby Shaw.  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong the other characters are great too!  
To write a good thriller there must be detail.  It helps us understand the action later in the story.  There are times when I want to say okay this great but why is this important!  Then it is revealed later in the story.  There were some slow spots in The Pelican Brief but still a great story."
282,Coraline,0061139378,Neil Gaiman,Barnes and Noble,4.3,bookduck,"This lovely book has been through check-in many times at the library, and every time,one of my coworkers--a real Neil Gaiman fan--would tell me to read it. I'm so glad I finally did.

Coraline and her family move to a new flat that is part of a larger house, which is appropriately big and creepy. While exploring her new home, Coraline discovers a large door in the drawing room. Her mother unlocks it (with an appropriately large, old looking black key, of course) to reveal a brick wall. When Coraline opens the door by herself, though, the brick wall is gone! She goes through a strange corridor and finds a flat exactly like hers, complete with copies of her neighbors and her ""other"" parents--all with shiny black buttons for eyes (I still don't understand the buttons, but they are rather creepy). Soon, Coraline realizes that her other mother is up to no good.

One of the best things about Coraline is that it's funny. Coraline tells it like it is. My favorite deadpan of hers occurs in a conversation with her neighbors, the delightfully named Misses Spink and Forcible:

""How are your dear mother and father?"" asked Miss Spink.

""Missing,"" said Coraline. ""I haven't seen either of them since yesterday. I'm on my own. I think I've probably become a single child family.""

Ha! That still gets me. I thoroughly enjoyed Coraline's talkative feline ally, as well.

In the end, though, Coraline is more than just scary and funny at twists and turns. The quote at the beginning of the book--

Fairy tales are more than true: not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten. --G.K. Chesterton

--fits Coraline's story very well.

This book was written for children, but I believe that people of any age group can enjoy it. I know I did!"

Generally, I'm better than most people at finding allegories within works of fiction, being a nit-picky satirist myself.  I can give you symbolism for every event in Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle.  I can give you the moral, philosophical points of Burgess' A Clockwork Orange.  I can decode the works of Burroughs.  But 'On the Road' left me feeling like it was pointless...a good, enjoyable read, but...pointless.         So here's my advice:  Read the book, don't believe the hype.  Enjoy the story, but don't expect it to be life-changing, intellectually charged, and allegorically moral, like so many fans want you to believe."
284,On the Road,0140042598,Jack Kerouac,Barnes and Noble,4,DStan58,"To anyone with a wildly out of control friend, that one who makes you crazy but you just can't quit, the story of Sal and Dean will send echos through your head. To anyone who wants to intimately know the post-WWII wanderlust that struck so many Americans, to anyone who wants to know how the Beats and the hippies came to be, this is the bible.
Genius."
284,On the Road,0140042598,Jack Kerouac,Barnes and Noble,4,GeorgyPorgy,"The most useful purpose On the Road serves is not as a great character exploration - which it is - or as a wild adventure story - which it isn't - but as for better understanding a generation of people inspired by it.  In some ways, it's a book about nothing, a book about drifting... which sometimes makes for an aimless narrative, but does capture the way so many have wandered after.

The most appropriate thing about this nook version is that you can take Kerouac's classic on the road with you:)"
285,"The Rosie Project (Don Tillman, #1)",1476729085,Graeme Simsion,Barnes and Noble,4.2,MomcatKL,"The book was absolutely delightful. I didn&rsquo;t want to put it down once I started reading. The author has done an outstanding job creating realistic likeable characters, or in one case, a true scuzzball. All of the main characters grow and develop over the course of the story as they learn from their experiences. I found myself rooting for Don, the main character, and Rosie each step of their journey to find a wife for Don and Rosie&rsquo;s biological father. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a book with endearing but also complex characters and a story that is inspiring without being sappy.

Don is a professor of genetics at a university. He is also definitely on the autism spectrum although he does not seem to realize that he is. He wants to find a wife but the problem is he has never even been on a date. So in his usual methodical manner he decides to create the Wife Project, a sixteen-page questionnaire designed to find his perfect partner. It does not go over well with the women he meets. Another professor at the university, one of his two friends, takes a look at the questionnaire and its results suggests that he send Don a candidate. He sends Rosie to meet Don. Rosie is one her own quest to find her biological father and needs help from a geneticist. Don decides very quickly that Rosie is not a potential wife but he offers it help her try to find her father. The two of them embark on a whirlwind adventure of discovery mostly about who they really are and how you can&rsquo;t decide ahead of time who you will fall in love with.

Disclosure: I received this book as part of a Goodreads giveaway on the premise that I would review it."
285,"The Rosie Project (Don Tillman, #1)",1476729085,Graeme Simsion,Barnes and Noble,4.2,PattyWPW,"I highly recommend this book. I loved it. It is told from the point of view of Don. He is a professor and has Asperger's. It a funny, lovely romance. Don did not think he would ever be able to find a wife for himself as he is not good in social situations. As he says at the beginning of the book, he has 2 friends, Gene and his wife, 4 if he counts their children. But another tells him he would make a good husband so he creates the ""Wife Project"". This in turn leads him to Rosie. Please read this book if you like funny romances with a bit of a twist."
285,"The Rosie Project (Don Tillman, #1)",1476729085,Graeme Simsion,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"Fantastic read that is perfect mix of science, drama, comedy and romance. I would best descibe it as what it would be like if Sheldon Cooper was trying to find a wife. Science and structure rule over the main character Don, but his world gets flipped topsy when Rosie comes into the picture. Funny read with plenty of sarcasm and wit and just the right amount of mush. Side note: met the author at a book signing in Nashville TN: incredibly nice bloke. Just as funny as you'd imagine. You should buy his book. It is a fabulous read."

Very nicely done!  First, his style is easy to read and his story didn't drag on forever with useless details.  Next, I was very impressed that his story included a veteran dealing with the horrors of war and another character who is a dirtbag that uses women - yet this book didn't have one single cuss word in it.  There were loveable characters who made me laugh and I even cried reading this book too.  It had just the right amount of drama, light, funny moments and wasn't overly mushy in the love part of the story.  I'll be reading Mr. Sparks' work again soon!"

287,The Fountainhead,0451191153,"Ayn Rand, Leonard Peikoff",Barnes and Noble,4.4,FocoProject,"What amazes me about this book, is that a lot of people are under the impression that this is a book about architecture. I remember back in `96, when I was in architecture school and people found out about it, they would ask me if I had read The Fountainhead. I would tell them I hadn¿t and they would suggest that I read it, because it is ¿a book about architecture.¿This book is NOT about architecture.It deals with architects. It deals with buildings. It deals with the creation process and it meaning, but that very well could have been all substituted by a painter, or a director, or a freaking plumber. This book is beyond everything else a philosophical statement on what Ayn Rand calls Objectivism, pitted against Collectivism which is its antithesis. One one end you have the ego, and the egotist, which holds above everything else the self. True, honest and unwilling to dilute his/her ideas, the egotist, stands above the thoughts of the mob, which is too simple to understand. This is Howard Roark, the genius who is calmly driven by his own confidence and morality, without need of religion and without need of assurance from his peers. On the other hand you have the man that will sacrifice the self, for the masses, the `humanitarian¿, the one Ayn Rand calls through her characters, the second-handers. These are the people that live to please the masses, that sacrifice self-worth in exchange for the praise that comes with making others happy. And of these, there are many in this book.It is an interesting point of view, in my opinion too idealistic and extremely black and white to ever fully function in society, but the argument she makes is interesting nonetheless.The book as a whole, philosophies aside, is interesting, even if it deals with architecture and most of the people have very little background in the subject. However, because of the philosophy that has been injected into the material, the dialogue tends to get on the heavy side, and some of the characters seem a bit too extreme to seem real. As a result, this is not the type of book that one becomes a part of, but rather one that we can see unfold in a rather voyeuristic sense. There is nothing particularly wrong with that, but its simply a different approach.Though I do not agree with the idea of objectivism, and I fail to see the world in the way this book describes, there is a lot of good points raised, a lot of material that brings up for interesting thought and conversation if you are into discussing philosphy. But you do not have to agree with the book to appreciate it for its fine quality, its intricate plot, its very fleshed out characters and twists which one never quite sees coming.This is a heavy, intelligent read and one that requires a bit more of an investment from the reader, where nothing is quite left in the surface and written out over 727 pages in small print. If you pick up this book, expect to put time into getting through it. I personally am not a fast reader, so it took me a while¿but the content and the story are intriguing that one never quite feels like it is dragging."
287,The Fountainhead,0451191153,"Ayn Rand, Leonard Peikoff",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Chrissie11,"Anyone that has read Ayn Rand's fiction is familiar with her complex character development, her intelligent plot progression, and her unique and captivating philosophies. The Fountainhead falls seamlessly in line with the other fantastic works in Rand's impressive collection. 
I was intimidated when I first began this book. Rand's other pieces have shown great depth of understanding and contain abstract, advanced concepts on politics, society, and mankind itself. However, everything that I had read had been reasonably short, like her novel Anthem, which is around one hundred and fifty pages, or her 120 page long play, Night of January 16th.  It is a story of a man that will not give up his self to the common way of thinking. He holds firm to his daring and controversial ideas in spite of those who strive to break him. 
Howard Roark, the hero of The Fountainhead, is a bold, intelligent architect with unfailing integrity. He meets one obstacle after another as he tries to build in a society that glorifies classical architectural forms and refuses to accept Roark's modern and innovative designs. 
Peter Keating is Roark's past colleague who gives up everything that makes up his spirit in order to gain success in the competitive world of architecture. He hates Roark for his integrity and honorable, unfailing ideals.
 Dominique Francon is the stunning, fascinating, intelligent daughter of a prestigious architect, who falls terribly in love with Howard Roark, but tries to tear down his career and marries his enemy.
A vast number of people work to sabotage Roark's career, but find that he will not yield.
The Fountainhead is a beautiful tribute to the spirit of man. Rand depicts the courage that must be had in order for a man to cleave to his innate ego and power and portrays how inspiring that strength can be. I think her concept is magnificent; - that people are willing to succumb to the popular opinion or the accepted norm and give up their true selves, their souls (in a secular sense) to simply obtain recognition. Her flawless and intricate writing adds to the depth of her story and philosophy. This is a book that takes reflection and a willingness to search for understanding, but the reward will surely justify the effort."
287,The Fountainhead,0451191153,"Ayn Rand, Leonard Peikoff",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"Rand's writing is captivating and intelligent. The character development is wonderful, and I was unable to put the book down. I have recommended The Fountainhead to multiple friends and to my book club with rave reviews from anyone who's read it. It is an important addition to anyone's personal library."
288,"The Hunt for Red October (Jack Ryan Universe, #4)",0425172902,Tom Clancy,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Guest,"The Hunt for Red October in this Clancy tells the story of a run away sub from Russia. This sub is special because it has a caterpillar drive, allows a submarine to move through the water silently and making it almost impossible to be tracked with sonar. Captain Marko Ramius is the man responsible for taking the Red October on the first voyage. His intent is different from that of his mission. He intends to take Red October and hand it over to the Americans. Clancy does a great job describing each of these events and I think that is his best equality of writing.  Clancy is a great writer and everyone should give this book a chance."

289,"Watership Down (Watership Down, #1)",038039586X,Richard Adams,Barnes and Noble,4.4,CrossWind,"I love this story, it is wonderful, a whole world and it's history.  It is a story of overcoming obstacles, and makes some powerful statements about community and being part of a team, yet shows the dangers of collectivism & socialism.  I wish this hardback version had the illustrations and quotes that were in the original paperback... (or is the preview just not showing them?)"
289,"Watership Down (Watership Down, #1)",038039586X,Richard Adams,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"Watership Down is one of the best in classic literature. It is a novel about the lives of a small group of rabbits in search of a home after their warren is destroyed by humans. In the book, the leader of the rabbits, called Hazel, and his friend Fiver the mystic both lead their gang across rivers, escaping predators, and humans with their snares and traps. The rabbits finally find a good place to make their new warren, and after doing so are faced with the problem of there not being enough rabbits to keep the warren going. They attempt to solve the problem by trying to steal some pet rabbits from a farm nearby. When that doesn&rsquo;t work to plan, they decide to find another warren and to convince some of their rabbits to come to the new warren. When they find a new warren, they find it under the tyrannical reign of a huge rabbit named General Woundwort. After they escape from his guards they plan on raiding his warren and taking some of his rabbits that are not as loyal. They succeed by a small margin, and the General pursues them. Soon they find themselves in a war, each side fighting for their lives. During the book they tell each other side stories of a mythical rabbit named El-ahrairah, yet do not realize their adventure is a legend in itself. I think part of the reason Richard Adams wrote this book was because he wanted to show how rabbits live, and how their lives are affected by humans. I liked the originality of this book, and the way it intertwines a view of the world through a rabbits eyes, within a human world. I also liked how the story tells of their journey, and when they finish the journey half way through the book it continues with a new problem. I did not like the way he used weird made up words to describe human things, because it made the story hard to read and awkward. Despite this, this book has earned itself a five star rating, above average. This is a book everyone should read, because it is such a great classic, and shows a new view on life. I would also like to recommend &lsquo;The Dragons Nine Sons&rsquo;, because after reading that, I vowed to recommend it to everyone I could. It is the best book I have ever read and will probably never be beaten. No one can go without reading it; it is a science fiction masterpiece."
289,"Watership Down (Watership Down, #1)",038039586X,Richard Adams,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"I had to read Watership Down for my 7th grade English class, and started out disliking it immensely. I mean, I don't know a single seventh grader who would actually enjoy reading a 400+ page book about talking rabbits. As I read more and more in the book, though, my opinion of Watership Down changed drastically. I realized that the themes and characters in the book are powerful and more than they appear to be. The characters are vivid and strong, and I especially liked Hazel, the beloved and courageous chief rabbit who proves his worth again and again to his people. The ending in Watership Down was perfect, and it will have a lasting impression on me. My advice to possible readers is this: Watership Down is a great book. Yes, it was sometimes slow and tiresome, but it was also more than a book about talking rabbits. Don't let those rabbits stop you from such a wonderful story. I was pleasantly surprised by this book, and would recommend it to anyone who appreciates quality literature."

I have to say, I am glad I purchased the audio version because so much of the humor is in Mindy's delivery. Mindy's delightful rambling is an invitation into the mind of a young, witty, charming,  and hysterically funny woman. I found my self wanting to interject and converse with her because I became so wrapped up in the ""conversation"" we were having. As with most of the best conversations, Mindy travels from topic to topic relating her experiences and observations in a light hearted whimsical  random fashion. She and I could hang all day long and talk about nothing while talking about everything at the same time. Does this review leave you curiously entertained, but no more informed that when we started? Good! That's how the book goes. And I loved it!  Enjoy!"

291,Cutting for Stone,0375414495,Abraham Verghese,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"Don't miss this incredible novel -- one of the finest books I've read in many years. It's an amazing story of fact and fiction, man and medicine, faith and doubt, hope and dreams, and the incredible courage to survive and achieve. It is so well written you become part of the story, cannot put the book down, and are disappointed when there is no more to read. But I immediately bought the author's two non-fiction books, which are like sequels to the novel, and was equally impressed with them. Presuming he's as good a doctor as he is a writer, he's an amazing man!"
291,Cutting for Stone,0375414495,Abraham Verghese,Barnes and Noble,4,WestTexasReader,"I picked up this book without really thinking about it or employing my usual habit of reading at least the first 8 to 10 pages to see if I would like it.  After a bit of a slow start, I could not put this book down.  The character development was wonderful.  By the end of the book, I felt sad that these characters I had gotten to know so well would no longer be a part of my life.  The story also takes the reader through several years and many continents making the story even more enjoyable and educational.
I enjoyed this book so much that I gave my Kindle to my eldest daughter so that she could read it, and bought a hardback copy so that my youngest daughter and husband could read and enjoy it also.  I am now considering reading the book again - just for my own enjoyment.  Don't miss this wonderful book!  I have recommended it to many of my friends and I am now recommending it to you!"

I found myself slowing down at the end because I didn't want the story to come to an end. And when I did finish, I just wanted to hug the book. The characters were so real and richly developed. I was transported to another time and place and didn't want to leave. And the way the compassion and love of medicine was woven into the story was pure genius.

292,"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (Chronicles of Narnia, #3)",006112527X,"C.S. Lewis, Pauline Baynes",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Bean76,"This is a book I've been reading to my kids for the last several weeks. They were eager to start reading it after we rented the movie one night. They all liked the book very much, and even though it is different from the movie in many instances, they still found it very enjoyable in its own right.
This book continues the story of Edmund and Lucy Pevensie, who are staying with an aunt and uncle while the rest of their family takes a trip to America. Their cousin Eustace despises them and their stories of Narnia. One afternoon Eustace finds himself drawn with his cousins into a painting in Lucy's bedroom, and they are all whisked off to Narnia for an adventurous sea voyage.
I don't think I have ever met a more offensive and whining character than Eustace. I find it so funny that Lewis named the character Eustace, because Useless Eustace describes him perfectly at the beginning of the book. Happily, Eustace goes through some miraculous transformations, physically and socially, during the children's adventures, and ends up to be a very useful boy at the end.
Reepicheep, the courageous mouse, also makes this book quite memorable. He is always daring the crew of the Dawn Treader to keep sailing forward, and never seems to know the meaning of the words doubt and fear. Just like Lucy, I want to pick him up and just hug the stuffing out of him, but that would be quite disrespectful behavior towards such a gallant knight!"

I thought that the intro was also good and did explain where Stevenson got his ideas for the book, and much better than the intro for Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, which I felt gave the ending away too early.  I was hoping the book would be a bit more exciting, but there was enough action throughout. I have read better books, but I have also read worse, so that is why I gave this book 4 stars."

I was always put off of Stephen King as a reader, mostly because of the creepy movies that came from his books, but this was different. This book was almost historical fiction with a time travel twist, and Stephen King makes every detail come alive, and I blew through it, crying like a schoolgirl as I read the last page.

So many writers get stale but this is fresh and new and yet quintessentially King.  His quirky humor abounds and his turn of phrase delights.  He wrapped a love story around the bleakest day in American political history and created magic.  His attention to detail regarding life in the 60's is amazing and brought back so many memories (and smells).  Read this because you are a fan of romance.

Even more so than Slaughterhouse Five, Cat's Cradle exhibits Vonnegut's biting writing style and wonderfully odd ways of telling a story. The entire novel can be taken as a cynical review of humanity and its absurdity. Cat's Cradle has to be the best treatment of the end of the world I've yet read, ranking up there with Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy in humor but with a great deal more cynicism.

If you enjoyed the movie Doctor Strangelove you will enjoy this novel. I highly recommend it for all readers."
297,Cat's Cradle,0140285601,Kurt Vonnegut Jr.,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Hannah_Sandle,"Cat's cradle is a biting and witty satire based on Vonnegut's own experiences working in public relations for GE. The story centers around a young narrator, John (or Jonah) who is doing research for a book he plans to write focusing on what Americans were doing the day the atomic bomb was dropped on hiroshima. His journey for research takes an interesting turn when he learnes that one of the primary developers of the atomic bomb, Dr. Felix Hoenikker, invented a deadly substance called ice-9. His interest in the substance leads him to the destitute island of San Lorenzo, where romance and danger await him.

I found this book to be a fun and easy read. I loved the incorporation of Bokonism throughout the novel as foreshadowing, and I thought it added an extra level of satire as a commentary on religion. I reccomend this book to those interested in adventure, humor, science fiction, and well, just good literature!"

Though time travel, a genre given life by H G Wells is the ultimate epic sci-fi adventure. The very idea of time travel has opened the eyes of every imagination in my soul. The ramifications are endless. H G Well's Time Machine is my favorite, all time story. Even when you think of how the future looked as grim as it did thousands of years from the story-line's origination, one only needs to remember that this tale is merely one possiblity of billions that could be changed with a simple act of maybe a push of a button or even less. I believe THAT was the message Wells was revealing to us all. This is a very well written story that I highly recommend to anyone of any age or time. This very book was my biggest inspiration since I was first able to read."

Wells, Greg Bear, Carlo Pagetti",Barnes and Noble,3.8,Guest,this was a interesting book but i am not that interested in science.  there were parts in the book that were very interesting and had a great climax.  i recommend this book for someone who likes science and mystery.

Thanks to this wonderful author and seer we have unlimited stories of time travel via many fantastic authors. Time travel is the subject of much controversy, and no doubt will be until we prove Albert Einstein wrong. I like sci-fi, that's why I picked up the book back when I was kid. Today, the subject still fascinates me. The time machine is well written, opening the door for an endless line of sci-fi lovers with open minds for imagination."

This family's story shows how God can use a tragedy to bring about change in people's lives.  This book has made me stop and think about my faith in a fresh new way and encouraged me to keep the faith."

The book itself was written by his father, but simply retells the conversations he has had over a period of time with his son. As the father of a four year old boy myself I was very interested in reading this story. I have read many books on heaven, people's visions and encounters but none that involved someone so young. What sets this one apart from all the others is the simplicity and innocence of heaven explained through the eyes of a child. This is not a story about white fluffly clouds but rather a divine revelation of heaven given to a child. The descriptions from the mouth of this child (Colton) is very convincing and makes it hard to deny that he truly did have this heavenly encounter as a lot of what he say's matches up with scripture. There are several points I can remember being blown away and having my heart encouraged by the way Colton describes how Jesus feels for his children. As I read I could picture my 4 year old using many of the same descriptions had it happened to him. As much as I believe this child had an encounter there was something that tripped me up in the book a little bit. This was simply the idea that everybody in heaven had wings. I'm not writing off the book because of this, simply because I have not personally been to heaven. This is just something that I have never thought to be a truth about heaven. I also realize that a lot of Colton's descriptions came months after the event and it is entirely possible that a child's imagination can run wild. With an open mind I am also open to being proved wrong when I see heaven for myself.
The book itself was well written and very easy to read. If you have a good chunk of time it would not be difficult to read the book in it's entirely in one sitting. I recommend this book to anybody, it is a different perspective than what you would normally have, it is encouraging and it gets you thinking about heaven (which is always a good thing).
This book was provided by Nelson House Publishers for my review. I was not required to give this book a positive review."

300,The Boy in the Striped Pajamas,0385751060,John Boyne,Barnes and Noble,4.3,bookseeker11,"This book The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, is one the most touching,inspirational and heart warming book I have read! When you are finished with the book the story of Shmuel and Bruno will always be with you. I recommend this book to anyone!. But be prepared, make sure you have a box of kleenex with you, it sure will bring on the waterworks :]"
300,The Boy in the Striped Pajamas,0385751060,John Boyne,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Always_Classic,"The book is written from a perspective that's hard to write from. Seeing the Holocaust through the eyes of a child is a view I haven't seen before. Boyne captures this perspective very well. The ending was very rushed. It was all summed up in about two pages. That's the only thing bad about this book. If you're looking for a book to start a discussion in a classroom or inspire writers to write outside of the box, then this is your book."
300,The Boy in the Striped Pajamas,0385751060,John Boyne,Barnes and Noble,4.3,KRT333,Its a heartbreaking story about a boy named Bruno and his new found friend Shmuel. This book will keep your atention the intire time you are reading it. Stop reading reveiws and just read the book!
301,Heart of Darkness,1892295490,Joseph Conrad,Barnes and Noble,3.5,mariamsultana on LibraryThing,"Beautifully written, but I've read too much about international development to actually feel for the narrator. It's too much of a pity party for him."
301,Heart of Darkness,1892295490,Joseph Conrad,Barnes and Noble,3.5,placo75 on LibraryThing,"The language is not easy, especially for a lazy American like me, but the book is excellent in many ways. I loved the imagery."

302,Safe Haven,044654759X,Nicholas Sparks,Barnes and Noble,4.2,sadlere,Nicholas Sparks never lets me down. I could read his books everyday. This one you will not be able to put down. Loved It.
302,Safe Haven,044654759X,Nicholas Sparks,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Courtoy15,"This book was so good. I had heard mixed reviews and have read and loved many of Sparks' novels but this one is by far my favorite. It reminded me a little of Julia Robert's movie Sleeping with the enemy, but they are different enough and there is a HUGE twist at the very end that I definitely did not see coming.. I definitely recommend this book."
302,Safe Haven,044654759X,Nicholas Sparks,Barnes and Noble,4.2,h8rain,"Halfway through I thought it would have a typical ending but no, NS has surprised us all. Thankfully this one was not a tear-jerker just a 'good ending' book. VERY well done!!!"
303,"The Secret (The Secret, #1)",1582701709,Rhonda Byrne,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Richard_the_Reader,"I am 75 and have been reading 50-60 books a year since I retired.  I resisted reading ""The Secret"" for a very long time but finally gave in to curiosity in that I wanted to see what all the excitement was about and what would cause it to remain on the best seller lists for such a long period. I am sorry to report that there is no secret.  Norman Vincent Peale told us all we needed to know about the power of positve thinking back in the '50s and the ""law of attraction"" is nothing but new age psycho-babble.  What an incredible waste of time and money.  H.L.Mencken once wrote ""no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public"".  I don't know whether the author is incredibly cynical or the victim of an, as of yet, undiagnosed mental illness but this book is a clear demonstration of the concept that good marketing can sell anything.  I must admit that I am no fan of ""New Age"" pseudo-philosophy.  Nevertheless, I tried my best to read with an open mind and assumed that the success of this book must indicate SOME socially redeeming features.  The ""ideas"" are simplistic, superficial and repetitive and the only ""secret"" of this unfortunate book is that the author has been made a multi-millionaire and the reading public has been bamboozled and is too dazzled or embarassed to admit that the emperor has no clothes.  This book is the written equivalent of snake-oil however cleverly marketed.  If anyone is truly interested in an inspirational book, much better to spend your time, money and emotional energy on ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"" by Betty Smith."
303,"The Secret (The Secret, #1)",1582701709,Rhonda Byrne,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Asilverstone1,"What a truly amazing book this is! Also love Marty Jenkins , the two have the same type of 'thinking' ways except this is more of a step by step guide and Marty Jenkins is more of a story form, both very popular books, Im leaning on Marty Jenkins book at bit more but overall  these are good must have books!"
303,"The Secret (The Secret, #1)",1582701709,Rhonda Byrne,Barnes and Noble,3.7,faison_tman,"The huge success of Rhonda Byrnes book ""The Secret"" speaks for itself. In reading some of the reviews I must admit it appears that some are simply ""reactions"" rather than true reviews. I found Ms Byrnes approach to be remarkably engaging and certainly provokes thought. Her references again and again to ""Avatars.Teachers, and great Leaders through the ages shows she has painstakenly researched the truths that have had some of the greatest impact in the lives of significant numbers of people. She is not offering her insights or rather her restatement of old truths as a new manuscript of reference to compete with or replace the Bible. To me what she covers in the book are things many of us have discovered in our lives or the lives of others to be true. This is the crux of the matter, if something is true, there is a reason why it is true. If something works it becomes an established principle that repeats itself again and again when the principle is applied. It does not matter who said it or how it was said if it is effectual in it's results then it has special significance. In watching the video and also reading the book, I was impressed with the energy and inspiration that was being expressed. It certainly was not negative energy or blasphemy against God. It was a treatise of encouragement in positive thought, faith, love, and expectation of doing more, experiencing more, achieving more and with an almost childlike faith an obvious confidence that good things will come forth. Without going into detail the emphasis on the ""law of attraction"" proves itself in the lives of people everyday and has done so through the ages. I liked the book and found it beneficial. Does it cover all the points of doctrine or my personal beliefs in ways perhaps I am accustomed to? No but that does not appear to be its purpose. With one broad sweep the book covers some of the most important truths that can bring some of the greatest changes for good in peoples lives. That seems to be the real issue, has it helped anyone? Apparently, it has helped thousands in many different ways. We may have our various religious positions but sometimes some things are presented in ways that differ from our personal approach and yet they may produce enormous beneficial results. To me ""The Secret"" is one of those things. No one is asked to leave their church, turn their backs on the Bible or become members of any new kind of cult, they are simply reminded of things that have been known by some through the ages that are powerful when applied in one's life.

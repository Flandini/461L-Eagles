1315,Blankets,1891830430,Craig Thompson,Barnes and Noble,4.4,zonde,"In this graphic novel Craig Thompson has managed to make some of the most relateable characters I have ever read. Mostly the story of a first love from beginning flirtations to a bitter end, the story also takes you through the progression of mind and memory and how we become who we are. While reading there are a range of emotions that you go through and in the end you close the book and think about your own progression and growth. From the moment I picked the book up I did not want to put it down. The pictures and text work fantastically together. I stayed up all night to finish it. I recommend it to anyone who has ever questioned life, religion, love,or themselves and other; or anyone simply looking for an amazing work of art to read and revisit over and over."
1315,Blankets,1891830430,Craig Thompson,Barnes and Noble,4.4,sliprockdoc,"This book is amazing: ""footnotes"" section should be read many times to appreciate his message. This could be used in a freshman philosophy class as a way of introducing the study of philosophy.  Exceptional.  Haunting.  Can't stop thinking about it.  Beautiful."
1315,Blankets,1891830430,Craig Thompson,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"I thought that Blankets was ok, probably because I'm a little young. I also read it in one day, becuase it was so hard to put down. It was a little graphic, but beyond that, the story is beautiful and Craig and Phil as children are so innocent. It makes you think, and makes you find the meanings behind each picture. I got into graphic novels when I read this book."
1316,The Story of Edgar Sawtelle,0061374229,David Wroblewski,Barnes and Noble,3.6,adambomb314,"Please do not read this book. I just finished it and have never felt more betrayed and letdown by a book before. If you would have asked me yesterday what I thought of the book, I would have told you I loved it. The characters were engrossing, the language was at once a combination of being sparse and detailed. There was just the right amounts of mystery and beauty, and a touch of the otherworldly. In fact, I felt that anything was possible and plausible in the world of the book. I just don't see the point  after finishing it. Why did I go through all of Edgar's struggles only to be stabbed in the back by the author. To me, a story should have a reason, a lesson, a moral objective. But where was it? If it was in there it was overshadowed by the ending, which is all I can think about now. Ripping the readers guts out over the course of a book is good, if there is some kind of satisfaction in the outcome of the story. I think the books objective could have been achieved with a different ending, while still being true to the story. I don't even need a full on happy ending, thats not my point. My point is that misery for misery's sake is just pointless. I lived in Wisconsin, and I love dogs, so maybe I fell a little too hard for this book."
1316,The Story of Edgar Sawtelle,0061374229,David Wroblewski,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Anonymous,"You have to have an open mind when reading this book or you definitely won't ""get it.""  If you like everything tied up in a neat little package and don't like difficult words (you might even have to look some up), this is probably not the book for you.  But if you enjoy feeling like you're living right there with the characters and seeing right through their eyes, this author can take you there.  I especially liked seeing the world through Almondine's eyes.  It made me understand how my own dogs probably see the world.  A terrible sadness gripped me right in the pit of my stomach at the end, but I also felt joy that Almondine's spirit was there for Edgar and I was glad Claude suffered too.  I think the ending is open to interpretation, which is good because it gets people talking about the book.  I felt somehow that Forte would join the dogs and become their leader, perhaps even take them to Henry.  I felt like the dogs were able to almost communicate telepathically with each other.   Towards the end of the book I felt excitement and fear and dread for Edgar, disgust and loathing for Claude and pity for Trudy - and I just couldn't put the book down.  I actually went back and read the last three chapters one more time after I had finished. I can't wait for him to write another book!"
1316,The Story of Edgar Sawtelle,0061374229,David Wroblewski,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Anonymous,I'll keep it short and sweet.  It was a wonderful book until the end.  I hated the ending so much that it ruined the whole book and made me wonder what the whole thing was about.
1317,Drowning Ruth,0345439104,Christina Schwarz,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,I thouroughly enjoyed this book and found the characters to be interesting and I wanted to know more.  The story is written in both first and third person and from different character perspectives.  Their are many mysteries woven through this book and it has a rewarding ending although I would have liked to find a little more about the title character's future.  When all the secrets are finally revealed you will be surprised by the outcome.  I recommend this book for anyone wanting more that the regular chick lit that is out there.
1317,Drowning Ruth,0345439104,Christina Schwarz,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"So many flashbacks, flashforwards and sidetrips that this novel left me with hotflashes! A potentially strong novel of family ties and secrets is marred by the fitful starts and stops of the story line."
1317,Drowning Ruth,0345439104,Christina Schwarz,Barnes and Noble,4,jdreher1,"I loved this book.....it was very very good! I didn't even mind the few plot holes left at the end. I was looking for a different book, this was definitely different! My only regret is not picking this for book club. But then again it might be a little to dark for book club."

1318,Post Office,0876850867,Charles Bukowski,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"While it is very much the norm in modern literature to focus on the self as the central theme of the writer's work, the novelist choses this motif at his own peril. Bukowski's grasp somewhat outstrips his reach  this is because his talent to describe a reality is so much more powerful than the material that he chooses to create that reality. Very few writers since Hemingway can set the scene and paint the stage with such remarkable economy of the written word. I see the main difference between a great writer and a good one (and Bukowski is a very good one)is the scope and breadth his material. But Hemingway's world was much larger while Bukowski binds himself too closely in his nutshell. He takes us into strange fields filled with enchanting flowers, only to describe, in breathtaking detail, a blade of grass. Bukowski's fearless approach to truth as a writer comes from (what one can only assume) is his relative poverty as a human being...however well he reveals to us in this novel the transcendental beauty of his blade of grass, we long to be able devour the scents and absorb the sunlight which we can only sense is just outside the writer's realm of experience.     Hattely"

1319,"All the Pretty Horses (The Border Trilogy, #1)",0679744398,Cormac McCarthy,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,This book will reshape your soul.  I don't think it's   posssible to find another author who can capture the most   isolated moment a human soul can bear and give it beauty   in a way that releases you.  This passage alone is worth   the price of the book  -    'He slept that night in a field far from any town.  He built   no fire.  He lay listening to the horse crop the grass at his   stakerope and he listened to the wind in the emptiness   and watched stars trace the arc of the hemisphere and die   in the darkness at the edge of the world and as he lay   there the agony in his heart was like a stake.  He imagined   the pain of the world to be like some formless parasitic   being seeking out the warmth of human souls wherein to   incubate and he thought he knew what made one liable to   its visitations.  What he had not known was that it was   mindless and so had no way to know the limits of those   souls and what he feared was that there might be no   limits.'
1319,"All the Pretty Horses (The Border Trilogy, #1)",0679744398,Cormac McCarthy,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"This novel is a pretty good plot, but the lack of punctuation and slowly progressing story make it difficult to get through at times. The themes and charactization of the book rely on the main charater, John Grady Cole, adventuring into the dying wild west to live out his dream of living off the land in a life full of horses after growing up in the modernizing of Texas. Throughout the novel the image Cole once had of being a cowboy is wreaked when he faces the reality of social constraits and difficulties presented in the time. Additionally, the book as some comic relief, but at times can be rather violent and saddening."
1319,"All the Pretty Horses (The Border Trilogy, #1)",0679744398,Cormac McCarthy,Barnes and Noble,3.9,kyuen1,"Cormac McCarthy has a singular talent: he can write in a lean, minimalist prose that, at the same time, is devastating in its beauty and emotion. Reading this novel was like being under a hypnotic trance, where the characters inhabit a world that is real and merciless but also surreal and haunting. The dialogue blends seamlessly with the thoughts of the characters and with the painting of the landscape, so that they all portray a living, breathing entity. Some readers might be put off by the slow burning, almost cold approach to the writing; but the end result is an achievement, stunning in its poetic imagery."
1320,"The Complete Sherlock Holmes, Vol 2",1593082045,"Arthur Conan Doyle, Kyle Freeman",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Kaydern,"I suppose I started reading this collection for the same reason I watch regular TV shows every week. I wanted consistently interesting short stories, and that's exactly what I got. However I made a mistake reading them all straight through in this convenient collection, and the formulaic plots bothered me more than they would have otherwise. 

I did notice an improvement in terms of the mystery complexity, which I appreciated. No where is this more evident than in ""The Valley of Fear"", which uses an extremely similar set-up to ""A Study in Scarlet"". Both stories have two parts, the first of which takes place in 1890's England and the second some years previous in America. However everything else about ""The Valley of Fear"" is a vast improvement! The murder mystery is much more clever, the action is better paced, and the second part was well-introduced as well as being a mystery story in it's own right! Clearly Sir. Doyle had come into his own as an author by this point, and his skills greatly improved with practice.

I also enjoyed the change in Watson's ""voice"" over time. Sir Doyle seems much more comfortable in his writing abilities by ""The Valley of Fear"", and I felt there was less awkward prose. I noticed Sir Doyle has a very fanciful way of describing the scene, which appeals to me greatly. I shall always imagine a foggy London day as John Watson saw it."
1320,"The Complete Sherlock Holmes, Vol 2",1593082045,"Arthur Conan Doyle, Kyle Freeman",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Darko,"So you think you know Sherlock Holmes.  Be prepared to get the details of Holmes' life and thought processes. He lives for the chase and does not know what to do with himself without one.  Many stories are told by Dr. Watson as the keeper of the case records. You'll learn about Watson as well and how he and Holmes ended up living together.

Mostly short readings for one evening with some longer stories included. Classics like The Hound of the Baskervilles and more. 

A real opportunity to get inside Holmes' head.  Highly recommend!"
1320,"The Complete Sherlock Holmes, Vol 2",1593082045,"Arthur Conan Doyle, Kyle Freeman",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"When i first had to read this book, i had the notion that it was some old boring book but it is NOT!!!

Even though FUNimation only has up to episode 195 dubbed in English, the Jap subs are amazing as well. The best character I think is Zoro, which the idiotic producers at 4Kids renamed to 'Zolo'. Roronoa Zoro sounds much better than Roronoa Zolo, dont'cha think? Yes, anyway. I love the hilarity of One Piece and its originality. The most sad backstory of the characters would have to be Chopper. Poor fella. Oda is amazing! I'm surprised more people haven't heard of this spectacular series yet. If you're not sure about it, take it anyway. If you love laughing out loud, pirates, goofy attitudes, et cetera, then you should definitely check out One Piece. A must-have for teens & up!"

1322,"The Last Unicorn (The Last Unicorn, #1)",0451450523,Peter S. Beagle,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"This wonderful book will capture not only the younger generation but adults as well.  It is far from just a story for little girls who love unicorns--although I was one such girl when I first read it.  Reading it again as an adult, I still felt the same sense of wonder and awe. Beautifully written and also touched with some wry humor, The Last Unicorn is one of those books that you just don't forget."

I know that most people are fantasy lovers, and it's hard to find another series to read, other than Harry Potter. I myself couldn't stop reading Harry Potter, even after I'd read the entire series dozens of times. Finally, I made myself look for new books to try, and my hand happened to brush the spine of this wonderful book. I opened it's pages, and practically got sucked into it. I visited this awesome world of Septimus Heap, laughing at his joys, and despairing at his losses. I never got bored or tired of this book, and kept on reading it to the end. After reading through this series, I looked for more and more books, exporing through the world of possibilities. This book showed me that there are other great books out there, though I had thought not. I really would recommend this inspiring book to readers of all ages, so they can experience the magical world of this young boy. Go ahead; try something new."

This entertaining story of how this young man develops into a hero is a must read."
1324,Fever 1793,0689848919,Laurie Halse Anderson,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"The book Fever 1793 is a wonderful book to read if you are like 10-12 years old of course it took place in 1793 it was when Washington lived. This book takes place in Philadelphia the book is about this girl named Matilda she is 12 years old and lives with her grandfather and mother (her father died). Yellow fever come into town and more then a 1,000 people  were killed it was a disaster. All of Matilda family gets sick and has yellow fever even her to find out if she died or not read this book. If u cry when you read sad book then get a tissue box and start reading!!!! :)"
1324,Fever 1793,0689848919,Laurie Halse Anderson,Barnes and Noble,4.5,graciegrace4,"Any teenager would love this book, they can perfectly relate to the main character Mattie Cook. the book begins with Mattie and her mother consistently arguing about when to do chores and work, but Mattie wants the general family coffee shop to turn into Philadelphia's greatest. Just one problem, suddenly the yellow fever strikes Philadelphia causing numerous amounts of sudden death. The yellow fever causes Mattie's family to separate, and endangering their lives. When Mattie arrives in this new land, she realizes that the fever is taking over everywhere. She has to realize how to adapt to a sick environment and survive the fever. 
              Even though the setting is based in the late 1700's you can easily relate to the characters. Mattie is like any teenage girl, she is opinionated and strong willed. The point to view of the book is in first person, from Mattie's perspective. As you read this novel, you may interpret her mother as a demanding housewife but as the story precede you realize Mattie's great appreciation for her mother. If an adult were to have read this novel, they would most likely have a different perspective of the story. 
                 I recommend this book to anyone that loves suspense and history. This book is very suspenseful, you are always thinking about what is going to happen next. It is hard to put the book down! Also this book made me realize history can be very interesting. I felt that it took me back in time. This book was so intense you could feel what the character feels. I loved this book."
1324,Fever 1793,0689848919,Laurie Halse Anderson,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Stephanie_Martin,"Fever by Laurie Halse Anderson is a book about an experience the main character Mattie has with yellow fever. This book is during the mid 1700's, when one of Mattie's relatives gets infected with yellow fever she has to go away with her grandfather. When leaving she went through many struggles, causing her life to become very difficult. Putting her life in danger to save others she cared for, becoming very dramatic.

Fever gave me a very good experience knowing how tough it was during the Fever with not that many families that didn't survive the Yellow Fever. Mattie went through many obstacles that caused her life to change, with her being much more mature and responsible.

In my opinion I believe that the book Fever was a book that taught a historical lesson, however I would have expected something else from the ending of the book. Excluding the ending I enjoyed the book very much for a person who does not enjoy books who are drsmatic. I reccomend this book to anybody who enjoys reading books with drama, suspense, and historical events."
1325,"The Likeness (Dublin Murder Squad, #2)",0670018864,Tana French,Barnes and Noble,4.1,MJinPA,"Since I enjoy knowing as little as possible before reading a story, I will not give away anything about plot or characters.

I knew absolutely nothing about this novel before reading it (I chose it because it came up on my ""Amazon recommendations"" list) and *loved* it. What a terrific idea for a thriller. I haven't felt so afraid while reading a book since I was a kid, and that was thrilling in itself. (Incidentally, I rarely experience books described by reviewers as ""frightening"" or ""riveting"" as such.)

At the very beginning, while a couple of characters were being established, the dialogue was not my favorite - a bit reminiscent of Jodi Picoult or other bestselling authors - but the story completely held my attention, and I think the dialogue would certainly play well were the manuscript converted into a screenplay. As soon as the initial characters were a bit fleshed out, I liked the dialogue much better. I loved the characters and grew attached to many of them. Also, unlike many mysteries with promising beginnings, which too often speed up and fall apart at the end, the pacing was pitch perfect.

Kudos to Tana French. I heartily recommend this novel."
1325,"The Likeness (Dublin Murder Squad, #2)",0670018864,Tana French,Barnes and Noble,4.1,denise_twilight,"Definitely this one was much better than In the Woods, at least from my humble point of view. I had trouble trying to get into the plot during the first chapters, but once Cassie's mission begins, you get into a comfortable reading pace and before you know it, you're on to the last chapter.
It is a well written story that sort of keeps with the general idea of Tana French's first novel which is an unexpected ending full of drama and that has the main character fulfilling her duty but at a high physical, emotional and mental cost. 
As I said for her previous book, give it a shot, you might hate it or you might find a good story to spend a nice quiet afternoon with."
1325,"The Likeness (Dublin Murder Squad, #2)",0670018864,Tana French,Barnes and Noble,4.1,theReader278,I loved The Likeness. It has a story that keeps you entertained for hours. I also recommend In the Woods.

If you  like  fast  paced  and  edge  of  your  seat  non-fiction ,  this  is  a  must  read . Even his  footnotes  are  interesting .  I  learned  more  about  ""The Great  War"" before  the  U.S.A. entry  than  I  did  in high  school . I would  recommend  this  book  to  anyone , only  one  small  part  about  an autopsy  might  be  too  graphic  for  younger  readers"
1326,Dead Wake: The Last Crossing of the Lusitania,0307408868,Erik Larson,Barnes and Noble,4.5,PJtheEMT4,"Dead Wake: The Last Crossing of the Lusitania  by Erik Larson is a poignant dramatized story of the sinking of the Lusitania of WW1.  This vivid drama gives not only the historical details of this pivotal event, but the emotional behind the scenes  drama that you will not read in history books.  I was so engrossed in the tory, especially the powerful account of the ship's demise.  Following the stories of multiple  voices gives the reader a unique omnipotent view of the overall picture.  This is especially moving during the account of the ship's sinking.  Going beyond a simple news paper-esque account, the author, Erik Larsen shares the intimate thoughts and emotions of the passengers as they face death.  A young boy with measles is separated from his pregnant mother in the commotion and panic as the ship is sinking.  His last horrific memory of the event is the haunting image of his mother giving birth in the cold see.  The traumatic image haunts him all the remaining days of his life.  Though the words are few, and the image is recounted in a single sentence, the emotional significance is beyond what the modern reader can imagine.  Another young mother traveling alone with her children finds herself torn between saving her infant daughter is the ship's daycare room or her toddler son sleeping alone in the bunk of her cabin. In a panic, she hands her daughter off to a stranger; next time she sees the stranger, he is scrambling onto a lifeboat- alone! The reader can only imagine the mother's grief and pain in those last moments before the ship goes under.  I found myself gripping the book tightly, hanging onto each word, reliving the horrors of those passengers and their last moments.  AT times I was reminded by the cinematic version of the Titanic- the scramble to get to lifeboats and lifejackets, the panic and the separation of families and parents from their children. Larsen is a talented writer that handles the facts as well as drama in this world changing event.  The sinking of the Lusitania- a bit of history that may occupy only a few lines to a few paragraphs in a history book, is retold moment by moment in extraordinary detail, in this 359 page book.  A number of references are included in the end as well as an index for those students and historians that may wish to use this book as a source in a research paper.  This is a must have for any WW1 or history enthusiast. As a blogger I received a copy of this book published by Crown publishers for the purpose of writing this review."
1326,Dead Wake: The Last Crossing of the Lusitania,0307408868,Erik Larson,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"A truly stunning book!! Erik Larson masterfully braids together the stories of the passengers and crew of the Lusitania, the U boat captain, the British Admiralty, and  U.S. President Wilson in this fascinating book.  This is one of those books that I did not want to put down and zipped through it in record time because it is so well written.  It kept my interest from beginning to end.   I recommend this book highly."
1327,The Jungle Book,0812504690,Rudyard Kipling,Barnes and Noble,4.4,bzedan on LibraryThing,"My mom gave me a lot of classics when I was growing up, all big-text on pulpy paper and bright covers, perfect for the young book nerd. I loved the Jungle Books, I always thought she'd read them too, but talking to her recently, I guess she never read much Kipling. I'd forgotten that the first Jungle Book has side stories about Rikki-Tikki-Tavi and the bit about the elephants dancing and whatnot. Only the first half is really about Mowgli at all. The point of reading this, besides my obvious addiction, is so that I have the story straight in my head during The Second Jungle Book, which had passages that stuck in my brain like nothing else over the years."
1327,The Jungle Book,0812504690,Rudyard Kipling,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"Well, everybody knows the movie... but as it is most of the time, the book isn't better, worse, it's just incomparable! My father read this to me when I was 8 years old, and, although I didn't understand everything in detail, it really opened me up to poetry and literature in general, and, when I later picked it up again, this time on my own, I realised that some of my ideas and principals came straight out of this book... The story is great and deep, the characters amazing and so lovable, and in every line lies a mystery, a question without an answer that the reader will have to solve (almost) alone, with the entire book as their only tool and guide. Just a simple advice: read this book, and then read it to your kids (and while you're at it, have a peek at Kipling's untimely ""so stories"" and my personal favourite ""riki-tiki-tavi"")..."

1328,"I Am Pilgrim (Pilgrim, #1)",1439177724,Terry Hayes,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Qwillery,"I Am Pilgrim is a deeply engaging thriller by Terry Hayes. It's filled with everything I love about thrillers - great characters, a frightening scenario, the slow and unrelenting build of suspense, and a deeply layered story.

Pilgrim is brilliant but so is Saracen, the person he is trying to track down to avoid a disaster of epic proportions. Watching Pilgrim's mind work is a real joy. He's clever and inventive. He is the first to admit to his shortcomings. He does make mistakes. He's not omniscient, but when it comes to investigating he has no peer.  He puts things together is ways that are remarkable yet explainable (and are explained). This adds a great deal of depth and veracity to the novel. We get to see how Pilgrim thinks. He also works hard. He hunts down clues. He's a man of action when necessary.

The Saracen is also very intelligent. His life history is slowly shown to the reader throughout the novel. The reader is privy to why he's become single-minded in his quest to bring down the United States. The Saracen is very, very patient. He is one man, more or less off the grid, planning unimaginable destruction. The plan he eventually concocts appears frighteningly real which heightens the intensity of the novel.

In addition to trying to stop the Saracen, Pilgrim is also figuring out a couple of murders that are unrelated to the Saracen plot. I enjoyed this part of the story as well because it gave me additional opportunities to see Pilgrim in action and see how his mind works.

I Am Pilgrim is a beautifully written novel with excellent pacing, wonderful twists and turns and plenty of action. The story not only switches back and forth between Pilgrim and Saracen, but there are flashbacks to Pilgrim's past. The reader gets to learn quite a bit about Pilgrim's life and who he is. Hayes handles this back and forth and the shifting story lines skillfully. There is a very strong cast of well-developed supporting characters who help or hinder Pilgrim in various ways.

I Am Pilgrim is a nail-biter. Even after 600+ pages I was disappointed that the novel ended. I wanted keep reading about Pilgrim and to be in his mind a bit more. If you enjoy well-crafted, exciting espionage thrillers this is an absolute must read."

1329,Howl and Other Poems,0872863107,"Allen Ginsberg, William Carlos Williams",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"Sure, 'Howl' is considered obscene and graphic, but hey: that's what life is. Allen Ginsberg has written the most HUMAN thing my tired eyes have read. People read it and think, 'ugh... this is all about homosexuals and drugs' but the truth is it's about a man who was loved and admired by another, and had finally gone mad. It's Ginsberg's frustration and bitterness that makes it so poignant. I read it before, and thought the same thing: 'it's about homosexuals and drugs' but I was reading beteween the lines: I wasn't digging what he was saying. Wouldn't you be a tad upset if your eccentric, but very close friend went too crazy? Yes you would. So all of you out there reading between the lines, stop whining and READ the poem."

Our children are still sacrificed to Moloch. The Machinery of Night is still in place digital, darker and more dangerous. Neil Cassidy's ghost walks along counting railroad ties in eternity, followed by Allen chanting and playing the harmonium. Jack stumbles along behind swigging on a bottle of cheap burgundy."

After opening it up and glancing through it, it't not hard to see why. The pupose of the book is to get you to look at things, common situations we all come across everyday, like being criticized or being given more work than you can possibly finish, and see them a little differently. Believe it or not, it delivers- and in just a page or two at a time if you can believe that! That's because the wisdom is definitely there, on every page, and it just plain makes sense. Many times I've read a chapter or two and thought, ""Why didn't I think of that before?"". The other good thing about this tiny book is that you could either sit down and read it cover-to-cover, or just pick it up once in awhile and pick a random chapter to read. Either way, the mini-chapters are sure to quickly leave most readers wondering why they make such a big deal out of the things they do. Other short self-help books I like include ""Finding Happiness in a Frustrating World""."

The first reviewer (anonymous) posted that the book will only be read by ignorant people and that the publisher should re-think publication. I would like to point out that if one were to actually read the review from the publisher, they actually recommend this book not be read to children. The sample verses are funny and remind me of other joke children's books such as ""Daddy Drinks because you Cry."" I hope the author and publisher continue this into a series that grows up with the kids including titles ""Go the F*** to school already"" and ""Pre-Teen Girls, Stop dressing like Wh**es"""

The point of this book, if you would have taken the time to read some of the statements made by the author, is to remind parents that we all go through the frustrations of parenting and the strain of getting our kids to cooperate. Though we have this inner dialog in our mind screaming for that 15 minutes of peace that we get when they go to sleep and we have a few minutes to wind down, we still have to suck it up and read that story to them because we are PARENTS! If you do not have a child, your opinion holds no value on the matter, if you do have children then you are either a liar if you state that you have never felt this frustration, or i suggest you go to the doctor and reduce your medication as you have become in-humanly disengaged from reality. The author states that this is a bedtime book for adults not children."

1332,"Mostly Harmless (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, #5)",0345418778,Douglas Adams,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,This book is an awesome climax to the series. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves science fiction or comedy. Douglass Adams should know how much I love this book.
1332,"Mostly Harmless (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, #5)",0345418778,Douglas Adams,Barnes and Noble,4.2,1000_Character_Reviews,"&quot;Mostly Harmless&quot; are the words that now replace all of the writing and research that Ford Prefect has created for the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy...and he wants to know why.  The Vogons are back...still trying to destroy earth, but in a different way than usual.  We also find Arthur Dent jumping through alternate universes trying to find his version of his beloved Earth...and learning that he has a moody teenage daughter spawned from his need to get traveling money.  The fifth and final (at least from Douglas Adams) entry into the Hitchhiker &quot;Trilogy&quot; is probably the most hilarious and crazy entry in the series.  I found myself laughing more at this book than the other ones.  The sarcastic and just plain weird subplots (was Elvis kidnapped by aliens? how many &ldquo;Earths&rdquo; are there in the mish-mash?) and side-stories are simply hilarious.  A great diversion, though I found the ending to be less than satisfying &ndash; very Sopranos-like."
1332,"Mostly Harmless (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, #5)",0345418778,Douglas Adams,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"The book ¿Mostly Harmless¿ by Douglas Adams is the last book in the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy series. This book sums up all of ¿the crew¿s¿ experiences together and finally gives it an ending that I would say suits the book. It all starts out when Trillian gets lost in a time warp and Arthur Dent crashes his ship on a Bob fearing planet. Yes I know it sounds strange that a whole planet fears Bob¿s but that¿s just the humor in the book. The whole book makes as much sense as that first part that I told you about so its not even worth it trying to make sense of everything. Believe me, I¿ve tried this and after using up a whole summer on it I gave up. This overall is a very funny and interesting book and really gets you thinking about the world around you."
1333,Benjamin Franklin: An American Life,074325807X,Walter Isaacson,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"If you are interested in history or politics, this book is a fantastic read about one of our Founding Fathers.  It delves deeply into Mr. Franklin's personality and the reasons behind his behavior.  It also talks about his alleged affairs in England and France.  Whereas Mr. Franklin is a great thinker and wise, this books shows how he could be quite a scoundrel.  Not only is a great book about Mr. Franklin, it is a great book about the the 'colonies' and the early United States.  If you are not a fan of US history or politics, you may not enjoy this book as much."
1333,Benjamin Franklin: An American Life,074325807X,Walter Isaacson,Barnes and Noble,4.2,ConnecticutRichard,"As someone with an unusually deep background in early American history, I almost passed up this book because, of course, we all know as much as we care to know about Ben Franklin. What a surprise! This is one of the most entertaining and informative books I have ever read. I kept looking up and saying, ""I never knew that!""

The author, Walter Isaacson, pushes past the cardboard image of the fat little sage with the witty sayings and the dangerous kite. The real Franklin steps from the pages with so many dimensions and so many (often overlooked) accomplishments that it is difficult to conceive how they could all be packed into one life. He was a man of towering achievements in science, civic organization, politics and diplomacy. 

He also had his demons and he was hated and loved with passion. His family life was bizarre and his evolution to revolution was painful. The story of how England turned an ardent supporter into an implacable foe holds lessons with modern relevance.

If you enjoyed David McCullough's ""John Adams,"" you will love this book. The research is as deep and it is much more readable."
1333,Benjamin Franklin: An American Life,074325807X,Walter Isaacson,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"Issacson's thoroughly researched and eloquently written book about one of the most amazing figures in American history is both educational and thought-provoking. From his timeless life advice, to his many inventions, to his role in the American Revolution, the reader can't help but label Franklin a genius. The writing style appeals to those simply interested in learing more about Franklin and is not just for history buffs. Highly recommended."
1334,The Tiger's Wife,0385343833,T??a Obreht,Barnes and Noble,3.5,hls1966,"This masterwork of modern literature is appreciated by readers who can enjoy a story told from many perspectives, blending modern-day narrative with flashbacks by both the narrator and her recently-deceased grandfather, with forays into folk tale and myth. By the end, all the threads are woven into an exotic tapestry where the present is enriched by the past. While many mysteries are solved, some are deliberately and deliciously left unexplained for the reader to chew on. I look forward to more by this author.  Readers who find it difficult and boring should fault themselves, not the writing. Go back to the shallow end, and don't complain that the water is too deep when you simply haven't learned to swim. And if you don't understand that metaphor, get out of the pool!"
1334,The Tiger's Wife,0385343833,T??a Obreht,Barnes and Noble,3.5,1DANA3,"Beautifully written, haunting, sometimes eerie, the stories mix myth with reality. The narrator, Natalia, is a young doctor. While on her way to vaccinate some children in an orphanage across the border, she learns that her doctor grandfather has left home on a mysterious errand and died not far from where she is headed. His body has been shipped back, but she sets out to recover his possessions and, more importantly, discover why he died so far from home. The stories are connected by common themes of mutilation and death, laying spirits to rest, and bringing the bodies home. The journey through these tales are more important than the final destination. Stories and their importance in our lives, how myth, legend and superstition shape and mold our lives are themes that run throughout the story. Interesting and intriguing read."
1334,The Tiger's Wife,0385343833,T??a Obreht,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Frisbeesage,"The Tiger's Wife is the story of Natalie, a young doctor in the Balkans, who has been raised in awe of her brilliant grandfather. As she was growing up he would often take her to the zoo to visit the tigers. Much later she is traveling across a war torn region to bring vaccinations to an orphanage when she learns that her grandfather has died under strange circumstances. When she begins to investigate improbable and magical stories of the tiger's wife and the deathless man begin to surface. 

The Tiger's Wife is a beautiful and highly unique story told in an entirely fresh style. The tone of magical realism lurking beneath the surface of Natalia's grandfather's practical life is always perfectly balanced, just enough that you can't ignore it, but never enough to sound implausible. Natalia herself can't quite believe or disbelieve and all the while the tiger is there, a shadowy presence in every dark corner. The setting of the exotic and unknown Balkans just adds to the mystery even more.

I truly enjoyed this fantastical book. It is not often that you come across such an original voice as Tea Obreht's and I look forwarding to reading more."

Snyder,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Guest,"Magic Study is the book that you see in the store and you think ...hmmm cool name way better cover art than the rest of my SF/Fantasy collection...I wonder. You pick it up, flip through the pages, don¿t really read any and decide it is probably a gimmick. Then you buy it anyway because the cover is Sooo pretty (and maybe hate yourself a little for being so shallow). You go home, sit on the sofa then read the first page. After than you can't possibly move for the next few hours and finally come up for air with a horrible neck cramp and the utter satisfaction that comes with being in the middle of a great story. You decide that it was your amazing subconscious book-radar that led you to your purchase, not a pretty cover. It has enough of the regular markers of the genre to make it a comfortable read but it is told in such a fresh way with very original twists that make it completely new and enjoyable. Yelena's is a world you will not want to leave. The story continues at full speed through the sequel Magic Study which tells a very new tale but still upholds the quality of the first. The third book Fire Study should prove to continue this tradition upon its release."
1335,"Poison Study (Study, #1)",0778324338,Maria V. Snyder,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Librarian-Next-Door,"This is still, since I read it last year, one of my favorite stories. I read a review on it and gave it a go, with trepidation. ""ANOTHER magic book...well, okay,"" is what I opened the book thinking. The next few hours went by without my knowledge. I eventually had to apologize to my family for neglecting them, and again, when I was grumpy because I didn't get a wink of sleep that night. When people tell me something is THAT fantastic, I am almost always disappointed, because I build it up as something amazing in my head. So I say this hoping that doesn't happen to you, ""Read this book. You'll be better for it. I was not disappointed."" If you need to fall in love with an idea, a character, a thought, a rather hot hero, then this series is it. It will inspire you to be more brave and take chances in your own life."

i was very much looking forward to this book and after reading some reviews, i was a little worried i wasn't going to like it...It was wonderful! you truly get into V's head, his background, his parents. you get more of an understanding about the Scribe Virgin and her Chosen. i feel V truly does get his happy ending, (witch some say was wrong) but if was the only way for him and Jane to truly be together forever. you can't always have your cake and eat it too. there are many surprises in this book which get you ready for Phury's book. so don't let other reviews turn you away for V's story. it really is one of the best (next to Z's) and i recommend every BDB book! these brother's have stolen my heart!"

Touching, Romantic & Thrilling all get 5 stars from me! So touching and so sad in so many ways. I actually cried reading this book. The life that V started out with, having the Bloodletter for a father. The guy lived up to his name that's for sure. And finding out who his mother is (I'll not say here, so you'll be surprised) and finding that after all his years with his father, dreaming of a loving and caring mother, then to be sooo let down. He goes through so many emotions with his best friend, Butch, then finding the love of his life. This book has so many twists and turns. Some of them will make you want to cry for him, cheer for him, and hope for him... and at some points you'll hold your breath for him. This is my favorite book so far in the BDB series, but then again, V has been my favorite character from the beginning. Don't worry about some of the other reviews that are upset with the ending to this book. It's about love and sacrifice and that life isn't always fair and it's all how you interpret ""Happily Ever After"". I can't wait to read the next chapter which is Phury's story!"
1337,"Going Postal (Discworld, #33; Moist von Lipwig, #1)",0060502932,Terry Pratchett,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Guest,"The hero, or at least main character, is clever but not egoistical, unwilling but not running away, fraudulent and yet with some ethical standards of his own.  Long-time Discworld fans have been commenting that, for the last few years, the series has been getting 'dark', heavy-going with very serious social issues (war, torture, dictatorship) (which I think is what satire is for, satire is social commentary wrapped in humor).  'Going Postal' deals with the slightly lighter issues of the enslavement of Artificial Intelligence (golems), the downfall of a major government office (the Post Office), serious financial fraud, unsafe work environments, and the thoughts of the employees.  This novel, however, seamlessly incorporates the requisite humor.  Readers new to Discworld may find this book more enjoyable than if they started the series with the two previous books 'Night Watch' or 'Monstrous Regiment'.  Old time fans who have felt 'Night Watch' to be too bloody and psychological, or 'Monstrous Regiment' to be too grossly humorous while treating the subject matter inadequately, might have a happy nostalgic trip with 'Going Postal'."

I'd only read a few of Pratchett's books before but I liked his style and decided to give it another go on the bus ride home.  

The book starts out, continues strong, and ends funny yet insightful.  Many of the jokes are dark but they add to the tone of the book.

While it's not the sort of thing that would hold up in a book club discussion, there aren't a lot of brilliant insights, it's a wonderful book for a Saturday morning or a bus ride, it'll keep you laughing and certainly interested."

Few writers can make an autocratic tyrant a noble character, but that is the charm of Terry Prachett's novels. The heroes come from unlikely sources and the characters, even the minor ones are always engaging send-ups of ""stereo-types"" that go beyond the typical stereo-type."

Sound like a creepy story line? It's better than that. Stephen King, the ""Master of the Macabre"", creates some truly out-of-this-world creatures that lurk in the mist. But....he makes the atmosphere inside the store almost as dangerous as the outside by adding in some human pandemonium. It's all about adaptability. Some people don't cope well and start to lose it. The most fearsome by far is the witch-like Mrs. Carmody preaching the end times and expiation. She believed in a biblical reason for the mist. Others suggested The Arrowhead project, a government preserve outside of town. Whatever is behind the mist, it's classic King!"

The Mist by Stephen King was a 5 star action packed horror novel that just keeps on getting more interesting the more you read. This book is great if you enjoy scary, creepy, or just plan weird events. This book kept me guessing as to what would happen next, the whole time I was reading it. There is never a slow part in the whole story. This book deals with how people will react to post-apocalyptic events, it shows how people will pick a leader in that type of situation no matter how silly this leader maybe.

It gets you peeking out the windows at night wondering what that noise was. It just plain gets you. Excellent! What I always expect from Stephen King, and what he never fails to deliver to me, a sense of comfort knowing my favorite author still enjoys making us scared, and I love him for the endless hours of fear, anxiety and the unexpected laughs he has given to me.

1340,"Dead Beat (The Dresden Files, #7)",045146091X,Jim Butcher,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"Harry is REALLY getting on my nerves.  His constant whining, his ineffectual attempts at magic, his idiotic propensity to champion the wrong women; it's enough to drive a regular reader insane.  And the worst is his constant insistence that he is very powerful.  Yet, somehow, every villain simply kicks his butt, until some act of god, or rescue by a friend, or sheer happenstance  lets him survive.

I just like my heroes a little mor heroic and less bathetic.  I get the whole concept of a flawed hero, but really, you can take this premise too far, and Mr. Butcher does, on a regular basis.

That said, this outing is well plotted and full of interesting action.  Well worth reading.  Just don't try rereading the series in one big gulp like I did, or you too will be rooting for the villains to finish ol' Harry off, once and for all.  Yes, he's that annoying in large doses."

5 Stars!

I am completely in awe of Pierce Brown after reading this book. Seriously, where did this guy come from? I was blown away by his debut novel, Red Rising, and had hoped that this book would be just as good. I think that this book was actually a little bit better than the first book in the trilogy if that is even possible. It is so refreshing to read a follow up novel that exceeds all of my expectations.

This is the kind of book that hooks you right away and never lets go. Even after turning the final page, I found that I want the rest of this story. This book picks up not too long after the events in Red Rising. Hardly any time is spent rehashing the events of the first book which could be problematic for readers who read the first book nearly a year ago since there is so much going on in this series. Since I had just recently finished the previous book, I jumped into this story quite easily. This is not a series that you can jump in just anywhere and not feel lost so please be sure to read the first book before starting this novel.

There were a lot of politics in this book and I found that I really enjoyed all of the complex political maneuvering. Politics are a large part of any change in society. Darrow navigates his way through all of the plotting and plans of others in ways that nobody expects. The things that he does often seem risky and foolish but he is almost always able to pull his plans off.

The characters in this book are amazing. Many of the favorites from the first book are back in the second. We also are introduced to many new characters. I really liked Servo in the first book but I fell completely in love with him in this installment. He is rude, funny, loyal, and most importantly a true friend to Darrow. I also really liked Lorn's character in this book. He has seen and done it all and his wisdom and experience really aided Darrow. I like that Lorn respected Darrow but was never afraid to tell him when he was unhappy with him.

Darrow finds himself at some very high points during this book but he also finds himself in some of the most dire situations. There were so many jaw dropping moments in this story that I lost count. I never knew which way things were going to go and how the power would shift. I must say that the ending of the book really left me wanting for more. I wouldn't call it a cliffhanger ending exactly but I would say that there are a lot of unresolved issues as this installment came to a close.

I received a copy of this book from Random House Publishing Group - Del Ray Spectra via NetGalley for the purpose of providing an honest review."
1341,"Golden Son (Red Rising, #2)",0345539826,Pierce Brown,Barnes and Noble,4.8,tpolen,"While reading Golden Son, I felt as if I were in a vacuum - nothing existed outside of this book - it was that captivating.  Darrow's story is both heartbreaking and horrifying and he performs some monstrous acts to accomplish the overall goal, but I was always in his corner.  He's as charming as he is wily and had some tricks up his sleeve that were pretty surprising.




To say this book is full of action is an understatement.  The body count is quite high, copious amounts of blood are involved, and some of the killing are very inventive, so it's no wonder there's such an extensive list of characters in this series - you obviously can't kill the whole cast.




Which brings me to my only issue with Golden Son.  I read Red Rising almost two years ago and with such a large number of characters, I had difficulty remembering them and what they'd done.  A short summary of the first book or character map would have been helpful.




The world-building is just extraordinary, the characters deep and fascinating, and the storyline full of battles, betrayal, and power struggles with a little humor and romance tossed in.  The Red Rising Trilogy is easily one of the best series I've read and you won't find a sophomore slump in Golden Son.  You don't want to miss this.  




This review is based on a digital ARC from the publisher through Edelweiss."

I literally could not put the book down! I cried, I laughed, I cursed and even when I might have had an idea of what was to come, I was blown away by the twists and turns of this story. I eagerly await not only the third book in this series but any and all books to come from this author. An amazing, exciting and stunning read!"
1342,"Night Watch (Discworld, #29; City Watch, #6)",055215430X,Terry Pratchett,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Raven on LibraryThing,"This is not a subject on which there's ever likely to be much consensus, but for what it's worth, Night Watch is my favourite Discworld book, and is probably up there in my top ten of books ever. Its plot, its structure, its characters, themes and humour, are all just right for me, and I'm in particular awe at how the whole thing coheres. In the beginning, Sam Vimes is commander of the City Watch and Duke of Ankh, and this is the day that his wife, Sybil, gives birth to their first child - and by the end, these things may or may not still be true, but we've got there through time travel, History Monks, bloody revolutions and a hard-boiled egg. Through a magical accident, Vimes is thrown back into his own past, it's not a very nice place, and the rest is a sort of history. There are no loose threads, and nothing happens that isn't crucial or relevant, but the perfect execution doesn't have anything of the mechanical about it - the progress of events is a natural consequence of the characters and their motivations, and in the end it's just right. I've heard people criticising this one as not a ""real"" Discworld novel, lacking in humour and the usual fantasy elements, and I will concede that in some ways it's atypical: for one thing, it's not a parody. It does share themes with, say, Les Miserables, but it doesn't parody them in the way that, say, Maskerade parodies The Phantom of the Opera. The humour definitely comes from within: from Vimes's wry sense of humour, from the History Monks (which, okay, do have an element of James-Bond parody about them) and mostly from the inherent absurdity of the People's Republic of Treacle Mine Road. So, I suppose, the humour is necesarily darker, but the fantasy - the wizards, the time travel, the dragons and magic - is still there, just, well, in the Discworld it's real, so it's taken for granted by the narrative. Like I said above, it all just fits together.And Vimes carries it all very well, but I do like the rest of the cast. The Watch really only cameo - Carrot, Angua and Cheery appear only before the timeslip - as do the wizards. We do get to see young Nobby, young(er) Colon, and young Vetinari, who is worth the price of admission all by himself. Vimes, both young and old, is a constant presence, but the book doesn't disappear all into his head, which it might well have done in less capable hands.In conclusion - this is the one where you might accuse Pratchett of literature. Which is a foul slander to say about an author you love, but there we go."
1342,"Night Watch (Discworld, #29; City Watch, #6)",055215430X,Terry Pratchett,Barnes and Noble,4.5,yossarian_lives,"CAUTION: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS.
   Few avid book-readers can actually say that they've come across a book they can truthfully call their favorite, but I am privileged to claim Night Watch as my personal favorite.
   Terry Pratchett is a genius. Night Watch is a story of a copper who's based his career on all that he learned from a rigid and right-minded sergeant when he was just a lance-constable. Sam Vimes, the copper-in-question, grew up to become Sir Samuel Vimes Commander of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, and a hard, yet honest watchman, at that. When our story begins he's having a bit of trouble with the fact that as you rise in rank, you fall in actual street-work. Priding himself on the ability to know where he is by ""the feel of the cobbles through the soles of his boots"", he misses just being a copper. This conflict between the dangerous life of a cop and the boring life of being a diplomat is intensified by the fact that Vimes' wife, Lady Sybil, is giving birth to Vimes' firstborn. Vimes is following what Pratchett terms as ""the call of the chase"" when a freak storm (mixed with a bit of Discworld magic) transports him and a psychopathic killer, Carcer, back to the days of his youth. Upon arrival, Carcer kills Sergeant-at-Arms John Keel (the aforementioned ""rigid and right-minded.) This leaves young Sam with no mentor to keep him from following the corrupt ways of policemen in Times Past. So, Vimes, caught between the joy of being in the Night Watch again and the longing to be back home with his wife in the future, adopts the name John Keel in order to teach his young self how to be a copper. During this period Vimes-as-Keel leads a ragtag bunch of men through the Glorious Revolution, commemorating Keel as a hero. At the end of this battle, Time snaps back in place taking Vimes and Carcer with it, leaving History to believe that the hero died in battle. Once back in the future, Carcer is incarcerated and dealt with according to the law by Commander Vimes, just as Sergeant Keel would have wanted. The 25th of May (the day of the fateful battle) is from thenceforth known as The Glorious 25th of May, and in the future the graves and names of the men that died there are honored. Having saved the day once again, Vimes returns to his home and his wife and his newborn son, Young Sam.
   All of that being said, I do not, however, recommend Night Watch as a starting point for newcomers to the Disc. Terry Pratchett has a unique writing style, and I fear you will not fully appreciate the book without a good knowledge of this style and of the disc. Should you be looking to start this series, Guards! Guards! is a fantastic place to begin."
1342,"Night Watch (Discworld, #29; City Watch, #6)",055215430X,Terry Pratchett,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"This is the first Terry Pratchett book I've read and although I'm only about a third of the way through, I am almost giddy with tears that not only do I have two thirds of this book left to read, but apparently many, many others in the land of 'Discworld'.  I love the humor and appreciate that some of it actually poses remarkable insight into human nature and other reality.  Character development is superb and I very much want to see what happens to them.    I must have been living right lately for God to hook me up with so many books to look forward to.    Thank you, Mr. Pratchett!!!"
1343,"The Light Fantastic (Discworld, #2; Rincewind #2)",0061020702,Terry Pratchett,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Ruriksson,"The Light Fantastic is a bit of an odd man out in Terry Pratchett's Discworld series in that it's the only one that really should be read in order. Most of this fantastic series can be read as a stand alone, in whatever order one feels (odd in and of itself for such a large series). The light Fantastic is the followup to Pratchett's Discworld debut The Color of Magic, in which our erstwhile hero Rincewind continues his journey with the Discworlds first tourist, the indomitable Two Flower. It is every bit as offbeat, witty and strangely poignant as the first, and certainly a good start to one of the most interesting fantasy worlds ever created. Highly recommended."

In my opinion, What the Dog Saw is a clever way to gain insight on information that Gladwell calls ""adventures;"" a collection of 19 articles placed into three specific categories: minor geniuses, theories and predictions. I am not usually intrigued by social science or psychology... I am, after all, a senior in High School who prides myself on being an ""abstract thinker,"" ""creative,"" and an ""artist,"" but surprisingly Malcolm Gladwell took particular topics and articulately portrayed experiences with a tone of great excitement and curiosity for the subjects, which allowed me to continue reading the book with an excited anticipation. I understand the arguments from people who had previously read Gladwell's articles in The New Yorker; it was nothing new. But for those craving a logical book filled with facts, and a bit of passion, it was refreshing, to say the least."
1344,What the Dog Saw and Other Adventures,0316078573,Malcolm Gladwell,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Booknut62,"I have read with pleasure Malcolm Gladstone's books ""Blink"" and ""Outliers"" with fascination and interest and with level of intensity that made those two books quite enjoyable. I did not have the same experience with ""What the Dog Saw."" It is not the same. Perhaps Gladstone's attempt to cobble together old columns and writings just does not work for me. I found reading this book and getting through it an ordeal. I always finish a book even when I am not particularly enjoying it. This one bordered on being painful to get through. Then again, it could just be me. I am not a fan of short story books either. Some of the topics addressed by Gladstone were interesting such as the opening chapter about ""The Pitchman,"" but that interest and intensity of writing is just not sustained throughout the whole book. ""Outliers"" and ""Blink"" were thought-provoking, engaging, and fascinating, but this one never rises to the same level. There are books that I would call not very enjoyable, but a worthwhile read. I am sorry to say that I just can't call this one a worthwhile read. I'm afraid this one was one of those published with the hopes that because of Gladwell's previous successes, it would see success as well. I am sure it has sold well, but this is one of those books that can make you not want to read any more by this author."
1344,What the Dog Saw and Other Adventures,0316078573,Malcolm Gladwell,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Henry_Boyer,"I enjoy books and articles that give me a bigger picture of the world.  Malcolm Gladwell does it with prose that is both faced paced and substantive.  Many people will suspect that these reprinted articles from the New Yorker are just a way of cashing in on previous successes, and they may well be, but they are well worth the read.  These insights into human nature and experience, giving us the real story behind people and events, are perhaps the only real truths available to us.  ""What the Dog Saw"" spoke to me on both emotional and intellectual levels in a very satisfying way.  Light, enjoyable reading that informs and inspires is a big part of what good writing is all about.  I enjoyed his earlier book, ""Outliers,"" in much the same way.  But here the greater variety of subjects, each presented with sufficient depth that never bogs down, was even more insightful, expanding and encouraging. With the constant deluge of bad news, and with the winter chill freezing us out even down here in Florida, Malcolm's writing is a fresh, warm and fragrant breeze.  I looked forward to reading ""What the Dog Saw"" in the same way I look forward to getting together with good friends.  However, this book always fit into my schedule."

1347,Revival,1476770387,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Anonymous,"Stephen King has been my favorite author for over 2 decades. I've read just about everything he's published, some novels multiple times.
I've been wanting to read 'Revival' since I read a summary of it last spring. I purchased this the day it was published and before long I was totally engrossed in its story.
The book starts by making the reader care about the  characters and creates a need to know where their stories will lead. 
Unfortunately, the last few chapters become tedious and the ending feels thrown together. Almost like SK had something different in mind, but changed his mind at the last minute and just came up with this instead.
I gave this novel 3 stars because (1) it's Stephen King and I'd read his grocery list if he published it and (2) the begining and middle of this story was just so well done.  
Bottom line: if you're an avid SK fan, give it a try just to say you did. Otherwise, skip this one."
1347,Revival,1476770387,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,3.6,JULIANN1,"This one was troubling, though perhaps not in the way King intended. As with so many others, I have been a fan forever, since 1981 and The Stand. While I think King's books are uneven, they are always a class act, and I would follow him anywhere. I was sure the reviews that gave the ending of Revival such a hard time were wrong this time, but having finished the book last night, I have to concur. Until the denouement, I loved the book and it's careful pacing. The great reveal at the end, however, was just sub-par. Not frightening, not fleshed out, not interesting, and certainly not convincing. I was hoping for something more Hieronymus Bosch&mdash;detailed and varied&mdash;instead of a sketch of a line of dead people not even brought into focus. I hate writing this. 98% of it was so good with great potential."

It read like something my eleven year old might come up with. Completely ridculous and just awful. Can't really elaborate without revealing spoilers. It was like SK got stuck at the end and threw in some absurd idea from a bad dream. Very disappointing!

I think it is the best book in the whole series (though you should read them all). It's captivating, enthralling, brilliant, thrilling, and just down right hilarious. It may have a lower level vocabulary, but it's characters are just as charming and witty as a master like Shakespeare or J.K. Rowling. The characters are brilliantly developed, and completely realistic. No fake, unbeleivable personalities here. The plotline is complex, full of brialliant twists and turns. Just as you think you've figured it out, Patterson takes you around another bend, and your theory is blown to pieces. But, sometimes books have exciting plotlines in some parts, and boring areas in others. Not Maximum Ride. It's a must read all the way through, from the first page to the last. It may be a fantasy, but it has some very real topics in it, from global warming, to a teen's crazy love life, to an obsession over choclate chip cookies. It's wonderfully written so that you enjoy the fantasy, wish-it-were-you feeling, but also see the real issues portrayed in the book. The characters and emotions are so believable, sometimes you feel it could really happen. I'm a teenager, and I feel exactly as Max does when she's tumbling through her adventures. From her happiness and her excitement, to her confusion and fear, I feel as if I know her, and understand what she's going through. I understand why she does things, or why she doesn't. Basically, she (and the rest of the Flock) are totally beleivable characters. The plot flows with excitement, created by exploding buildings, on-the-fly fights, and an interesting love twist, and the characters are amazingly well developed, creating an all together great book. What more could anyone want?"

Right now i'm currently reading the fourth out of five. I really like how I can relate to Max, and how that when James Patterson writes it's not always about the same exact thing.

Enjoy Winter, because it is the kind of book that can be read a million times in a row, and you will still find new quotes to smile about and more moments to remember."

I wanted to review the story before I went.     I was really happy that I read the book as it gave me great insight into the plot of the production.

1356,"The Warded Man (Demon Cycle, #1)",0345503805,Peter V. Brett,Barnes and Noble,4.4,NickyRay,"The Warded man is another hero's journey of a boy who is thrust from the womb of his home and into the terrible reality he lives. This novel follows Arlen, Leesha, and Rojer, each following similar coming-of-age arcs, jumping years, until they finally converge near the end of the book. Structure is good, but you must stray from it to keep things interesting. The story almost turns into Dune while Arlen is in the desert, but thankfully Brett decided to stop there, and instead give Arlen a Edmund Dantes-esque return as the titular Warded Man. There are some funny bits, some sweet revelations of the good in the hearts of some lowly characters and the action was often bloody and thrilling, but overall the inner story of the characters was flimsy, and Arlen essentially becomes the Batman of his world. 

Brett's prose would have gotten me flayed in school, he almost entirely tells instead of shows, often repeating the obvious multiple times in the same paragraph, then having the dialog repeat it again, never allowing for subtext. He bashes the reader over the head with the apparent, yet neglects details like describing what the demons actually look like until quite a few chapters in. The world that he created feels more like a rough sketch, which would work with a cast of strong and complex characters, but those are missing here. 

Another odd and bothersome aspect of this book is the constant examples of rape, incest, and molestation that permeate the story. About every other chapter has the characters in some conflict with sexual predators, or their own juvenile sexual issues. Particularly Leesha, who in the story is so beautiful that she turns any man alone with her into a drooling rapist. Well written, this may have lent itself to the complexity of the story, but it was not well done. This aspect was clumsy, predicable, and left me cringing more than once, and actually less interested in the character's fates. By the end, it felt like a heavy handed attempt to shape Leesha's and the others characters, but failed to do so. 

Certainly not the worst fantasy you could pick up, but if you want a well done, gritty, fantasy, check out Joe Abercrombie and the First Law series. Or just a great, original fantasy book, try The Name of Wind by Patrick Rothfuss and see how it's done."
1356,"The Warded Man (Demon Cycle, #1)",0345503805,Peter V. Brett,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Angelle,"I received this new novel by Peter V. Brett a couple days ago from Del-Rey for review and so I decided to sit down from my few months being a mom to read it. I was so glad I did. The Warded Man is an intense ride that begins with the lives of three young children that through different diversities survive to fight on in a world where just the corelings or demons aren't the only things that should be feared. 


In this well written novel, you will meet Arlen, Leesha, and Rojer, each set on their own path by tragedy or by the evil of others. Their journeys are all thwart with different types of danger from One Armed demons to the evil of greedy men. Each one will have you wrapped around their stories as they pull you from the world you know into one that nights are feared and demons roam only to take you into that darkness never to return. 


The Warded Man is a well put together novel. With intense actions scenes that do not rob from the brilliant dialogue, the beautiful, yet, horrifying imagery literally engulfs you in a world that is filled with mountains, deserts, wall cities, and small villages. Each chapter brings you deeper into the shadows filling your mind with visions of small fire demons to the large stone ones. 


I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves good fantasy and great action. It is a bit on the dark side with some violence to kids as well as to grown ups so please use discression when looking at it for kids younger than sixteen or so. Other than that, I implore you to give Mr. Brett a chance. I know I will be reading the next in his series for sure....."

1357,The Pilgrim's Progress,0486426750,John Bunyan,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Beasliffe,"The book is excellent, but the folks at B&N should be embarrassed to offer this badly scanned nook book edition. Notes and marginal comments appear in-line in the same font as the text and interrupt the flow of reading. Words are sometimes split randomly or shift in their middle between plain and italic. Words that should be bolded aren't. Poetry is set as prose at random. Apostrophes are mis-scanned as question marks. Apparently no one bothered to proofread the scan results. The editorial notes also detract from the text on which they are supposed to comment. since they are often trivial and sometimes plain wrong. This is truly a sorry transfer from text to ebook and unworthy of Bunyan's masterpiece."
1357,The Pilgrim's Progress,0486426750,John Bunyan,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Jess_MacCallum,"There is a reason this book has not been out of print since it was first published in the late 1670s.  It remains relevant. One of the most insightful and honest descriptions of the Christian Life, far better than modern writers can even come close. It is the quintessential Christian allegory, ahead even of Chronicles of Narnia. 

Brilliant insights, life-changing."
1357,The Pilgrim's Progress,0486426750,John Bunyan,Barnes and Noble,4.2,John McAllister,"Though an exhilirating tale of adventure and grandiose excitement if epic proportions it is still so much more than that.

1358,"One Shot (Jack Reacher, #9)",0440241022,Lee Child,Barnes and Noble,3.7,kevin-hal,"This truly was an awesome read.  The story starts out with a sniper gunning down five people  leaving work in a small Indiana city.  Although this act of violence was so random, the police  managed to track down the killer very quickly to an ex-soldier named James Barr.  The evidence was perfect against him.  Without a doubt, this man is guilty, or is he?  His few words before falling into a coma, "" They got the wrong guy...Get Jack Reacher for me.""  Lee Child takes you into the mind of Jack Reacher, an experienced and skilled retired soldier.  Jack Reacher, being one of the few that know of Barr's violent past, is prepared to do what ever it takes to expose the truth. 

This book has absolutely nothing to complain about and is possibly one of the best books I have ever read.  You never know what Reacher's got planned next or how he's going to take down his next victim.  In other words, you would not want to mess with this guy.  All in all, a fantastic book which I definitely recommend to all readers in search of a thrill."
1358,"One Shot (Jack Reacher, #9)",0440241022,Lee Child,Barnes and Noble,3.7,MavOR,"I read two Child books in a row:  this one and ""Nothing to Lose"".  the second book is one of his most recent, with an irritatingly political slant; my advice to Child is get back to his earlier formula for the Reacher novels.
""One Shot"" is a great crime thriller with good character development for a genre that is primarily sock 'em, pop 'em plot development.  I especially liked the firing range owner, Cash, with his ex-Marine attitude and laugh out-loud exchanges with ex-Army Reacher.  
An encouraging note to those who have not read Child:  the violence is somewhat explicit, but the sex and language is tasteful and restrained.  Child at his best relies on clever plots and a truly unique protagonist."

Duma Key was his first book to take place out of the New England area.  If is not my favorite book written by him but it is in my top five after The Stand, IT, Green Mile and Dreamcatcher.  Duma Key is one of those books I would read until I had to put up because I was ready to fall asleep.  Just a great, great book."
1360,Duma Key,1416552510,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Kasia_S,"Ahh... what can I say about Duma Key, other than it being an extraordinary experience, a literary breath of fresh air, a masterpiece of color and texture without any actual paint being used. I guess there are some people out there think it's boring or long but I instantaneously felt a bond with the book and I can say that I absolutely loved it! The writing itself was so colorful and interesting that I enjoyed each and every page, there was in no rush to get to the ending by any means, but I did like the end, it matched the enigmatic feel of the story and it had a lush, tropical feel to it but it was tainted by something dark and eerie and quite frankly very creepy because it was deadly. Those affected could have never imagine their demise, and whether they believed in it or not, it was coming. I was attracted to this book right away, partially because of the cover; it always begged to be read and as an artist it touched my sensors in ways that kept me thinking of it often so I finally had to sit down and read it and also because one of my best friend who started reading it and I had to follow suit so we could enjoy and discuss it together, it as a real threat to read it at the same time and marvel at the unfolding story.

Edgar Freemantle is a handicapped man who moves to a mythical island of Duma Key, a place that doesn't exist in reality but seems more real than half the vacation spots I've been in. He rents a salmon colored house and starts painting with his remaining arm, paintings that change his life - at first for the better but later he realizes that his new found gift is very hungry, and it hungers for things most precious to him. His recovery seems to progress until he starts feeling his missing arm, at the same time strange storms are coming to the island and things that shouldn't be real are happening, Edgar knows that his paintings have more power and meaning than he could have ever imagined and it's up to him to solve the mystery that has enshrouded Duma Key for generations and left many skeletons during it's rein. The story jumps off the cliff with an appearance of a ship on the horizon, Edgar knows that its not good news, something strange and deadly is on that ship and the closer it gets to him during those storms the stranger the hold on his sudden artistic talents and the results are quite shocking, but hey they make for great reading. After reading it I can safely say that it's one of my favorite books ever, I even got the hard cover version so I could have the full dust jacket with it's glorious art to see while I read the paperback and carried it with me everywhere. This might not be for everyone, but that's totally fine with me, I loved it and it made an impact on me, I'm sure there are people out there who wont like it, and that's fine, It only makes me feel lucky that I'm not one of them!

This story is like an exotic fruit bowl, gorgeous from every angle and full of mouth watering rainbow of flavors. The characters in this tale are extremely realistic, from the kooky and zany to mysterious and deadly, each plays a part that paints such a grand picture that the more I think about it the more I feel the need to read it again, just to dip back into that pool of ""ahh.."" it creates.. It's really hard to explain but this book was marvelous and it made a bond with my imagination, one that will stay with me for a long time. There is plenty of original mystery and horror and love and growth combined with"

In order to truly like this book, you must enjoy a good story. Good stories aren't always filled with suspense and drama. The ending is a wonderful one but sometimes to enjoy the end you must know the beginning. The majority of the book is allowing you to get to know the characters, their relationships, and this is what makes the ending so emotional & satisfying. This is a spectacular debut from a new author who is able to allow us to see the past through the memories of an older woman. We see life through the eyes of a service girl dedicated to the lady she works for. A girl who kept a secret her entire life and finally shares it with the reader. It's been a long time since I felt such emotion after finishing a book."

1362,"Winter's Heart (Wheel of Time, #9)",081257558X,Robert Jordan,Barnes and Noble,4.4,GeraldTarrant,"For the most part, I think I liked WINTER&rsquo;S HEART, even though this book, more than any so far in the series, seemed to embody the strengths and weaknesses of THE WHEEL OF TIME.

By the time this book came out, people had already begun to turn on the series a bit, criticizing Jordan for making a money grab and stretching out the series as long as he could and filling his books with more and more characters, more and more world-building, and less plot advancement. In WINTER&rsquo;S HEART, Jordan moves the plot forward in a few places, but does so in as bizarre a way as any author I&rsquo;ve seen.

I don&rsquo;t want to spoil anything for those who haven&rsquo;t read this book yet, so if you don&rsquo;t want any spoilers at all, please stop reading this review. If you don&rsquo;t mind vague spoilers, I&rsquo;ll do my best to be non-specific &ndash;

One of the series&rsquo; main female characters learns she is pregnant during the time period depicted in the book. &ldquo;During the time period depicted in the book?&rdquo; you might say. What a strange way to phrase that!

I word it that way because Jordan doesn&rsquo;t actually include that part in the book. In fact, we spend probably eight to 10 pages in that character&rsquo;s POV chapter before she mentions that she&rsquo;s pregnant in passing, and that&rsquo;s why Character A gets this, this, this and this for breakfast, Character B gets this, this, this and this for breakfast and she gets this, this and this to eat because she&rsquo;s pregnant. I&rsquo;ve honestly never seen anything like it. By the end of WINTER&rsquo;S HEART, Jordan is nearing 240,000 words in this series. He has been roundly criticized for packing too much into the story, detailing every minute detail of his character&rsquo;s lives, putting 100,000 words or more between major plot developments, and somehow we know everything the characters eat for breakfast on a daily basis but we aren&rsquo;t there when one of the main characters learns they&rsquo;re pregnant.

It&rsquo;s totally bizarre.

For the most part in this series, even in the books I didn&rsquo;t especially like, I&rsquo;ve liked the way Jordan ends the book with a rip-roaring fight, usually between Rand and one of the big bads. This time, Jordan does an excellent job of setting up the big fight. Rand is busy using so much magic that he can&rsquo;t defend himself, and he must rely on those around him to defend him from the Forsaken descending upon him. It&rsquo;s great.

Jordan speeds up the pace, jumping from POV character to POV character, and we see the battle beginning from probably eight different characters&rsquo; points of view. But then we jump to another character on the outskirts of the fray who wants nothing to do with the dangers of battle. They can&rsquo;t see anything, but they guess that the Forsaken are probably losing.

Of course, we can&rsquo;t trust this because one of Jordan&rsquo;s favorite games is to have a POV character express an opinion that&rsquo;s wildly inaccurate, but in the next scene the battle is over and we&rsquo;re told who lived and died. Somehow, Jordan spends all this time building up to this fight, and as good guys and bad guys run into each other, he cuts away just as the fighting begins. It&rsquo;s as though Jordan hates the reader, and is now just taunting them. You want something to happen? Fine, but I&rsquo;m not going to show it to you. I&rsquo;ll just tell you everything that happens before and then skip over the exciting parts.

Mat Cauthon is back for this book, and seems to get the bulk of Jordan&rsquo;s attention. I have to say, Mat has really grown on me again. I struggled with him in some of the early books, but Jordan has certainly found his grasp of this character, and I was happy to spend more time with Mat as he makes his way in Seanchan-controlled Ebou Dar. I just wish his plot had moved forward more.

Perrin&rsquo;s determination to find his wife, who was kidnapped in one of the earlier books, is gripping early on and I expected to see him try to chase down her kidnappers, but Jordan soon drops this plotline and never returns to it.

Having Rand spend the bulk of his time with Min is a good choice, as Min has been one of the few female characters Jordan hasn&rsquo;t made off-putting. I also liked seeing Rand working with Lan, even though they follow a red herring plotline where they walk into a trap set by a big-time bad guy, but then the big-time bad guy runs away almost immediately, making the whole thing kind of pointless.

Jordan is still creating more mysteries for the readers to try to figure out, and while he does answer others, they&rsquo;re questions that were set up in the third or fourth book of the series. Sometimes he pulled out the big reveal, and instead of saying, &lsquo;Wow, that&rsquo;s amazing!&rsquo; my response was, &lsquo;Oh yeah. I&rsquo;d forgotten about that.&rsquo;

So here I am, nine books into the series. Jordan seems to have a better grasp of his main characters than he did earlier and he has found ways to make some of them more interesting, but his pacing still isn&rsquo;t quite right and some of the storytelling decisions he made in this book were downright strange."
1362,"Winter's Heart (Wheel of Time, #9)",081257558X,Robert Jordan,Barnes and Noble,4.4,ChristineEveryday,"The review earlier that commented that they thought Robert Jordan would die before giving us the end was a very offensive review.  For the record, Robert Jordan did pass away, may he rest in peace, but he made arrangements prior to that for the last story to be written.  He created such an amazing fantasy world and he cared enough about the story AND the readers to see to this.  His books are so colorful and full of life; other fantasy books have just two aspects to them-we're good and they're bad; let's use magic and dragons to deal with it!  In the Wheel of Time series you have fantasy and also the aspects of actually living in that world.  Robert Jordan will be missed and I am sad that I will not be able to look forward to any more by this amazing author."

The story was funny, dark yet positive, and overall very intelligently put together. One of the most captivating things about this book/author is that scenes, people, and objects are laid it in such smart detail that it felt as if I was watching a movie of the book in HD with special effects and all. I could literally visualize ever magical event with no difficulty as I read. Excellent story to match too! I really think this book should be made into movies for an adult ""Harry Potter"" like series; it would be much better. Bucher made a fan out of me."

At times I would laugh at out loud at the madness of his logic, while other times I would be dumbfounded by his incredible line of thinking and view on the world/life.Very few books make me question the way I think/rationalize like this book succeeded in doing.The second part is a story of the underground man, showcasing his thoughts/actions from his journal in story form. I found this part to be a tad boring and drawn out, but interesting as it still held the same logic from the first part.Overall, its verbiage is tough to read depending on the translation you get, and you have to pay extremely close attention - I had to re-read things multiple times to 'get it.' But this is not a book that you just want to finish, you really do want to 'get it.'

In an interview, the author, McCullers, stated that the form for this book is inspired by a musical form,the fugue. A fugue contains a single motif or several motifs that are repeated over and over again throughout the piece. In the novel, the motif is loneliness which is acted out by the central character John Singer who is deaf and mute. The other main characters, Biff, Mick, Dr. Copeland, and Jake struggle with their individual form of loneliness and seek out Mr. Singer who, ironically, is the only person with whom they can communicate and the only person who also understands them. Set in an unnamed Georgia Mill town, the novel opens up a door to another time and place where attitudes towards people with disabilities, different religions, different ethnicities,and surprising political views are dramatically different from today. Published more than 70 years ago, this book is worth taking a look at in 2013."

overall it was a decent book. worth reading once i guess, but definitely not one i'd be likely to pick up again. it had it's moments where i couldn't put it down (towards the end) and then moments where it literally made me want to take a nap after about 10 pages."

It is a rarity for sequels to outdo the first book in a series and I think this was the case. This book had a little less action than the first but I liked it because it foccused more on deatails and the thought process of the charactors. I have a comment for the review on the violence and language. Compared to other young adult fiction the language was not that bad. If somebody killed the whole world your not going to say, ""I really did not appreciate that you just slaughtered my entire family."" Even myself, having never uttered a single swear word would have cussed. Additionally, the violence isn't so bad. In comparison to Divergent and the Hunger games it isn't any more gory. I am not going to live the rest of my life scarred. I reccomend this book."

1368,"Small Gods (Discworld, #13)",0552152978,Terry Pratchett,Barnes and Noble,4.4,dmboyett,"What I love about Terry Pratchett&rsquo;s disc world series is you don&rsquo;t have to read them in chronological order to enjoy them. Each book is a story unto itself but fitted into the context of that wonderfully quirky place called disc world. Of all those novels my favorite is Small Gods because to me even though it is a satire on conventional religion it is also profoundly theological. Reading it has given me a better understanding of my own religious tradition and its context in this complicated place we call Earth. I would recommend this book to anyone who believes in God, doesn&rsquo;t believe in God, or addresses their prayers to Whom It May Concern."

When I was in 3rd grade I had to do a big author study project, I picked Christopher Paul Curtis because I liked the book, Mr. Chickee's Funny Money. Picking this author was the best decision I have ever made in my life. He is the greatest author ever, not kidding. Now, two years later I still continue to read his books, I am reading The Watsons Go To Birmingham for the 2nd time right now.If you are a kid between the ages of 8-12, and you have not read this book, do me a favor and read it. Pick it up from your library, or buy it, because I guarantee that you will want to re-read it. One moment you will laugh, the next you will be in tears. Parents and Grandparents, holiday shopping can sometimes be hard, but here;s a great stocking stuffer for you! I love getting books in my stocking, it's really great.  This book is great for that, it gives kids info about orphans and what some people go through, but also the love that gets discovered in this book. In my family, we have a family book club that consists of me, my grandparents and my great grandparents, on my dads side. The book club formed, when I recommended this book. It brought us together, and I hope it will for you too. Don't be discouraged by all the negative ratings, like BORING, or EASY. These things are true to some people, people who don't open there hearts to the struggles of Bud. This review was written by a 10- year old girl, not a parent who heard about the book from their kid, not from a older kid who thinks their grown up. This was written by a true kid who likes what other kids like and loves books.If you don't believe me or want to believe those other negative reviews, that's fine but I cannot express how bad that decision is to pass by this book, it is a must read and will bring your family together. A Perfect gift for the holiday season. :) Happy Holidays everyone!"
1370,Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic,0618477942,Alison Bechdel,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Jackie2794,"I was recommended Bechdel's Fun Home by a former English teacher of mine. As a fairly avid reader, I was excited to see what this book had to show me. They say you shouldn't judge a book by its cover, but I couldn't help but to be captivated by all of the praise and awards on the memoir's front and back cover as I initially looked it over. To my great dismay, the book ended up being kind of a disappointment. I have nothing but the utmost respect for Bechdel - her honest writing style and literary knowledge are both interesting and impressive, but the memoir simply did not resonate with me. I don't really know what to think of this memoir; there were aspects of the book that I really loved, and other aspects that were hard to sit through, but there was nothing about this memoir that I found to be particularly gripping. I will say that I am extremely impressed with the amount of hard work that went into this memoir. The graphic novel layout (drawn by Bechdel herself) is aesthetically pleasing to the eye and really shows how arduous it must have been to create. Bechdel's story is so well thought out that it is obvious that she has spent a lot of time preparing herself to write this memoir. My biggest disappointment with this memoir was that I found nothing enticing about Bechdel's story. I think Ms. Bechdel told her story of her troubled past with her father to have closure with her upbringing, as opposed to appealing to her readers. I didn't find this book to be extremely funny or extremely sad, it was a monotonous read, which is fine, but I was really looking for a gripping memoir similar to so many that I have read before. All in all, I would say that Fun Home is a story that is either hit or miss for readers. I think that many will enjoy Alison's story and appreciate her quirkiness, but others will simply just not see what all the hype is about."
1370,Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic,0618477942,Alison Bechdel,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"I was introduced to this book by my former roomate who grew up not too far from where Bechdel grew up and where most of the book takes place. At first I was weary of a graphic novel but I was enthralled by her use of elevated language and literary comparision. Each time I read it I find something new, if not within the text then the pictures themselves. Her novel peeked my interest in her other works and have become a Bechdel fan. I had the pleasure of meeting her and I must say she is a woman of great intelligence and is suprisingly humble. I would agree that this book is not for everybody. But those with open minds able to appreciate a non-tradtional book with an equally different story then please by all means go forth and enjoy this book!"

1371,Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions,006135323X,Dan Ariely,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Guest,"¿Do you know why we so often promise ourselves to diet, only to have the thought vanish when the desert cart rolls by?¿ This question is one of several asked by Dan Ariely in the introduction of his recent book ¿Predictably Irrational.¿ He subsequently states that ¿¿By the end of the book, you¿ll know the answers to these and many other questions that have implications for your personal life, for your business life, and for the way you look at the world.¿ An equally tantalizing statement follows in which the author describes how a set of events in his childhood cemented a life perspective that is quite different from 'and presumably more insightful than' your average person. Together, these preliminary contents set the tone for some high expectations. What follows, however, is a mildly interesting, sometimes trite, and often oversimplified set of observations and `clever¿ experiments that come across more as products of extensive free time than brainchildren of a truly deep thinker.        While some disappointment stems from the ambitious prologue, a rudimentary problem with Ariely¿s thesis lies in the set-up. He starts early with a summarized definition of classical economics, which surmises that we are all rational and, in every day life, compute the value of all options we face and then select the one that maximizes our gain. Any action we take that is not in our best economic interest, therefore, is irrational, and as Ariely opines, surprising in its very nature. But while rational behavior of participating agents may be the basis of economic theory, very few people spend any time thinking about this theory other than economists. For the rest of us, there is no question and certainly no surprise that our social and economic behavior can be irrational, and we have countless reminders of this every day. We know that too many options can diminish returns 'chapter 8'. We also know that expectations often shape our perceptions 'chapter 9', and nobody doubts the allure of free merchandise 'chapter 3'. At the conclusion of each chapter, then, the reader is left with someone else¿s reinforcing account of what he/she is already aware of.          Whereas related offerings such as Tim Harford¿s ¿Undercover Economist¿ or Nassim Taleb¿s ¿Fooled by Randomness¿ offer technical and less-tangible insights into topics such as economics, behavior, and probability, ¿Predictably Irrational¿ relies too heavily on the concept that the author¿s perspective is deeper than our own. This leads to a distillation of complex psychology 'not to mention biochemistry and evolution, among others' into oversimplified explanations and human trials involving free beer. In the end, one is left with the feeling that the author himself is much more interesting than anything uncovered by his experiments on college kids."
1371,Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions,006135323X,Dan Ariely,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Guest,"I enjoyed reading the book but now that I think about the examples and experiments discussed in the book, I find most of them flawed. So I wondered why I did not catch the flaws when reading the book. I now realize it was because Dan (the author) either cleverly manipulates the readers or he is just a natural at it and does not realize that he is manipulating the audience. So I will reserve personal judgement against him, whether his style is purposely or just inadvertently manipulative. Afterall, he claims to be expert in behaviorial science so I can easily imagine that the book and the manipulative style are an experiment that he is conducting to see how people respond.     So without further ado, let me begin.     His very first discussion is about his personal experience with a tragic severe skin burn, which led him to question how people perceive things and how they rationalize their behavior. In writing about his own experience he draws the reader's sympathy - i.e., he gets the readers off-guard into a sympathetic and trusting mode, whereby they immediately admire him for overcoming his tragedy and delivering great research to the mass audience. Very clever, Dan!     Throughout the book he mentions MIT, Harvard, Berkeley as the places where he conducts research and that he had an offer to be at Stanford - he cleverly drops names of prestigious research schools all in an attempt to create an impression that his work is rigorous. I sub-consciously gave him a pass while reading the book, but now I feel I was duped.     Here are some flaws with the examples and/or experiments he discusses:     1) He suggets that perhaps our ethical compass is coarse - i.e., for most people the compass does not respond to petty theft they commit but does respond to large scale theft they might contemplate but not commit to  -- like not stealing a carton of pencils but willing to steal one pencial from the stationery room. First of all, we don't steal a pencil from a store but we do take from our workplace -- so clearly it is not about the number of pencils but rather the context where the pencil is to be had.    I claim we take a pencil from work without paying for it in cash but not from a shop because we can compensate the firm by working a little harder or longer and at the same time avoiding the transaction cost of purchasing a 10 cent pencil at a store or by trying to compensate our employer with 10 cents in cash.     The reason people don't steal the entire box of pencils is because they don't need so many pencils all they need is one pencil. Dan suggests that people could be honest and purchase it at a nearby store for 10 cents. He ignores that going to the store and then paying 10 cents for a pencil also comes with a large transaction cost, which is a pure deadweight cost which can be easily avoided by just taking the pencil from the office. The social welfare is greater if one just takes the pencil instead of imposing a transaction cost on the owner and on oneself. Even leaving 10 cents with the secretary at the firm entails a huge transaction cost for the firm.  Therefore, it is better to just take the pencil.     Furthermore, our compass works just fine, even for petty stuff, when others take a pencil. Thus, our compasses do in fact respond to petty conduct.     By the way, I would take a pencil from work even when the secretary or the boss is observing me. So I don't think Dan has seriously thought about this issues even though he seems to think he has.    2) The experiment about selling a football ticket (which was won in a lottery) and about buying a ticket is also flawed. The reason why the ticket winners wanted $2400 for their ticket was probably because that was the 'going' price for the tickets in the secondary (scalpers) market, just before the game. And, the reason the students who did not win the tickets in the lottery were willing to pay at most $170 or $175 (he reports two different numbers) is because that is all they"
1371,Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions,006135323X,Dan Ariely,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Guest,"Predictably Irrational is an exceptional book on a number of fronts.    First, from the writing style, it is absolutely accessible and that isn't always the case when academians convert research into a book designed for the mass market. This book is as accessible and interesting to read as Freakonomics was.    Second, this is the first book to do such a thorough job of connecting psychology, human behavior and economics.    This book should be an immediate read for every marketer, salesperson, CEO or non-profit without exception.    When you read this book you'll learn about how you and I make decisions and if you are honest you'll recognize yourself over and over in the reading. You and I make decisions the same way everyone else does. And, as a marketer, a salesperson, a funds solicitor for a non-profit, we'll make more, get more and achieve more to the extent that we leverage these automatic processes.    Most people don't fight or even acknowledge their own decision making processes, they just go through the process. What they think is control is really an illusion as this book so clearly points out. You and I can and are regularly influenced subliminally by the way information is presented.    The chapters on Free and the chapter on The Fallacy of Supply and Demand are invaluable. Ariely's explanation of price anchoring will change how you think about MSRP or even your intitial pricing discussion in sales. His experiement using the last two digits of your social security number is very eye opening. This is also an example of something very easy for you to test in your own marketing organization or social group.s    Interestingly, where at the time of this review we are facing a recession, I find this book essential reading for those who would change the face of the recession as well as the duration.    It was interesting to me to read some of the negative reviews of the book but most of them focused on wanting to challenge the conclusions without reading all of the research papers. And, I didn't see many of the people who were critical provide the level of observational credibility that Mr. Ariely does.    This book just made it to my desktop library, the 10 books I'll refer back to again and again when I create marketing material, influence strategies or consult with clients.    This book is a powerful read."
1373,"The Indian in the Cupboard (The Indian in the Cupboard, #1)",0007148984,Lynne Reid Banks,Barnes and Noble,4.4,caleb_h_WV,"This book is about a boy named Omri and he an Indian and a cupboard for his birthday. Some of the characters in the story are Omri, Patrick, and Omri's two brothers. Omri puts the Indian in the cupboard overnight and then in the morning he heard something in the cupboard and he opened it and he saw the Indian alive. Omri keeps it to himself that his Indian came alive overnight in the cupboard. He builds Little Bear a longhouse to live in. He takes little bear and his horse outside for a ride. Little bear gets hurt outside and then Omri goes inside and he brings the chief alive so he can help Little Bear. Then the chief dies and then little bear takes charge of being chief. Omri didn't want to tell anyone about his cupboard turning plastic toys into real toys. His friend Patrick who gave him the toy and one day he slipped out that he was real. Patrick didn't believe him that he was real and then Patrick wanted to go to Omri's house and see himself. Omri took him to his house to see. When Patrick saw it he wanted one then. Omri didn't want him to have one because he was afraid that Patrick would tell everyone. Omri had to go downstairs for his mom. When he came back up Patrick had made a cowboy real. There is a good ending to the book but ill let you read the book so you can see what the ending is. Now you know some things about the book The Indian in the Cupboard. If you chose this book I hope my review as been helpful to you."

Yes, it was small for a book for a teenager like myelf to read, but it was still very good. It had a lot of emotion and tension, and proof that everyone is important and special in their own way. I want to find the publishers or Lynne Reid Banks, or whoever decided to have the British to American words dictionary. I hate it when you read a book with British people, and you can't understand any of it. This is a good book to read if you need to do a report for school. Overall, I think anybody between the ages of nine and fourteen would like this."
1373,"The Indian in the Cupboard (The Indian in the Cupboard, #1)",0007148984,Lynne Reid Banks,Barnes and Noble,4.4,will18,"The book The Indian in the Cupboard by Brock Cole is a great book that takes place in the 1930s. Here are some events from the story. For Omri's birthday he got a cupboard with a key that can bring plastic to life. Omri brought a plastic Indian to life named Little Bear. Little Bear wanted to make a longhouse so Omri got him some supplies to make it. Once he makes it Omri's best friend Patrick finds out about Little Bear and gets really jealous so he found a plastic cowboy and brought it to life and his name was Boone. One day Omri decided to bring Little Bear and Boone to school, he gave them both to Patrick and he put them in his pocket but he tripped and thought he had killed Little Bear and Boone. Omri took them after that and went to art class and Boone drew a picture so small that the art teacher was amazed and she thought Omri had drawn it. Late at night Omri and Patrick decided to watch a movie about cowboys and Indians, the cowboys were winning a fight so Little Bear got so mad and shot Boone with an arrow. In the morning Little Bear was complaining because he really wanted a wife, so they went to the shop and bought a plastic Indian to bring to life, but when Omri got home he could not find the magic key and he found out it was under the floor boards because his dad had changed the floor boards. Omri sends down Little Bear to get the key but there is a rat! Down there! The Indian in the Cupboard has some positives and some negatives. One positive is that Omri brings a plastic Indian to life, that is positive because that makes the book very exciting. Another positive is that Omri's friend Patrick really wants to bring a toy to life so he puts a cowboy in the cupboard, I liked that because Little Bear would now have a friend his size. One last positive is that they could not ell anybody about Little Bear or Boone. One negative thing in the book is that the brought a toy doctor to life to help Little Bear get healed, but they did not show the doctor that many times. I also didn't like that Patrick told the principal about the toys because it ruined their secret. Lastly I think they should have made Little Bears wife speak more because she only spoke once or twice. The writing style of the author is very interesting. This book is very easy to read. The author (Brock Cole) uses 1st person. 1st person makes the book better because if the author told the story then you might not understand Omri's feelings that well. Most of the words in this book are very easy to read. All of the topics that Brock Cole writes are very clear. This book has some recommendations and some not recommendations. I would recommend this book because it is very interesting how Omri brings a plastic Indian to life. I also like how Patrick brings a cowboy to life and it becomes friends with Little Bear. I would also not recommend this book because the whole book is pretty much in Omri's house. Here are some similar novels to this book. They are actually all in the same series, the 2nd book in the series is called The Return of the Indian, the 3rd book in the series is called The Secret of the Indian, the 4th book in the series is called The Mystery of the Cupboard, and lastly the 5th book The Key to the Indian. The Indian in the Cupboard was a great book."

The language is vulgar, but not too terribly distracting, since you're reading from first person perspective. I found myself laughing out loud when reading this book. I was reading quotes and passages to anyone who would listen. Although this book has a character that has Leukemia, this is not the main story line. It's more a story about a boy's journey in discovering himself during his senior year. I did tear up at the end, but I cry watching Hallmark commercials. I enjoyed Greg's character, and yes you wanted to smack him around a couple of times, but guess what...that's what helped build his character's story. Was it profound? No. Was is didactic? No. What is WAS...was wonderful! Could this book have been better? Sure...but I think I like the fact that it wasn't very heavy-handed. Take a chance and read this book.

Upon the recommendation of the  bookseller at BN, I decided to purchase it in the hopes that I would be able to share it with my students.
Unfortunately, while the premise of the novel is amusing and the characters are mostly likeable, I found some of the content to be more adult in nature than I would feel comfortable with in regard to my students. Granted, they've all probably read, said,seen, etc., words or phrases like this before but I feel recommending this book as their English teacher would be rather inappropriate.

Sure, it's great for the highest of readers, too, and that's what a great author does. Similar to the Harry Potter series in that it appeals to a large group of readers, all the books were funny and dealt with humorous issues on so many levels of understanding. Funny for the 8-year-old and equally funny for the 13-year-old. I have a lot of trouble finding books for my 9-year-old son and he is very picky. This will be a sure hit. Another book I'd recommend to those of you in my situation would be ""Did You Ever Wonder"" by Brendan Lynch. It's one of those humorous books that my son loves.

1378,"The Professor and the Madman: A Tale of Murder, Insanity and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary",0060839783,Simon Winchester,Barnes and Noble,3.9,cookiepam,"I love Winchester's slant on this topic - I was not particularly interested in reading either book - my mother kept bugging me to get them, then she finally got them for me.  Of couse, she was right, and I was wrong.  I was delighted by Winchester's quirky slant on the history of the OED.  I had never heard any of the human stories about the compliation. I will now never be able to pick up an OED without thinking of the people who created it.

I am surprised that the Barnes & Noble rating categories do not allow me to rate the book on: research, writing and intellectual stimulation.

....  did you know that the OED continues to take submissions for new words, and new uses of words?  I think that this is a perfect example of intellectual stimulation."
1378,"The Professor and the Madman: A Tale of Murder, Insanity and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary",0060839783,Simon Winchester,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"The subject of Winchester¿s book is Sir James A. H. Murray, editor of the 'Oxford English Dictionary,' and Dr. William C. Minor, the American volunteer who worked on the 'O.E.D.' for 20 years while an inmate in the Broadmoor Lunatic Asylum for the criminally insane. I am a New York playwright who, in 1995, completed a full-length drama focusing James Murray and William Minor, called 'The Dictionary,' and whose help Mr. Winchester sought when he was first considering writing his book. 'Winchester mentions me in his Acknowledgments.' There is a serious problem with Winchester¿s book. Mark Rozzo characterizes it perfectly in his 'Washington Post' review of 'The Professor and the Madman': '. . . we¿re never sure when Winchester is cleaving to facts and when he is fictionalizing.' Winchester also missed some significant information in his book. Moreover, there are a number of inaccuracies in 'The Professor and the Madman.' About Minor¿s death Winchester writes, incorrectly, 'There were no obituaries.' An obituary was published in 1921 in 'Yale University Obituary Record of Graduates Deceased During the Year Ending July 1, 1920.' From this obituary one learns that Minor was born in the East Indies  that he entered the Yale School of Medicine in 1861 and was graduated in 1863  that he was incarcerated at Broadmoor, transferred to St. Elizabeth¿s in the U.S., and later transferred from St. Elizabeth¿s to The Retreat, in Hartford, where he died on March 26, 1920. The Yale obituary also mentions his brother Alfred. Winchester refers to the lawyer who defended Minor in his murder trial, but does not mention the lawyer¿s name. My research suggests that the person who defended Minor is the same one who defended Oscar Wilde. The man¿s name is Edward Clarke. I am surprised that Winchester did not seize upon this possibility. Winchester theorizes that Minor¿s clinically paranoid dread of the Irish, and of the Fenians in particular, was the result of his experience as a Union Army Surgeon with Irish troops during the Civil War. Winchester neglects the fact that during the years that Minor was stationed in New York 'on Governors Island' the Fenians were, in fact, his real enemy. Minor lived in New York during 1867 and 1868, when the local papers frequently covered events pertaining to the revolutionary movement in Ireland and to activities of the Irish in New York. In March of 1867 the Irish cause held the front page of just about every newspaper every day. It was during the week of March 18 that the expectation of a Fenian attack on Canada, still part of the British Empire at that time, appeared in at least three separate articles in three different papers. News of U.S. troops being moved from New York to the border to thwart the offensive also made headlines. That Minor would have been selected to assist in the battlefield action against the Fenians is not unlikely. This attack never took place  however, less than a year before, the Fenians had staged an assault on Canada from New York State. Eight hundred Irishmen crossed the Niagara River and captured Fort Erie. They were subsequently defeated by U.S. troops, and about 700 Fenians were arrested. Minor would have known of this. Winchester mentions the American vice-consul-general and quotes a letter of his to the Medical Superintendent of Broadmoor, but neglects to cite his name, which is Joshua Nunn. Winchester also failed to locate a series of twenty-two letters by Joshua Nunn, an important source of information regarding Minor. The letters to Minor¿s family and friends in America contain particulars that conflict with some of Winchester¿s assumptions regarding Minor¿s life at Broadmoor and his relations with his family. Joshua Nunn clearly went beyond the call of duty in his assistance to, and profound concern for, Minor. Nunn was the man who handled all the details of Minor¿s legal situation as well as Minor¿s living conditions at Broadmoor. He was also very involved in the press account"
1378,"The Professor and the Madman: A Tale of Murder, Insanity and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary",0060839783,Simon Winchester,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"I never realized how much work was needed to make a dictionary or any reference book at all, until I read The Professor and the Madman.  This book has a good explanation on how the Oxford English Dictionary, the most complete dictionary of the English language was started.  Now that may not make for a very interesting story, but the events that took place, and the people involved with this historical event are interesting.  The story is told somewhat slow, and may not make for a very easy read because of it, but the book picks up and becomes much more interesting when you learn more about Dr. Minor and James Murray.    	The tales of Dr. Minor make for a very interesting story alone.  Dr. Minor lived on the island of Ceylon until he was fourteen, when he was sent to live in New England.  He went to Yale and became a surgeon, and served at the Battle of Wilderness in 1864 where his mental problems most likely started.  At one point he had to brand Irish deserters during the war which contributed to his dementia later in life.  After looking at some information Dr. Minor I found one thing that the author left out.  At one point in the book the author wonders how Dr. Minor could have had such knowledge on dictionaries, but he contributed to The Great American Dictionary before moving to England to try to recover from his problems.  	The theme of the book is the making of the Oxford English Dictionary, and the tale of schizophrenic Dr. Minor and James Murray.  I liked reading about the doctor and his problems  it was an interesting topic, though Murray¿s wasn¿t as interesting there are several details that make for a good read.  The parts about the history of the Dictionary before Minor was involved weren¿t too interesting, but it was somewhat necessary.  One other thing that made this hard to read was the fact that it is a very hard book to read if you don¿t have a very big vocabulary.  There are a lot of seldom used words for everyday vocabulary, and many I had never heard before.  I would recommend this book to anybody who is interested in reading a history of the Oxford English Dictionary, and the impact it had on the time period or just tales of mental problems."

1381,"The Eyre Affair (Thursday Next, #1)",0142001805,Jasper Fforde,Barnes and Noble,4.1,LinusRenee,"When I first picked up The Eyre Affair, I had no idea what to expect, other than friends saying I would love it. Well, they were right!
Jasper Fforde creates this amazing world of a very strange 1980's England, where the door-to-door proselytizers are Baconians, trying to convince you that it was Francis Bacon who was responsible for the works under ""his pen name"", Shakespeare. Oh, and time travel is a matter of fact, the Crimean War is still being waged, and dirigibles are the way to travel the sky!
The story woven in, around, and because of this world had me hooked pretty quickly. Mixing my knowledge of literature with this topsy-turvy world of literary detectives, Fforde captures the imagination and doesn't let it go!
Before I finished reading it, I went and bought all of his other works. It's become the first book I suggest and the one that I haven't stopped talking about yet! Go read it!"
1381,"The Eyre Affair (Thursday Next, #1)",0142001805,Jasper Fforde,Barnes and Noble,4.1,yoop,"When I first heard about this book, I was intriqued by the plot concept.  I have so many books that I have unread at home but the plotline was compelling me to buy yet another book.  I absolutely love Jane Eyre and had actually just read about half of it prior to picking this book up.  As I began to read this story I was amused and drawn to the characters first by their creative names and then by their quirkiness.  I found the lead character Tuesday Next to be believeable and interesting so I had no problem moving right through the book at a quick pace.  What I found the most amusing was the melding of science fiction, a bit of romance, fantasy and good ol humor mixing it up!If you are a fan of classic literature you will appreciate the story line.  I would highly recommend this book.  I think it would be a super fun book club selection when you get bogged down in serious literature.  It was a breath of fresh air for me!"
1381,"The Eyre Affair (Thursday Next, #1)",0142001805,Jasper Fforde,Barnes and Noble,4.1,LitElephant,"A wonderfully clever novel -- this is definitely something any lit-nerd out there should look into! Though I think Fforde could use some work on his pacing, ultimately his plot was inventive, funny and exciting and the world that he writes is extremely well-created. Thursday is engaging, and not too feminine-- male readers could also relate well to her, I'm assuming. I'm looking forward to picking up the next one in the series!

The characters keep him interested and engaged.  The comedy of each special ""wayside"" situation provides lots of conversation points with my favorite six year old.  The writing is easy enough for him to practice reading the lines of each character, and the situations silly enough that we make it to the end of the chapter laughing!  Some of the content might be edgy for some parents, so it is important to read the content in advance so you are prepared to answer questions about a smelly rat or the pulling of braids.

1384,The Art of Happiness,1573221112,"Dalai Lama XIV, Howard C. Cutler",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"This book is suppose to represent the Dalai Lama's views on happiness. Readers should know right off the bat that the Dalai Lama didn't actually write this book. Rather, the book is written by a Western psychiatrist who has had extensive converations with His Holiness. To insure that there were no ""inadvertant distortions"" of the Dalai Lama's ideas as a result of the editorial process, the Dalai Lama's interpreter reviewed the final manuscript. You be the judge as to whether that means this there was nothing ""lost in translation"". So who is this Dalai Lama, aka ""His Holiness"" anyway? And, why should we read a book about happiness by him? Well, the Dalai Lama is the spiritual and political leader of the Tibetan people according to Tibetan Buddhism- which in my book makes him a person I'd want to listen to when he talks, especially when it's on one of my favorite subjects, happiness. And if this all sounds like an interesting topic for a book, you should read it- you won't be disappointed. Now this is the kind of book I could write a long review of- simply because there's just so much wisdom packed into it. But, I think I'll take a short-cut with this one and just hit the highlights. The Dalai Lama believes that the very purpose of our life is to seek happiness. Other happiness books have also taken this same position. For example, the book ""Finding Happiness in a Frustrating World"" refers to happiness as ""the ultimate pursuit"". On this most will agree, but what exactly does the Dalai Lama tell us about finding it? As with most of his ideas on things, the concept is clear and simple: happiness can be achieved through training the mind. According to the Dalai Lama, one begins by identifying those factors which lead to happiness, and those factors which lead to suffering. Having done this, one then sets about gradually eliminating those factors which lead to suffering and cultivating those which lead to happiness. That is the way. To that end, that's exactly what makes up the majority of this book's pages- ways to eliminate factors in your life that lead to suffering, and learning to foster those factors that lead to happiness. Some specific topics include: -facing suffering -dealing with anger, hatred, and anxiety -building self-esteem -deepening your connection to others When all is said and done, I'd have to say that the time you spend mulling over the book's 300-plus pages is going to be well worth it. For most readers, the Dalai Lama's wisdom and views will probably be very beneficial, if not transforming. Happy trails!"

I had the idea that seeking happiness was ""bad"" - making other people happy was ""good"".  But now I know that if I seek to be happy (as opposed to seeking pleasure) I will automatically do good for other people.It didn't disappoint or bother me at all that it was written by someone else as the words and ideas were clearly those of the Dalai Lama."
1385,The Bone Clocks,1400065674,David Mitchell,Barnes and Noble,3.4,Angie_Lisle,"I love Mitchell's writing; the man certainly knows how to turn a pretty sentence. This book is formatted similarly to Cloud Atlas, with six nested parts that collaborate to move the plot forward, and what I stated in my review of Cloud Atlas holds true for this book as well: when you think of this book in outline form, mind-boggling. Then, that outline gets weighted down by words.

And I felt the weight of this book even more so than I did with its predecessor.

I started out high on Holly Sykes in 'A Hot Spell.' I fell absolutely head over heels into the first part of this book. Then, I hit the second part of the book, 'Myrrh is Mine, its Bitter Perfume,' and that crush ended fast. Juxtaposition is the only reason I can come up with to explain such a droll section. I read 'A Hot Spell' in one day but it took a week to get through 'Myrrh is Mine, its Bitter Perfume' because I despised the main character, the pretentious narcissist Hugo Lamb (after this section, I returned to the schedule of reading one section per day). I briefly wished that I could pop into the story just to slap Lamb around a couple times. And by slap, I mean palm strike to the forehead with enough shoulder-backing to throw the little d-bag back on his egotistical behind. I celebrated reaching the end of this section. Seriously, I sprung for expensive craft ale.

The third and fourth parts, 'The Wedding Bash' and 'Crispin Hershey's Lonely Planet,' dragged with verbose meanderings that wander off-point and convey small amounts of information pertaining to Holly. The future that's coming later in the book is set up here, with Mitchell showing readers what parts of the real world shape his future world. But, half the fun of a fantasy is the escape from the mundane real-world and it's the lengthy delivery of these details that matters after finishing the next two sections, 'An Horologist's Labyrinth' and 'Sheep's Head.' Especially 'Sheep's Head,' set in the year 2043, which has a back-story chock full of all kinds of amazing events that we never read about because Mitchell chose a brief telling of events during conversation rather than showing us - which wouldn't bother me if the third and fourth parts had been delivered in the same manner.

However, I loved the way Mitchell ended this book. I even like the way he wrapped up Hugo Lamb; it felt like an apology for making me want to hit Lamb so bad.

I received a free advanced reader's copy of this book from First Reads in exchange for a review."
1385,The Bone Clocks,1400065674,David Mitchell,Barnes and Noble,3.4,Anonymous,"Good writer, but ill be hesitant to read another by him. Lots of seemingly pointless info; the plot i picked  up the book to read could have been told in 40 pages. Another reviewer said it best ""mostly empty calories"". If he writes a book with full calories id read it for sure; but i didnt even read the end of this one, nor will i have the desire to. I do like his writing, just not in pointless bulk.  I like how he portrays peoples thoughts, its very real. Maybe i missed the point, searching for the paranormal aspect."
1385,The Bone Clocks,1400065674,David Mitchell,Barnes and Noble,3.4,Books4Tomorrow,"Spanning a time period of about fifty-nine years, The Bone Clocks is a captivating and highly stimulating read. The story follows Holly Sykes from her teenage years, through numerous paranormal encounters, to her old age when she tries to make an existence in a disintegrating world.

Although this lengthy novel provided me with five days of intense reading, I can truly say that it was worth every minute. Apart from the beautifully written prose, I loved the well chosen bits of well-known poetry and prose from popular works quoted at appropriate places in the story.

The characters are masterfully crafted, fleshed out and absolutely lifelike. Holly Sykes, the main character, starts off as a rebellious teenager who runs away from home simply because her mother disapproves of her boyfriend. Throughout the book she shows growth until, at the end, she is a great-grandmother in charge of young children in a near-apocalyptic setting. 

Other remarkable characters include the womanizing, thieving student, Hugo Lamb aka Marcus Anyder, a bestselling writer with a serious grudge, and Ed Brubeck, a father who tries to convince himself that he isn't a war-zone junkie. Then there are the mysterious body hopping Immacul&eacute;e Constantin and the strangely reincarnating Marinus; both of whom are hugely paranormal. The question is: which of them is really the bad guy in this tale?

The Bone Clocks presents the most believable end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it scenario that I've ever encountered in a book. It is so logical and realistic that the Endarkenment, as it is called, turned out to be the scariest part of the book for me. 

For an engaging read with tons of action, brilliant characters, and a completely captivating storyline, I recommend The Bone Clocks as an absolute must-read! (Ellen Fritz)"
1386,Black and Blue,0385333137,Anna Quindlen,Barnes and Noble,3.8,sweetpeaSP,"This one starts where most end. This is the study of the aftermath of Fran leaving Bobby, an abusive relationship... of her not as a victim, but as someone struggling to rebuild her life. The fact that she stayed in the marriage as long as she did is completely believable, and is evidence of the fact that smart women sometimes make wrong choices. Her struggles are realistic and both joyous and frustrating, as she discovers herself in her new-found freedom. Here's the story of why women stay in these horrible relationships, so often because of the cost of escaping. The story goes back and forth between the present and the past, to show the reader the gradual, inch by inch way the abuse begins and escalates and how her self-confidence and self-esteem are destroyed until the woman fears for her life. This is both heartbreak and triumph, and emotional without being depressing. This is more interesting than you might think. I thoroughly enjoyed it. 

Another book I'd like to recommend, kind of on the same wave length about a woman's spectacular triumph over abuse. This one will have you crying one minute and laughing and sighing the next....EXPLOSION IN PARIS....WONDERFUL emotional experience!"

Yes, in some minds it could be called a reality check, but for myself and other parents, it's the unthinkable. I couldn't get this book back to the library fast enough this morning.

1389,Diary,1400032814,Chuck Palahniuk,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Jodi_Ann_Hanson,"I really enjoyed this book. Chuck Palahniuk's protagonist Misty writes in a diary to her comatose husband Peter, detailing their lives and the current happenings on Waytansea Island in case he comes around.

Peter's coma is the result of a failed suicide attempt. While he is in the coma Misty learns of hidden rooms in the homes he has recently renovated. Each of the rooms is covered with graffiti of Peter's anger and warnings to the inhabitants. She is called to each home and threatened with lawsuits by the owners. At the first of these occurrences Misty meets a fellow named Angel who seems to take an interest in the graffiti and ensconcing himself into Misty's life.

Soon strange things begin to happen to Misty, she begins having horrible headaches and finds herself in a trance-like state with the only thought in her mind being painting. She is pushed by her mother-in-law, daughter and the residents of the island to paint every time she is in their presence. She is compelled to pick up her paintbrushes and spends weeks locked in an attic room of the Island's historic hotel painting with such a fervour she forgoes eating and wears a catheter so she won't have to leave her work. Once she is done she has created 100 paintings that are all part of a large painting she has never seen that is to be revealed in an exhibit for the summer people which flock to the island.
 
With the help of Angel, Misty uncovers a tradition to replenish Waytansea's wealth by bringing a female artist destined for greatness to the island by marriage to one of their sons. The son gives his life as a sacrifice which is the catalyst for the process to begin. The one thing the inhabitants of the island don't count on is that Misty's husband Peter is homosexual and Angel was his lover and the confidant of his disdain for the tradition and also the man Peter is intent to run away with.

The book comes to an end with a final twist the reader doesn't see coming. Chuck Palahniuk proves once again what a talented writer he is and will continue to be thrilling the reader in a way no other can."

I couldnt wait to get out of work just to read this book, The Diary. I highly recommend it to people who just enjoy a good read. It keeps your interest, and keeps you guessing. Palanuick has such a way about his writing, that makes it hard to put his books down. His imagination is truly inventive. If you have never experienced Mr. Palahnuick I suggest you go out and buy one his books. if i had to describe his style I'd say blunt, outlandish, and at times can be a little twisted."
1390,"Eleven on Top (Stephanie Plum, #11)",0312985347,Janet Evanovich,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"The Stephanie Plum series is all about the romance. The relationship aspects of the series are the parts that the author plans out two to three books ahead of time. The rest of the story follows where she wants to take the relationships book to book. Sounds like more of a romantic comedy than a mystery series. The author will keep rolling out these books and her fans will keep eating them up. Why mess with a winning formula? I used to wish that the author would take this series further, stretch her creativity and talent and bring back some of the freshness that made the Stephanie Plum novels and characters so original. But I haven't seen anything new for at least half the series and now don't expect anything but more of the same each time I read. They're still entertaining but no longer exciting. Too bad. It used to be such a sassy series. Now it seems more lazy then anything else."

1391,"Inkspell (Inkworld, #2)",0439554004,"Cornelia Funke, Anthea Bell",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"I loved Inkspell. It had love, pain, and fantasy blended together perfectly so that the reader would see and feel what was happening to the characters.  You could picture the hatred in Mortola's eyes, so deep that you could get lost in it, as she hurt Mo, feel Resa's giddiness when she realized that she had her voice back, and then her pain as she watched her husband get shot, and smell the Inkworld air as if you were standing there next to the characters.    	In this sequel to Inkheart, Orpheus reads Dustfinger back into the world that he came from, leaving his marten, Gwin, and his faithful companion, Farid, behind.  Farid then runs to Meggie, who reads him into Inkworld and at the same time did something never accomplished before-she read herself into a story.  She left a note for her mother and father, who then had someone read them back into the story.  When they get there they find out that Mortola had followed them, which is when she shot Mo with a rifle from their world.  Meggie hears word that her father is hurt, and panics.  Will he survive?  	This book is an amazing sequel to another amazing book.  I liked this book even more than Inkheart, and I couldn't put either one down.  It may be slightly difficult to read at times and the length was intimidating, but it is even better than the one before it, and it's worth it.  You cannot read Inkspell and fully understand it without reading Inkheart first.  I would recommend these two phenomenal books to anyone that enjoys reading stories about adventure, magic, and fantasy."

But, I wanted to know how the story ended.  So, I finally picked this one up.  I'm very glad that I did.  The story was much richer than the first book.   It was written better with the characters coming to life more.  Maybe it's because we finally get a look at the world that everybody was willing to go to such lengths for.  It's almost like the author was able to write about a fantasy world better than the real one.  I found the danger more real and the bad guys gave off more of that evil persona.  I was just overall more impressed with this one.   Believe me, I will be picking up the last in the series soon!"
1392,"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto",0743236017,Chuck Klosterman,Barnes and Noble,4,NerdFighter_92,"Have you ever eaten Coco Puffs? I bet you didn't realize the sugary cereal you were ingesting was original conceived by the ideal to help prevent ailments or that there commercial maybe unintentionally teaching you how to be cool. If you did realize it is likely you are either: A. Chuck Klosterman B.  Simultaneously a sociologist focusing on media and a breakfast historian or C. person that has already read the book Sex, Drugs and Coco Puffs. 

Chuck Klosterman Is a writer for Spin and Esquire magazine. He is most prominently known for his work about classic rock bands but also has an almost infinite amount of cultural knowledge that makes SD&CP a very enjoyable collection of essays. Because of the fact that it is essays and not s story SD&CP should be a very easy book to pick up and put down, but I actually found it was not. His insights make him seem genius and the different perspectives he offers are as addictive as Cinnamon Toast Crutch.

Despite my plethora of cereal related references SD&CP is about far more then breakfast with themes that cover everything including The Real World, The Sims, Say Anything, and Vanilla Sky and few others that it is unlikely you could think of in your wildest dreams.

Usually The stories lack focus on the thing itself and look at a broader theme represented by the item, and while these are all only Mr. Klosterman's opinions even if you disagree they are very entertaining. The most common criticism of his work is his writing style that at sometimes seems intentionally overly wordy. I had no problem with it at, but I could defiantly see the potential for it to become annoying.

On the whole I found the book to be a very entertain and thought provoking, but would not recommended it to someone who wants a story but rather for someone who is interested in both reading random facts and learning to think differently."
1392,"Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs: A Low Culture Manifesto",0743236017,Chuck Klosterman,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"I had to stop reading this about 1/3 of the way through. The author comes across as very self-centered and obnoxious. A friend of mine recommended it because it was ""hysterical and made you think"". It made me think ""how long until this is over"". I had to call it quits and give up."

1393,Brideshead Revisited: The Sacred and Profane Memories of Captain Charles Ryder,0316926345,Evelyn Waugh,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"Charles Ryder is a character a lot of young people today (like myself) can relate his skeptisism, if not disdain, for the professed beliefs of his Catholic family. Through a series of relationships each slightly deeper than the last he ultimately seems to find that the object of his affection in any relationship will not quench some innate human desire and so it must be cast aside for a more difficult but deeply divine relationship with the God he so disdained. Interesting because in today's world as perpetual students we continuously question all aspects of life in search of sensibility rather than the sentimentality that Charles originally assumes faith to be. Hmm..."

It is beautifully written...the prose is of another time, when conversation was carefully considered. If you want your novels to have a conversational tone reflecting the 21st century, it is not for you.

The Everyman's Library books are beautifully made, fit wonderfully in one's hand, and are very affordable. I don't know about you, but I can't stand the feeling of a paperback (mass markets particularly)."

There isn't any other series that I've read yet that is worth 24 books to its name like this one. It stands out from the crowd and while may start out a little slow the first 25 or so pages, once it picks up speed it won't let you put it down.. simple as that. I stayed up til four in the morning finishing this book, and it was worth every minute. The characters are perfect, along with their flaws and personalities. They all feel like they have been fully fleshed out by Butcher in a way that only he could. If you are debating whether to get this book, don't think about it, just do it.."
1394,"White Night (The Dresden Files, #9)",0451461401,Jim Butcher,Barnes and Noble,4.7,brjunkie,"The best Dresden Files book since ""Summer Knight""!!! When helping Chicago's SI with a suicide, Harry finds that his brother, a vampire of the White Court is the prime suspect.  Working along side Murphy, their relationship is growing beyond that of just friends, but can Harry get over that she and Kencaid went to Hawaii?  Once a coven is found to be Thomas's next target, an old enemy of Harry's shows her face.  And, his old childhood friend and first love, Elaine is there to protect the witches of the coven.  The weight of being a warden is bearing down on him, along with teaching his apprentice, Molly.  Once again, with the aid of Marcone and Lasciel, Harry is able to uncover a threatening plot of the White Vampires."
1394,"White Night (The Dresden Files, #9)",0451461401,Jim Butcher,Barnes and Noble,4.7,etimme on LibraryThing,"This has been my favorite of the Dresden Files books so far. Harry went to Warden boot camp to teach new recruits and in the time between books 8 and 9 he gained a lot of fighting prowess. His single silver telekinetic ring has been upgraded to four twisted bands of silver, he crafted a new charm bracelet, and he more readily uses both Lasciel and Hellfire in his magic. We saw what Wardens Morgan and Luccio were able to do at the end of Dead Beat - White Night brings us a Harry that's moving in the same direction.This book continues the thread of Harry being concerned for the isolation of the slightly-magical community, and we see a reemergence of two old villains and get a name put to the faceless threat that's been around since the first book - the Black Council.The end of the book leaves us with more questions than answers. Lasciel is presumably dead after sacrificing herself to save Harry's mind and life - can Harry still draw on Hellfire with the shadow gone from his mind? We still don't know who fixed little Chicago, and we also don't know who blew up Murphy's car. The Black Council is moving here, but there are other forces moving behind the scene to combat them. It's frustrating as a reader to see so many puzzle pieces but not being given any edge pieces.After 9 books I still don't know Butcher's mind. He doesn't readily kill off his characters, and overall the series has been moving towards Harry collecting allies - not losing them. Still, I think I'm going to call Ebenezar McCoy as being part of the Black Council. It would be fitting, I think, for the author to break Harry's progress and make him question more closely the friends he has accumulated through a more core betrayal by his master."

1395,The Miniaturist,0062306812,Jessie Burton,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Sandy-thereadingcafe,"3.75 stars:  THE MINIATURIST is an historical fiction storyline set in seventeenth century Amsterdam. Told from close third person POV, this is the story of newlywed Nella Oortman &ndash;an eighteen year old young woman whose new and much older husband &ndash;merchant trader-Johannes Brandt is emotionally distant but not unkind. As the days blend into weeks Nella learns there are secrets within the Brandt household that will change her life forever. But a gift from her husband of a miniature replica of their home will begin to foretell of a dark and dangerous future. With each new miniature piece that arrives, Nella fears that someone is watching their every move.
The storyline follows a few months in the life of Petronella Oortman Brandt whose relationship with her husband is a matter of convenience. Left alone to her own devices, Nella begins to uncover family secrets hidden behind closed doors and secret rooms. Johannes reputation as a trader has garnered him a few loyal followers but it is his dalliances on the side that will see the beginning of the end. A negotiated promise of sales fails to produce the desired results and someone will seek revenge.

THE MINIATURIST is a storyline that is set in 1686 around the time of the sugar cane plantation exploitation and slavery in the British West Indies. As the Dutch begin to import the candied sweet the business of trading and selling is one of critical survival. Here in lies a part of the storyline where Johannes Brandt&rsquo;s personal and private life become fodder for public consumption-the politics and religion of the time will show no mercy.
Johanne&rsquo;s sister Marin plays a major role throughout the storyline but like Johanne she is emotionally distant and lacks any sort of literary color. Most of the household members remain static in their development but Johanne&rsquo;s one time friends will play a role in his downfall.  It is not until the end of the story that we get a glimpse into the Brandt family dynamics and the darker secrets that they share. 

THE MINIATURIST is a well written, dark and dramatic tale about family, betrayal, love and loss. It is a tragic look at life in the 1600s-from slavery to racism; judgment and religion; health, welfare and survival in a world where people have set themselves upon a pedestal of unreachable heights. The miniaturist is always in the background but never thoroughly explored-there are so many unanswered questions as to the who and why of the miniaturist&rsquo;s involvement in the story--for all intents and purposes another storyline is required to clear up some of the mystery and to acknowledge to what purpose the miniaturist played in their lives. There is a hint of the paranormal with the miniaturist&rsquo;s prophetic gifts."

By page 200 it was straight to my top 10 list(maybe even 5). There is a little bit of love, extreme action, supense, danger, and twists and turns here and there. That silly kender Tasslehoff tips it off with humor. Slowly it builds up from some friends meeting to them fighting a Dragon Highlord! If you like swords, magic, love, humor, action, adventure, dragons and walking warrior skeletons, BUY THIS BOOK(at the very least read it)! I CAN GARANTEE YOU WILL NOT REGRET YOUR CHOICE!!!!!

1397,"The Lost Colony (Artemis Fowl, #5)",0786849568,Eoin Colfer,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"This book is but another reason why the Artemis Fowl trilogy is favored by readers of all ages in the world.  Fostered around a great plot, this novel will keep you immersed in the intense and humorous storyline for hours.  However, I feel that this book is truly great because of its precise and colorful details.  These details paint a picture in your mind to the point where you're there, standing in some of the most luxurious and complex places in the world or right in the middle of a battle, watching rubble and bodies flying all over the place.  Destinations you've never even heard of will seem crystal clear through Colfer's fluent writing. As a person who enjoys reading fantasy novels, I thought that the cooperation between what's fictional and non-fictional really took this book to another level.  Instead of having different groups split to do separate objectives, Colfer is able to make them work together, thus eliminating the confusion between parties.  However, the best part of this book is the deep plot.  It keeps you guessing as it unfolds, each new event causing more clouding of what is really happening.  When you think you have grasped the causes for these bizarre events, Colfer throws you a curveball, and then it's back to square one again.  Although I would suggest this book to all readers who love fantasy books, I think that it is best suited for the younger generations.  Not much wordage is very challenging, and the humor in the book would be more appealing towards a younger audience.  Overall, I thought that this was a very fluent and well written book.  Although the language can be simple at times, the great details and deep plot will have you burning the late-night oil.  If you are looking for a book filled with details and humor, I would suggest this book without hesitation."

1397,"The Lost Colony (Artemis Fowl, #5)",0786849568,Eoin Colfer,Barnes and Noble,4.5,TeensReadToo,"Artemis Fowl is back (finally)! I was terrified that my favorite Irish billionaire genius teenager was gone for good because author Eoin Colfer has been publishing a variety of books in the last couple of years that had nothing to do with good old Artemis. But, fortunately, the boy genius hasn't been forgotten. He's back and more brilliant than ever in this fifth installment of the high-tech fantasy series. As THE LOST COLONY opens, Artemis is fourteen years old and experiencing the uncomfortable pangs of puberty. While that alone is enough to keep most teens busy for a few years, Artemis has to contend with his surging hormones while trying to save an entire fairy race as it teeters on the brink of extinction. But it's that kind of multitasking that has made Artemis Fowl an international sensation. THE LOST COLONY has all the elements that Fowl fans have come to expect, including a dizzying array of fairy-issue gadgets, danger whizzing past our heroes from a variety of sources, ingenious plans, and a bodyguard who is as loyal as he is lethal. This book also includes a few new characters who were, for the most part, likeable and fun. The one notable exception is a twelve-year-old French girl who could give Artemis a run for his money in the genius category. She is pretty, rich, and highly annoying. I often found myself wishing that one of the other characters would ""accidentally"" dunk her in a sewer, or shave her head, or something equally unpleasant. Is it wrong for me to have feelings of aggression toward a fictional character? No, I don't think so. And you'll understand what I mean once you read the book. Fans of the ARTEMIS FOWL series will not be disappointed in this newest adventure. There were a few problems with the story, including some hard-to-follow descriptions of how Artemis and company escape their latest predicament, and an irritating French girl (see above). Overall, though, I found this an enjoyable book with an ending that knocked me for a loop. And, as always, I was left wondering what mischief Artemis will dream up next."
1398,"Extras (Uglies, #4)",1416951172,Scott Westerfeld,Barnes and Noble,4.1,smokesignls,"After reading all about Tally, Shay and David for three books, I was left longing for more.  Extras had them to some degree, but not as much as I would have liked.  It successfully answered the ""what happens next"" question left hanging at the end of Specials, but I wasn't a fan of introducing a whole new cast of characters."
1398,"Extras (Uglies, #4)",1416951172,Scott Westerfeld,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"People who like reading about adventures will without a doubt enjoy this book! The title is Extras and it is written by Scott Westerfeld.  The genre is teen adventure/science fiction. In Extras the reader is introduced to Aya Fuse, who is tired of being a nobody. After a party, she meets the Sly Girls, a group of brave girls who want nothing to do with fame, which is all Aya wants. Aya gets her chance when they discover something that could bring her fame but could put the rest of the world in danger. My opinion on Extras is that it's a very attention-grabbing book. From page one to the end, it had my complete interest. It is full of excitement and many people can relate to some things that happen in this book. So, if anyone is in for an adventure, read Extras!"
1398,"Extras (Uglies, #4)",1416951172,Scott Westerfeld,Barnes and Noble,4.1,WordCandie,"I couldn't stop at Specials when I discovered there was a 4th installment in the series, but I was disappointed by most of this story. At first I was mostly just confused by the jump in time and the abandonment of Tally's story. I was really happy that she was reintroduced later in the story but this one fell flat for me overall. I would never have skipped it though, due to my dedication to the series as a whole. Don't expect the same excitement of Specials to be repeated in this story."

It was exciting, thrilling, and interesting from page one to the ending.  My favorite character is Halt although I adore Will and Horace.  Halt is a caring and good teacher.  He is patient with Will and supports his growth as an individual.  Will goes on simple mission with Gilan, who is Halt's former apprentice.  Only the simple mission turns out to be anything but complicated!!  There is a part in the story where Halt, who is in a bad mood, misses Will.  So he is assigned to escort Alyss on a diplomatic mission.  The interaction between these two characters is a delight to read.  The ending with the bridge is awesome and well worth reading the book.  I really enjoyed all the excitment.  Well done, Mr. Flanagan!!!!"

1400,"The Book of Life (All Souls Trilogy, #3)",0670025593,Deborah Harkness,Barnes and Noble,4.4,crystalmmccabe,"*This review was a collaborative effort on behalf of Orchard Book Club* - Crystal McCabe

Orchard Book Club was lucky enough to receive an advanced copy of The Book of Life.  Both of us devoured it in about a day.  Fellow member Rachel will be adding her review after she reads it too so stay tuned for that.  Before we start, we think it&rsquo;s important that you know something about us (Tina &amp; Crystal).  

See, we met because of this series.  We were both on Twitter anxiously sending tweets to Deb Harkness over the release of Shadow of Night around two years ago and found each other.  It was an All Souls Trilogy match made in heaven.  Two super fans of the series who became instant online friends.  That being said, you must understand that we are both utterly devoted to this book and the entire series.  We seriously love it.  Everything about it.  The characters, Matthew, the writing, the plot, Matthew, the entire experience, and, most importantly, Matthew.  (Matthew is Crystal&rsquo;s absolute top book boyfriend ever.  And she reads &ndash; a lot!)  

Now, onto the review.  We pick up right where we left off with Matthew and Diana having arrived back from the past to Sept-Tours to see their combined family.  It&rsquo;s amazing how both families are so different but come together for the sake of Matthew and Diana and the greater overall picture of sacrifice and love.  And there is a much greater picture being painted that will reveal itself at the end.  There is great strength and solidarity shown by both families to be able to put aside their vast differences and beliefs in order to support Matthew and Diana and what they represent against not only the Congregation but also against all other enemies.  There are very noticeable differences at Sept-Tours since they arrived back, but everyone must strive to move forward and continue on the journey at hand.  There is not one soul, living or dead, that wants Matthew and Diana to give up on the journey that consumes them.  

Enemies and foes seem to be flying at the de Clermonts/Bishops at every turn in The Book of Life.  This brings to the forefront the quest to find the missing page of Ashmole 782 in order to attempt to unlock its secrets.  Everyone believes that if the book can be repaired by returning the three missing pages that it can explain, among other things like creature origins and blood rage in vampires, how Diana is able to carry Matthew&rsquo;s children.  After all, there is a paranormal romance going on in this series.  And we love the moments Matthew and Diana are able to steal away with each other.  Matthew&rsquo;s pet names for Diana of mon coeur and ma lionne are particularly heartwarming to us.  We just melt when he calls her mon coeur and fall a little more in love with him.  The struggles Matthew faces with being mated to Diana and his intense need to protect her and be near her are a challenge for them both in this book.  There even comes a time when they have to fight their battle separately on two different fronts in order to be able to meet in the middle in the end.  This is particularly difficult for both of them.  Matthew realizes what he must do in order to move forward and he struggles greatly with having to be apart from Diana.  However, there is also much understanding to be had about the great strength that Diana possesses as well during this time.  

Without giving anything away, a lot of past characters are more prevalent in this book.  Everyone has a purpose.  Some you love, some you hate, some you come to finally understand, and some you just want to strangle.  But we assure you that everyone has their purpose.  Deb writes each character so well and so deeply that you have no choice but love them all in the end because each one plays an integral part in the overall story.  We even get a better look into all things endearing and heart-rendering about Gallowglass (who was the favorite addition in Shadow of Night for both of us).  Some characters we thought we left back in Shadow of Night resurface as well.  Like we said, rest assured that EVERYONE has their purpose in this series.  

While the battle continues to rage, something beautiful happens.  Babies.  The scenes surrounding the twins were a particular favorite for us.  The dialogue makes you feel like you are in the room.  It&rsquo;s that strong.  With the addition of the two newest members of the Bishop-Clairmont clan we really feel how important it is to fight the Congregation and put the issues of the Covenant to rest once and for all.  That is the most pressing issue.  Finding out about Matthew&rsquo;s blood rage and the possibilities of it being passed on are a pressing second but with the team they have working on the genetics of it, rest assured that the matter is in good hands.  

We feel confident that everyone will agree in the end that no one saw what was coming.  We were both completely blind-sighted by some of the events that occur towards the end of the book.  We finally get to see Diana come into her own and become stronger than anyone thought she ever could.  We get to see Matthew take a few steps back and let her lead once in a while.  When this happens you really get a sense of how strong the power of love truly is.  It&rsquo;s not just about a witch and a vampire anymore.  It&rsquo;s not just about the difference in worlds.  It&rsquo;s about love and family and the importance of doing whatever you must to protect it.  

Deb just has a way of sending you into this magical world full of so much love, heartbreak, happiness, suspense, hatred, heartbreak, and utter and complete wonderfulness that you will forever be changed by her story.  We were!  The Book of Life ties the All Souls Trilogy up neatly into one of Diana&rsquo;s weaving knots.  Everything has its place and we don&rsquo;t think we could&rsquo;ve imagined a better ending to the story.   We are equal parts sad that it&rsquo;s over and extremely happy about the journey.  We became friends because of Deborah Harkness and her books so it seemed only fitting that we worked together on this review.  We very anxiously awaiting this book knowing it would be the conclusion of our favorite characters.  We will continue to reread the All Souls Trilogy whenever we are in need of a great book.  Matthew will remain Crystal&rsquo;s favorite book boyfriend (probably ever).  

In closing, we say &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; to Deborah Harkness for inviting us into her world of witches, vampires, and daemons.  We are forever changed by your words and we sincerely hope that you will continue to write more books.  To the readers, please trust us - you won&rsquo;t be sorry!"

1401,The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,1585421464,Julia Cameron,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"Dreams: Our fond hopes and aspirations.  Dreams are born of crisis. Dreams are born of chance. Dreams are born of choice. The early to mid 1990's was an awful time for me an my family. Picture one bad thing crashing in on top of the other. 'Why God'?, I cried, more in despair,then anger. I was heartbroken.      THE ARTIST'S WAY is a guide on the journey to recapture and nourish the things of our youth; spontaneity, joy, adventurousness, and creativity. 'In a sense,' writes author Julia Cameron, ' our lives become our work of art.' If Cameron is correct,then I had allowed my work to reflect a life filled with 'crazymakers,' 'dream killers,' and codependece. I had lost sight of precious priorities. The atrophy of success had dulled my sense of possibility.    Using her own life illustrations, Julia Cameron presents a progression of exercises for a twelve week program to reclaim 'the creative self.' I recommend 'reading deprivation.' ('For most blocked creatives reading is an addiction.  We gobble the words of others rather than digest our own thoughts and feelings, rather than cook up something of our own.') I also recommend affirmations.(Put them in writing.)    Cameron calls THE ARTIST'S WAY her spiritual journey,'a pilgrimage home to the self.' It is for me."
1401,The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,1585421464,Julia Cameron,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"On Christmas of 1994 my husband gave me this book by my request.  I began The Artist's Way the next day and threw myself into the program lock, stock and barrel.  Now, all these years later, I can honestly say that this book was among one of my major influences in life. I not only became more aware of my creativity, I learned to be aware of times when I let it go lax, so that I can reclaim it.  There is never anything like the first time you go through the 12 weeks.  I tried to recreate the experience, but it is never as powerful.  I advise anyone doing this to do ALL the steps. Do not skip things like reading deprivation and the money issues because otherwise you will miss something you need to understand the larger process.  TAW has brought many wonderful things to my life, not the least gave me the courage to begin college at the age of 43. Now I am an English teacher and I love my career. One of the things colleagues always say is that I am creative.  It is a direct result of living the principles of this book.  It is never too late to find the creative life.  Don't just BUY this book -- take it for all its worth!"
1401,The Artist's Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity,1585421464,Julia Cameron,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"This book is awesome! I re-connected with thoughts and dreams I'd either   forgotten or never knew I had.  The 'as a kid' exercise ( pg. 125) helps dredge up  some of those thoughts and dreams.  In the exercise, you complete several sentences.  For example, 'As a kid, I missed the chance to . . .' or 'As a kid, I lacked . . .' or 'As a kid, I dreamed of being . . . .' I discovered that I thought extreme snowboarding, jai alai, and poker are fun things I'd never do (page 87).  One of my favorite exercises was to list 20 things for 'If I didn't have to do it perfectly, I would   try. . .'  Tango lessons.  Surfing.  Flower arranging.  Wearing a kimono.  Writing a verse play.  This book asks you to make lots of lists--which I liked. From the 'five people you admire' to 'five favorite childhood foods' (pages 76-77).  Ovaltine rocks!!!  And so does this book."

1403,Horns,0061147958,Joe Hill,Barnes and Noble,4,TDotts,"The title of Joe Hill's second novel encapsulates the problem facing its main character - Horns. Ignatius ""Ig"" Perrish wakes up after a hard night of drinking brought on by the one-year anniversary of his girlfriend's murder. He may not have his memories, but he does have horns. Actual, bony protuberances. A trip to the hospital finds the horns aren't the only unusual thing about Ig.

He has the ability to make people around him disclose their innermost thoughts, sinful fantasies and confessions of past and planned crimes. If he touches someone, he sees their sinful pasts. If he thinks about it, he can make them act on their worst desires.

The first people Ig listens in on confirm one of his worst fears. Everyone believes he's guilty of murdering and raping his girlfriend, Merrin. Even his parents who just wish Ig would go away. His brother, who hosts a late-night talk show, falls under the horns' spell and tells Ig who really murdered Merrin. And all of this happens in the first fifth of the book.

In a typical horror novel, Ig would embark on a quest to rid himself of the horns and seek justice. But Hill isn't a typical horror writer. Instead of rejecting the evil of the horns, Ig embraces it, finding it second nature to encourage people to act out their desires. Ig isn't a hero in the conventional sense of the word.

It could be hard to root for him to succeed - usually a reader cheers for the characters fighting the devil - but traditional good and evil don't apply here. Hill doesn't take a black-and-white view of the world in Horns; it's grey streaked with darks and lights. Perhaps the question underlying the novel's events is whether evil is necessary.

Where Hill hits his stride is in the extended flashbacks to younger versions of the main characters. The novel becomes a coming-of-age story where teenagers do stupid teenage things that create bonds between them lasting well into adulthood. The allure of cherry bombs sets off a chain of events that introduces Ig to Lee, who becomes his best friend and the third player in the Ig-Merrin relationship.

Lee has his own issues to deal with as an adult, and the clich&#233;s a lesser author might trot out never come to pass. The characters are complicated and fully realized. Even minor characters enter with a full history. The reader has the impression Hill knows all of his characters down to what brand of toothpaste they use. Hill's talented so he doesn't feel the need to put everything he knows down on the page. It's enough he knows and uses that knowledge to inform the choices the characters make.

The flashbacks can hold more attraction than the present-day pieces, but that may be because they tell the story of before Ig's life fell apart. As the horns become more important to who Ig is, the reader starts to look for signs Ig will find a way out, that good will prevail and innocence will take the day. These things happen . and they don't. Not all questions are answered by the last page. And the ones that are don't come with a nicely tied ribbon.

It's inevitable Horns will be compared with Hill's first novel, Heart-shaped Box. Whether one is better than the other is a matter of personal taste. The two novels are different, with Horns coming off as a little more fantastical and requiring a little more fantastical and requiring a little more suspension of disbelief. Regardless, Horns is an enjoyable read that leaves you anxious for another Joe Hill book."
1403,Horns,0061147958,Joe Hill,Barnes and Noble,4,LadyHester,"At first I wasn't sure I like this book or the cast of characters. However, the more I read the more intrigued I became. This story is simply so original and unique that it stands alone in the horror genre. Joe Hill is a powerful writer and close to becoming one of my favorites. This book examines the evil in everyone, especially in those we love the most and we who think love us back."
1403,Horns,0061147958,Joe Hill,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"First of all, I'd like to address those people who feel the need to tell the entire story line, paragragh after paragragh. STOP IT! It's annoying, boring, and ruins it for the rest of us. A review is supposed to be a paragraph or two describing WHY you did or did not like the book. With that being said, HORNS is one of the best books I've read in a while. Great characters, intetesting plot, and some surprising twists. Kept me interested the whole way through.  I will definitely be reading more from this author!"
1404,Catherine the Great: Portrait of a Woman,0679456724,Robert K. Massie,Barnes and Noble,4,FeatheredQuillBookReviews,"Catherine II, Empress of all the Russians, is known as one of the most powerful and hard working people in history. Many writers and historians have not always been sympathetic to her regarding her private life and have overlooked her achievements when ruling Russia. In contrast, Mr. Massie has written a stellar biography of Catherine that tells the reader what an accomplished and remarkable woman she became. Catherine was born in Stettin, in 1729. Stettin was then Germany and is now Poland. Her father was Prince Christian Augustus of Anhalt-Zerbst, a prince of a lesser-known family among the many principalities in Germany. Her mother, Princess Johanna of Holstein-Gottorp, was much younger than the Prince but was from a much higher-ranked family. She was given the name: Sophia Augusta Frederika of Anhalt-Zerbst. After Sophia was born, her mother became bored with the provincial life of Stettin, where her husband was a high ranking officer in the Prussian Army. As Johanna was related to many noble families in Germany, she took every opportunity to travel to the courts of Zerbst, Hamburg, Brunswick, Kiel and even Berlin. Many years before this, Johanna's brother Prince Karl August of Holstein-Gottorp had gone to Russia to marry the Princess Elizabeth Petrovna, daughter of Peter the Great. Before the wedding took place, the Prince died of small pox, leaving Elizabeth heart-broken. Elizabeth's nephew, son of her sister Anna, came to St. Petersburg when his parents died at Elizabeth's behest and was named as the heir to the throne of Russia as his mother and Aunt were daughters of Peter the Great of Russia. In November of the year 1741, Princess Elizabeth seized the throne with the help of the Imperial Guards, formally declaring her nephew Peter Ulrich of Holstein-Gottorp the heir to the throne. When she brought him to St. Petersburg she changed his name to Grand Duke Peter Fedorovich, the future Tzar Peter III. Peter was now 14 years old and it was time to look for a bride for him. Elizabeth remembered fondly the family of Karl August, whom she had been engaged to marry and invited the Princess Johanna, sister of her deceased fiance and the Princess Sophia to come to St. Petersberg to meet the heir to the throne and plan a wedding between the two young people. Sophia's name was changed to Catherine II and she went on to marry the future Peter III. She was treated badly by Peter and looked for companionship elsewhere with young men of the court. Her favorite companion was Gregory Potempkin by whom, it was said, she had her child Paul, who became heir to the throne. While she was Empress, she dealt with the many trials and tribulations of her country and looked after the welfare of the Russian people. She was praised by many and, as usual, condemned by some - and the author has remarked on all of her triumphs and failures. Her family, friends, enemies, lovers, etc. are all told about in abundance, including her mother, forever making plans that made her look good, and her husband who had nothing to do with her, ignoring her most of the time. This story is grand and glorious as are Robert Massie's previous works: (Nicholas and Alexandra and Peter the Great: His Life and World). The story is accurate, the characters very true to life, with much style and detail. Quill Says: For readers of history, this is a gem. A life story of an extraordinary woman which is very rich in color and drama."
1404,Catherine the Great: Portrait of a Woman,0679456724,Robert K. Massie,Barnes and Noble,4,The_Paperback_Pursuer,"Description:
          Catherine the Great: Portrait of a Woman by Robert K. Massie is the biography of Sophia Augusta, later known as Russian Empress Catherine the Great. It details Sophia's childhood, marriage, children, affairs, rise to power, famed coup, and eventual death. It is based on recorded historical documents and on Catherine's memoirs.

Review:
     I have never read any other books by Robert K. Massie, but now I'm hooked. Catherine the Great: Portrait of a Woman is one of the most well-researched and compelling biographies that I have read to-date. The history contained in its 600+ pages is phenomenal, and once I started reading I didn't want to stop. Not only was Catherine the Great a strong-willed, clever, and courageous leader, but an amazing woman who was years ahead of her time. The book was laid out in typical biographical format, birth to death, but Massie's mastery of description and detail put the book in another class entirely. I felt like I was reading a gripping fictional account of the empress as she ruled and fought for equality and preservation of the Russian state, instead of a dry biography filled with dates and facts. I was very impressed with the book's pace as well as the depiction of many famous figures, particularly Diderot, Gregory Potemkin, and d'Alembert. I wish I would have had this book handy for my European history class because I truly feel like I have a better understanding of Russia as a country as well as the politics of the time period. I recommend this to history-lovers, history / literature students, and anyone who wants to experience the awe and majesty of Catherine the Great!

Rating: On the Run (4.5/5)

1405,"The Year of the Flood  (MaddAddam, #2)",0385528779,Margaret Atwood,Barnes and Noble,3.9,kren250,"Margaret Atwood's latest book The Year of the Flood is another of her dystopian offerings. It's many years in the future (Atwood never gives an exact date), and humans have finally managed to destroy much in the natural world. Many animal species are extinct, pollution is rampant, weather is out of control, and society is buckling down to live out the days the best they can. Into all this comes the ""waterless flood"", a disaster that has wiped out nearly all the humans in the world. At least two have survived: Toby, the manager of a high-end spa who has barricaded herself inside; and Ren, a dancer/prostitute who was in the ""sticky zone"" (a type of sick bay) when the disaster hit. Now, separately, the two have to try to survive in this strange new unpeopled world. Will they ever find each other? And, the bigger question: did anyone else survive? 

I really liked this book; it's not only a great read but very thought-provoking as well. The story is told with flashbacks to Ren and Toby's former lives, which added a lot to the book; it made an interesting contrast to see what things were like before the waterless flood. Toby is tough, smart, and resourceful; and it's always wonderful to see a strong female protaganist (one reason I love Atwood's books). I also thought Atwood did an excellent job of showing how bad things could possibly get on earth in the years to come, without being preachy about it. 

I did have two minor quibbles about the book, which is why I gave it four stars instead of five. The first was the annoyingly cute futuristic names many of the things are given: ""Anooyoo"", ""violet biolet"", ""SekSmart"", ""Mo'hairs"", ""Sea/H/Ear candy"", ""liobams"" (if names will really be this cheesy in the future than the world is indeed in trouble;-)!. Yes, it's a very minor thing, but for some reason it grated on my nerves a bit. The other quibble I can't say without giving away spoilers, but it has to do with some coincidences that happen towards the end of the book. I didn't find these coincidences to be very plausible. 

Minor quibbles non-withstanding, I could barely tear myself away from the pages of this book. I highly recommend it, especially if you like your sci-fi with a mix of great literature."
1405,"The Year of the Flood  (MaddAddam, #2)",0385528779,Margaret Atwood,Barnes and Noble,3.9,book-a-holick,"I read Oryx and Crake and Year of the Flood back to back. I had really enjoyed Oryx and Crake, and expected Year of the Flood to be a smooth continuation of the first book, but it is not. I was about a fourth of the way through the second book before I realized and accepted, yea, embraced, the fact that Year of the Flood has a style and focus and engaging characters all its own. The two books should be read in order, but the reader must be open-minded when starting the second book, as it approaches the causes and aftermath of the pandemic (waterless flood) in a totally different but equally entertaining way. 
P.S. About half way through, I was thrilled to see a few of our 'friends' from Oryx and Crake cropping up!"

1406,Winter Garden,0312364121,Kristin Hannah,Barnes and Noble,4.3,GrannnyJude,This was my first time reading Kristen Hannah and I was absolutely mesmerized by this story and the way she portrayed the characters. It was a heartwrenching story of a time in history that changed so many lives and gave us a picture of how it changed a family forever. I was not able to put the book down once I started it and was drawn into the intrigue of what the secret of Anya's life was and what had turned her so cold.  Kristen Hannah's storytelling in this novel give us a close decription of the connection between families and how love can prevail.

After reading this book, I am truly grateful for men such as Marcus who are willing to put their lives on the line in order to protect mine. The courage these men have cannot be denied. This book should be read by all. I read some of the recent reviews and took great offense on comments regarding the political slant. This book is not about that. Regardless of how you feel about war and the US involvment, one cannot be less than thankful for the protection we have by our military. This book is so very highly recommended.

It does an unbelievable job of weaving in lessons about hard work and determination, friendship, family, and the unwavering spirit of america. 

If it were up to me, this would be assigned reading for every high school senior- my generation could really take away so much from the experiences shared in this book.

Oh-- and to the person who claimed this book was written by an author who just continuously 'patted himself on the back', you become a navy seal and do multiple tours in iraq and afghanistan and tell me he doesn't deserve the credit he gives himself. He truly is an American hero. Five stars does not give this book nearly enough justice."

I had assumed it would be a real chore to read but I loved it. The beginning was really boring but after awhile I got really into it. When the ending came I had no idea, no idea. I had assumed the killer would be fairly obvious and I had my theory but the conclusion really caught me by surprise. The ending really made the story.

Howsoever, I tried I could not come up with one clear suspect. Agatha Christie expertly shifts her focus of suspicions from one character to another leaving the reader with no clue as to the real murderer. I tried all my &quot;little grey cells&quot; but could not pin point the murderer and when the killer was finally introduced I felt as if I had been punched so hard that no air was left in my lungs!

1411,Native Son,006083756X,Richard Wright,Barnes and Noble,4.3,DeDeFlowers,"I am one to shy away from books about race. A lot of times I find it hard to relate or I find them to be boring or too graphic. I read this book because it was on a list of the 100 best books ever written and it is my goal to read them all to check out the hype. I really did not want to read Native Son.
From the first sentence of the first page I knew this was going to be something special. Wright's writing is captivating and the characters he builds are so real. Even if you cannot relate to this book personally, you will be able to relate to the emotions the main character Bigger Thomas is feeling. It is an amazing thing to be engrossed so deeply into a book as I was with this one. The plot is unique, especially as far as books about race go. Surprisingly this is also a very fast read. For a couple reasons: you cannot put it down and it is written very matter-of-fact. 
I can see why kids in high school might not want to read this. It's long and seems out of date. To be honest it might even go over a lot of the heads in a regular English class. I feel like this novel is for anyone though. It's important. This book is on my list of best books ever...which only had 11 books prior. That is a big deal! Read it :)"
1411,Native Son,006083756X,Richard Wright,Barnes and Noble,4.3,bluetulip18,"Along with Invisible Man, Native Son is another powerful story that has schooled me on what W.E.B. Du Bois might have meant by ""double consciouness"": African Americans' tendency to see themselves through the eyes of others. Bigger, the main character, judges himself by society's stereotypes, and a profound fear of whites drives his every action (including a heinous crime so vividly described I had to put the book down for awhile). It's mind-boggling and tragic to think how much a person can truly become what society expects and assumes he'll be. Difficult story to swallow; an emotional, memorable read."
1411,Native Son,006083756X,Richard Wright,Barnes and Noble,4.3,ECooper-Columbus,"Richard Wright¿s depiction on race relations in the 1940's was parallel to the thinking of most Black and White Americans today. We saw that with the newly elected president. I found this book a much needed read, not to conjure up racial tension but as a reminder of how we, Black and White Americans need to continue to strive for racial equality. He talked about how the price of food is higher in one section than another, how redlining occured than, which is another parallel of today¿s housing market. I, as a teacher, will use this book as a teaching tool to inspire my children to release pinned up anger by talking to an adult or someone they trust; use Bigger's lack of education to inspire them to stay in school. There are so many teaching tools that you can be pulled from this book and used as inspiration. The relevance of this book is still very useful today. It is a great read, I couldn't put it down."

It  excellently follows the first book in the trilogy (way of shadows). The book also sets you up for the last book. For an excellent read that has great magic and superb martial arts and tremendous plot you can not go wrong with Brent Weeks.
1412,"Shadow's Edge (Night Angel, #2)",0316033650,Brent Weeks,Barnes and Noble,4.6,readafew on LibraryThing,"This book was a wild ride.  A lot happens.  Our 'hero' has a lot of growing up to do and he isn't given a choice in the matter.  He tries hard to live the quite life but trouble seems to seek him out. It doesn't hurt that he doesn't try hiding very hard either.  Logan is put through an incredible crucible of his own and he came out much stronger for it.  Several of the other characters had plenty of their own trials, none of them easy.Weeks is brutal to his characters to say the least.  I have to admit that in the middle of the book things were almost getting to be too much and I was having a hard time reading.  Then things seemed to break loose and all the bad things were at least more balanced with some good things moving everyone forward.  While it wasn't a happily ever after (and I don't think anyone expected that at any time) it at least leaves you feeling some hope for the future and that there is still a chance that things will turn out better than they started.In many books, especially fantasy,  you have a pretty good idea that many of the 'good guys' will make it the end and have a happily ever after.  Not with The Night Angel, you suspect at least one or two will make it to the end and have a satisfactory ending.  I am eagerly awaiting my chance to finish the trilogy to see what happens."

Eline bugged me with her holier than thou attitude and her ""love"" that was so powerful, but only - of course - as long as Kylar changed his behavior to match what she thought he should be. There were a lot more ""character development"" scenes in this book than in the first - i.e there was a chapter dedicated to Eline's moralizing, Vi's life, and Dorion's insanity. Oh, and Kylar's moping about how he has to choose between ""love"" and everything else he knows and wants. Once I skimmed through these long passages, however, the story kept me reading. So many things that I wanted resolved: the GodKing, the Night Angel, the witches, Vi, Logan... actually, I liked every plot thread except the very long segment where Kylar passed time trying to be a house-husband to a woman who only loves him if he acts how she wants him to. Once this section ended, however, the story carried on without further delays... which makes me wonder if the author had this section here in order to show how Kylar spent the 3 months between the coup and the commencement of this story's plot and it wasn't really intended as part of this story's plotting? that makes more sense.Overall, it's a satisfying story - full of angst, judgement, retribution and justice..."
1413,"Under the Never Sky (Under the Never Sky, #1)",1907411054,Veronica Rossi,Barnes and Noble,4.5,AcesMommy,"Under The Never Sky is the BEST opener to the coming New Year!! It renders you speechless in how great it is! I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!
Right from the very first pages you will know that you would have to cancel your daily chores and activities and cuddle up to this book. Because it will grab your attention from start to finish! Expect sleepless nights!
Aria is a character that you can easily find yourself wanting to be friends with. At first you'd think she's nothing more than a sheltered brat wanting her mother, but as she goes through her journey to seek the truth and in finding her mom she tremendously matures right before your eyes. 
I enjoyed that in the beginning Perry was repulsed by Aria; not only in her actions but by her smell. That was hilarious when I first read it. It's great when the leading male doesn't fall for the leading gal right away. I also loved how blunt Perry was with his words even though he doesn't say much. He never held back in fear of hurting her feelings, and Aria would just take it without sulking.
The story is told in the point of views of Aria and Perry. They go hand in hand in telling their part in their journey. Never missing a step from each other and not having you skip a beat on what's going on. Veronica Rossi has done a fine job in getting you in the mindset of 'Under The Never Sky'. I cried when it came to it, and I screamed at characters I wanted beaten. The descriptions of the 'PODS', Aether, surroundings, and just everything wasn't lacking or overly done. There was balance, and I guess that's what made me enjoy the story a lot. 
The ending is such a TEASE!! When I got to the last page my heart sunk. I can't believe it is just coming into release! I don't know how I can hold over till Book #2 =)
Under The Never Sky by Veronica Rossi is a MUST READ DEBUT!! A definite 2012 favorite!!"
1413,"Under the Never Sky (Under the Never Sky, #1)",1907411054,Veronica Rossi,Barnes and Noble,4.5,erinleighh,"After reading The Hunger Games trilogy I was looking for something just as gritty with the underlying romantic element that I crave. Amazon recommended this book to me to fill the Hunger Games void...but now I'm finding that I need something to fill the chasm that Under the Never Sky left! The characters were likable and had real flaws that they had to work out. The relationships were heartfelt and believable, and I could not get enough of the love game between the leads. As for the writing, it was beautifully crafted between the two perspectives and it was cleverly handled so there was minimal overlap and absolutely zero gaps. All in all, this was an exciting adventure and I cannot wait for the second book!!"
1413,"Under the Never Sky (Under the Never Sky, #1)",1907411054,Veronica Rossi,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Buried-in-Books,"Characters- I like Aria from the start. She was determined to get answers from people who might have them so she used her singing abilities to her advantage. When things went awry, she took charge and tried to find a way out. When she has to tell her story, she does, even though it may condemn her. And when she finds herself alone outside of the safety of Reverie, she doesn't sit down and have a pity fest. I would have the biggest sob fest ever and wait to die. But she gets up and looks for a way back to where she thinks she can find her mother. I like this character very much! I like Perry as much as I like Aria. He's not nice to her, but that's not really his way. Being nice is not a survival skill and that's what it takes to live outside. He takes Aria's insults really well when I'm sure he'd like to backhand her. And he has a slow growing admiration for her which is well deserved. He makes no allowances for her, makes her keep up, but he also feeds her and clothes her. It's more than I would do for the enemy. The Writing and Storyline- The story is told with one chapter narrated in Aria's point of view and the other Perry's. I loved it being written this way. I love knowing what's going on in both characters minds instead of having to guess what the other character is thinking and feeling. It makes me feel more a part of the story. I got so involved with this one I had to read it straight through. The writing is neither spare nor overly descriptive but perfect for each scene or character. Each word was chosen carefully, even the names Aria, who has a singing voice like an opera diva and Perry or Peregrine who has the sight and smell of a master hunter, the falcon. Reverie was like a dream land, unrealistic in that you couldn't feel, didn't even touch. Touch was so foreign to Aria that she was repulsed by it, even from her mother. I loved this story, this coming from a reader that says she doesn't like dystopians. I'll have to change my opinion as this and other stories have proven me wrong. Under the Never Sky was like nothing I've read before. The world was brutal, yet softened by the love between Aria and Perry, which only happened maybe in the last third of the book. But they took care of each other, helped each other and their feelings grew slowly over time. I guess I fell in love with the characters, individually and as a couple. Aria is strong, never helpless, yet doesn't refuse help when offered. Perry is confused by his feelings, but follows through on them, he doesn't deny them, he even cries and is thought none the less for it by Aria."

'true believer' has many turns and twists - and although some of sparks' books can be somewhat predictable- this one was different.  i was extremely pleased."
1414,"True Believer (Jeremy Marsh & Lexie Darnell, #1)",044669651X,Nicholas Sparks,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"The PW description seduced me into thinking it was a story about journalist investigating mysterious lights. It isn't. The lights serve only to get Our Hero to the place where he meets cliched smart beautiful librarian, so that he can ultimately embrace the charms of rural life.




Now, just about every romance formula is done over and over, and if it is done well, I enjoy it over and over. I did not think this was done well. The characters were all surface; there was no apparent reason for Hero to fall for this particular woman or she for him (except that pickings are slim in a very small town). And it struck me as being purely anti-modernist/technological -- a tiny backwater town equated with all that is good.This is a delightful novel. I liked the setting, because it is an area of NC I know quite well. As with many of Sparks' novels, any twists or turns in the plot are resolved, usually positively. Reading about good things vs action and killing is refreshing.It seems every book I read gets better and better. I love anything and everything that Nicholas Sparks comes out with. I love the fact that he takes me inside the books and I can't help but to read on."

1415,The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses,0307887898,Eric Ries,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Idesign4stars,"I Love this book! Being a designer and business owner, I am often given quite a few entrepreneurial titles as gifts. And sadly, most of them don't do much for me, in terms of advice and information I can put to use in my fashion design business. Eric Ries', The Lean Startup is a major exception to this however! 

I found so much useful info in this book that it made me feel like Ries may be one of the few business writers who actually ""gets it"" when it comes to being an entrepreneur. I've read probably eight books this year, and only The Lean Startup and Wisdom & Wisecracks For The Aspiring Business Owner (also available on Barnes & Noble now) by Will Estell have made me feel like authors of these type books could have been  business owners themselves and get the issues that the rest of us face daily. Thanks for being ""real""!  I highly suggest this book."
1415,The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses,0307887898,Eric Ries,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"Drawing on lean manufacturing and the foundational work of people like Steve Blank, Ries has created a methodology that enables you to learn from your customers, even when you have very few, so that you can quickly identify what they want and how to give it to them. this means you operate in lean fashion- with efficiency and with agility- to make the necessary changes before you've thrown the baby out with the bathwater. Good stories, strong lucid writing. It's a great book that will be resource for innovator and business development groups for decades."

1416,"The Golden Lily (Bloodlines, #2)",1595143181,Richelle Mead,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,I read the first book and just fell in love with it. It left me wanting more. Richelle Mead just writes in a way that will keep you wanting more. I read the Vampire Academy series and fell in love with it. And now this series is another one if hers that keeps me wantin more.
1416,"The Golden Lily (Bloodlines, #2)",1595143181,Richelle Mead,Barnes and Noble,4.6,kirstin913,"This is &ndash; hands down &ndash; my new favorite book of 2012! My only complaint about Golden Lily is that it caused me to lose sleep. I finished this book in one day&hellip;and what an emotional day that was!

Normally I would write a little synopsis of the book, but not this time. Richelle Mead&rsquo;s work speaks for itself. If you&rsquo;re considering this book, chances are you&rsquo;ve probably not only read Bloodlines, but also the entire Vampire Academy series; if you haven&rsquo;t&hellip;then welcome to the Richelle fan club. With that said I&rsquo;m just going to write a few little tidbits about some of the character development within this second installment of the Bloodlines series.

Richelle Mead leads us back to Palm Springs and back into the lives of Jill, Eddie, Sydney, Adrian, and Angeline. We also see more appearances from Dmitri and Sonya Karp than we did in Bloodlines. 

Sydney goes through a lot of personal and emotional growth in this sequel. She not only learns more about the real history of Alchemists, but she also starts to realize that she has more loyalty and tolerance for the Moroi and Dhampir races&hellip;and that scares her because she doesn&rsquo;t want that info to get back to the Alchemists because they would send her to the re-education center (which she is terrified of). The prejudice that her upbringing taught her (both from her father and the Alchemists) is very hard for her to overcome and she battles with it every day. The decisions that she makes along her journey in this book will make you&hellip;. (Nope, not going to give spoilers, it&rsquo;s MUCH better to not know what&rsquo;s going to happen &ndash; trust me, it will be worth the wait.)

And let us not forget about the sexy, and ever-inebriated, Adrian. For anyone who fell in love with Adrian during the Vampire Academy series (or even if you just discovered him in Bloodlines), be prepared to completely swoon over him yet again. We&rsquo;ve all adored this sexy man who seems like he&rsquo;s in a constant battle with his mental health (thanks to his spirit magic), but in this book Adrian takes it to an all new level. I won&rsquo;t give more details and spoil the plots twists &amp; turns, but just know that hiding his feelings behind his sardonic quips and his constant smoking and drinking just isn&rsquo;t going to cut it this time.

Buy Golden Lily and get lost in between the pages. I will definitely be reading this book a couple more times before Bloodlines #3: The Indigo Spell comes out on February 12, 2013!!!"

1417,Chasing Harry Winston,0743290119,Lauren Weisberger,Barnes and Noble,3.4,Anonymous,I would give this book a 0.5. I hated it and could barely get past the first 25 pages. If you want an insanely good book read the smart one and the pretty one. This one just sucks.
1417,Chasing Harry Winston,0743290119,Lauren Weisberger,Barnes and Noble,3.4,Anonymous,"I have read other Lauren Weisberger books and have often found them somewhat contrived, but this was just a dull read. Even if you are searching simply for a quick plane read (as I was), there has to be something better out there. Perhaps re-read one of her earlier works, or a book by another author that she plugs early in the book. The characters are unoriginal, the plot is the same rehashed ""sex in the city"" like story except these three ladies lack the charm that made SITC a great series. I do not recommend this book."

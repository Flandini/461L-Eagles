It's heart racing, strong filled with emotions and you feel like your the parents! It really puts you in perspective of what it would be like if this was your child. I couldn't put the book down! It takes you right into the story and you can feel every turn, every emotion, everything that the author is writing!!"
404,Defending Jacob,0385344228,William Landay,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Kataman1,"William Landay knocked my socks off with this thriller that grabbed me from the first page and didn't let go until the last sentence. The book shows how the judgment of the most professional people can be skewed when they get emotionally involved in their work with a relative. Andrew Barber is an Assistant District Attorney called upon to open an investigation into the murder of a teen. Andrew decides to take it on himself and doesn't get swayed by the fact that the victim was a student in the same school as Andrew's teen son.

When some troubling things seem to give clues pointing to his son (Jacob), Andrew brushes them away. Even when his son becomes the prime suspect, Andrew chooses to look towards another suspect. Andrew's actions will later come into question and he will have to defend what he did to the man who was eager to take his job.

Andrew must also confront his ""hidden"" past and the author brings into play the theory of a ""murder gene"" where the tendency to be violent is passed down from father to son through the genes. A pure ""tour de force."" Should not be missed!"
404,Defending Jacob,0385344228,William Landay,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Anonymous,"One of the best books I have read in years. 
I found myself bouncing back and forth with, ""he did it!  No he couldn't have done it! Oh my God, maybe he did do it!"" Even with all the evidence piling up, and the psychological profile against his son, Andy had me seeing through his blind eyes right up until the very end. And then I STILL found myself wanting to give his son the benefit of doubt! 
After I finished the book, I was still so engrossed in the story that I felt compelled to explain the whole darn thing to my husband! I read alot and have NEVER described in detail any book to my husband. I couldn't seem to get the story out of my head.
That's how good this book is. It will draw you in and take your breath away. The ending...oh my God, the ending. You won't see it coming."
405,Breakfast of Champions,0385334206,Kurt Vonnegut Jr.,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"Anyone familiar with any of Kurt Vonnegut's works will not be disappointed by this classic satire. It features characters recurring in his novels - Kilgore Trout, Eliot Rosewater, and Rabo Karebakian - as well as fresh inventions, whose stories collude to turn any reader into a social cynic. The novel is narrated by Vonnegut, who directs his monologue at a reader unfamiliar with Earth and its customs. Because of that, he is compelled to frequently illustrate his point - whether it be with a sketch of a vagina or an electric chair - to great comic effect. Early in the book he states that he needs to empty his mind of useless clutter, which he would seem to do quite effectively, though what may seem to be a random outburst will be, without fail, a cleverly constructed social criticism. Readers familiar with works such as Slaughterhouse V will be pleasantly surprised to find that they already have a fair bit of background on Kilgore Trout, the protagonist, as well as Eliot Rosewater, whom one may remember shares a hospital room with Billy Pilgrim in Slaughterhouse. Kilgore becomes quite lovable in this installment. One of the more profound scenes occurs at the very end and features Vonnegut as character as well as narrator. He and Trout have an excellent dialog that I shall not spoil here. It is sufficient to say that it caps a very good point Vonnegut makes throughout the book regarding the control people have over their own actions. In summary, an excellent read."
405,Breakfast of Champions,0385334206,Kurt Vonnegut Jr.,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Nellix,"Breakfast of Champions was a book by Kurt Vonnegut.

That's really all I have to say about the book to make it what it is. It's impolite, but acceptable. It was meant to be both at the same time, and that's what it was. It was everywhere but on the page. There wasn't for one second when I was reading that book that I thought of it as a book. I thought of it as an idea, or a million different ideas, which I believe is the way that the book was meant to be taken. A different view for every subject that has a view.

What lots of people seem to say about this book is that it is a symbol for something. A story about the tragedies of war, of mental illness, about how life can change you, about coincidence. People try and find meaning in this book. They call it literature, and give it importance, and give it fancy titles and symbolism that is everything they think it is, that they want it to be, much like the lives of people in Midland City.

I believe this book was intended for everyone to read, if not for everyone to understand. It gives perspectives that only someone like Kurt Vonnegut would think of. That being, no one else.

The titles 'Breakfast of Champions' and 'Goodbye, Blue Monday' both fit the story if you read it. Seemingly interesting as well, to those who don't know the story behind it. Part of which is what made me pick it up.

The way that Kurt puts himself in his books to further the story is what gives them his personal style, and which is particularly evident in this novel of his. He isn't afraid to stray from the conventions of rules of grammar, or typical book structure. A drawing here and there to further illustrate the point gives it not meaning but voice.

Conventions aside; This story, this book, this philosophy gives thought, gives a closer look to aspects of daily life which most don't think about. And for those who aren't trying to look to deep into the pages, but just looking for something to pass the time, it's still a good read."
405,Breakfast of Champions,0385334206,Kurt Vonnegut Jr.,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Rutger-B,"Breakfast of Champions is a great book for Vonnegut lovers. It differentiates itself from his other books, and because of this it may be difficult to get into for those who don't admire Mr. Vonnegut. The reader can sense the care and emotion Vonnegut put into this novel as opposed to his others, such as Cat's Cradle. He clearly states his views and thoughts on society, art, and more specifically on literature. His life experiences have a healthy influence on this novel, but to make things more personal he gives his opinions on those experiences. You don't have to agree with them to appreciate this book. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves Vonnegut."

I bought both this book and the workbook. I have had this book for a week and already i am seeing drastic improvements in my drawing. It took me from being so unconfident in my work i didnt want to draw at all, to now showing it to all of my friends. It explains everything very well and it is so easy to understand. Even if you have never drawn anything in your life. This book boosts your confidence with just the first exercise! I recommend this to anyone who wants to draw.

The excercises are easy to follow, and the author has provided the psychological tools to help anyone draw with confidence. From the time I began reading to the time I finished the last excercise the results were astounding. I'd highly recommend it for anyone interested in drawing to use this book."
407,Bel Canto,0060838728,Ann Patchett,Barnes and Noble,3.9,review4U,Ms Patchett has successfully extends writing techniques developed by Jose Saramago (Nobel Prize in Portugal) and Gabriel Garcia Marquez. If you liked Blindness or One Hundred Years of Solitude you will love this book. Bel Canto is a masterpiece of writing with a very controlled technique that doesn't waver throughout the book. It tells the story of a disparate group of people taken hostage in a botched attempt to abduct the president of an unnamed South American country. The setting is the palatial home of the country's vice president where a famous soparano has come to sing as a birthday president for a Japanese industrialist. The author manages to easily juggle numerous points of view simultaneously and seamlessly so the story is told sympathetically threw the eyes of the terrorists and the hostages. The story is suspenseful but requires close reading and also workes as an unusual love story.
407,Bel Canto,0060838728,Ann Patchett,Barnes and Noble,3.9,alias_dw,"Bel Canto was a book assigned to me in a college English class focused on novels. This was the most traditional novel in the course yet the story was one of the most original. Bel Canto is a love story on every level. The plot revolves around a group of party goers taken hostage by South American rebels. The characters are complex and although they are all very different people they form close bonds, overcoming language barriers, the barrier of hostage taker and hostage, and socioeconomic barriers. Love is the catalyst that brings them together. Although this is a love story, its not a traditional love story. It is sometimes sensual but there are all kinds of love in Bel Canto. A good read."
407,Bel Canto,0060838728,Ann Patchett,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"Centered on the basics of Operatic Style, Bel Canto, is a well-written, passionate novel of chance. By including love, lust, and tragedy, Ann Patchett created this intense, lyrical novel. The events entailed within this novel are slightly based on true events which occurred during December 1996. For four months, 14 terrorists held hostages captive inside the Japanese Embassy of Lima, Peru. The novel depicts the passion and anger many of the hostages might have felt during those four months. The novel was directly inspired by the hostage's captivity.Starring Opera's famous Soprano, Roxanne Coss, Bel Canto opens with a bang. Katsumi Hosokawa had been in love with Roxanne's powerful voice since he developed his love of Opera. Today, he is a powerful owner of a Japanese Electronic company. Hosokawa's birthday was that evening. He wanted to celebrate and spend the evening listening to the beautiful melodies of Roxanne's voice. Hosokawa held his party at the mansion of the Vice-President of South America. Roxanne began singing one of the many pieces found in her repertoire. When suddenly, the lights go out, and the 200 foreign diplomats soon find themselves hostages of an unlikely group of young terrorists under the command of General Benjamin.The novel expands from that evening and continues for four months. The hostages eventually learn that they need to help one another in order to get through this crisis. The terrorists would not allow them to leave the mansion. They were watched cautiously. Many of the hostages began bonding with each other and formed friendships. Even the cold-hearted industrialist Mr. Hosokawa used his love of Opera to teach him how to socialize with other people. He forges a friendship with his idol Roxanne Coss. She also found it in her diva character to associate with other people.Through the four months, the captives are eventually granted more privileges from the terrorists. As ironic as it may be, the terrorists also befriend their hostages. Many of the people found inside the mansion change their demeanor. Those who were once shy and timid such as Ishmael learn to let their own voice be heard. The translator Gen Watanabe also learns to speak for himself and doesn't allow the language barrier found between the 200 foreign diplomats affect him. He finds his voice among the multiple languages he communicated with.Overall, Bel Canto is based on fate. Many of the characters were polar opposites, but with the given circumstances, they find their soul mates. Only with fate could a powerful professional man like Gen Watanabe fall in love with a young terrorist from a small village in Latin America. Destiny also brought Katsumi Hosokawa and Roxanne Coss together. Their friendship blossomed into an intense loving relationship with the hands of fate."
408,"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies",0739467352,Jared Diamond,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"I found it refreshing to read something which genuinely attempted to grasp the big picture of history. Ably dismissing the conceited and partisan theories of earlier generations (and of most people living today), Diamond proposes sensible scientific alternatives which carry the ring of truth, and apparently so self-evident that it seems amazing no one thought of them before. He isn't too concerned with the individuals and events which are the backbone of traditional histories. He won't explain why one or other political power in Europe gained the advantage in some situation. These are the fine details of the broader picture - and in a very real sense they don't affect the outcome of history. What Diamond wants to know is, for instance, why a steadfastly stone-age Europe was not colonised by gun-toting Native Americans. His ideas give a kind of tragic certainty to the history that we all know and I suspect that many will try to dismiss them as 'cultural determinism', as they have with other authors in this vein. If I have any criticism at all it is that Diamond rather labours the point, but this is not necessarily a bad thing with new and interesting ideas. This is an approach to history of which I would like to see a lot more - I could not put this book down. I have read most of the science books shortlisted for the 1998 Rhone-Poulenc prize and am very glad that this one won."
408,"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies",0739467352,Jared Diamond,Barnes and Noble,4,willyvan,"This is a remarkable and thought-provoking book, full of insights into our past.

At the end of the last ice age, in 11,000 BC, all peoples on all the continents were hunter-gatherers. Why the great subsequent differences? Biology? Different genetic endowments? No, it is not a matter of racial differences - there is only one human race, as Diamond shows.

Why did bronze tools appear early in parts of Eurasia, but late and only locally in the New World, and never in aboriginal Australia? Diamond answers that environmental geography lays down the conditions of economic and social development.

Eurasia is the world's largest and most diverse landmass. Diamond shows how its larger stock of domestic plants and animals gave it the lead, starting in southwest Asia's Fertile Crescent. Big-seeded annual cereals, like wheats (emmer and einkorn) and barley, were easy to domesticate, and Eurasia's wheats have a higher protein content than East Asia's rice or the New World's corn. 

Eurasia also had the largest number of wild mammalian species, 72 candidates for domestication. There were 14 ancient species of big herbivorous domestic animals: 13 were confined to Eurasia, one to South America. There were none in North America, Australia or sub-Saharan Africa. Eurasia had the unique combination of domesticable animals - sheep, goats, cows, pigs and dogs. Also, Eurasia's east-west axis enabled a swifter spread of crops and livestock across its 10,000-mile band of temperate latitudes. 

The ultimate cause of progress - food production - led to the proximate causes - germs, literacy, technology and centralised government. Guns, germs and steel are power factors.

But Diamond underestimates how empires seized their given advantages to attack, conquer and exploit other less fortunate peoples. And he tends to justify the current inequitable world order, as when he writes of, ""revolts . promising less oppression . all the misery still being caused by such struggles in the modern world."""
408,"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies",0739467352,Jared Diamond,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"""Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies"" is a very good book. The author's overall purpose of this book is to show how the tendencies of humans and the environmental influences on differing societies can be used to paint a general picture of the overall pattern of human development over time. He does this by providing countless examples of agricultural development, animal domestication, technological innovation, and the developments of societal structure on all 5 major continents: Africa, North America, South America, Eurasia (Europe and Asia), and Australia. Overall, Jack Diamond does a very good job in conveying and proving his intended message to the reader. He has an obviously profound understanding of human tendencies specifically all over the world. As a learning experience, I would recommend this book to someone who is wondering why human history has played out the way it has. It is very informational. A very good read."
409,Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe,0375508414,Fannie Flagg,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"I'm a fanatic of Fried Green Tomatoes. So, of course, I had to have the audio book, read by the author herself, Fannie Flagg. And she does not disappoint. Her southern drawl is cute and she knows how to act the lines (she was involved in the theater before jumping into writing).Although...for all those who know the movie and the book like the palm of their hand, a word of caution: you'll miss the actresses's voices (in the case of the movie) and many of the delicious details of the book that were left behind in this abridged version (like the catfish joke Idgie and Stump played on unsuspecting visitors and when Idgie first met Ruth and when Ruth went away). I think it's because reading verbatim from the book would've made it too long, but I still resent that they left so much out.This audio book is really for the hardcore fans. Anyone else will tire of it. But Fannie Flagg is delightful and it gives this CD that extra something when you know the woman who cooked this story up is telling you the story from her own lips.Buy this if you fell in love with Ruth and Idgie and Ninny and Evelyn. It'll add to the collection you probably already have revolving around Fried Green Tomatoes. I love the sotries that stick with you the rest of your life. My recommendations are exactly that."

She was brought up to be a ""good girl"" and do everything she was ""supposed"" to do, which was to marry a good man and become a wife and mother. She did, but now that her children are grown and out of the house, Evelyn is feeling that life has passed her by. She is realizing that the current world is so very different from the one she grew up in and she does not know how to cope. On top of that, she realizes that her relationship with her husband is drifting farther and farther apart. Many days, she sits at home alone, overeating and wishing for the courage to end her life.
Things begin to change when she meets Cleo Threadgood, a resident at a local Alabama nursing home. Cleo regales Evelyn with stories of her family and friends, growing up in a small town named Whistle Stop, Alabama. Through these stories and numerous visits with Cleo, Evelyn begins to reevaluate her life and discover for the first time, the kind of woman that she wants to become.
This is my favorite book. I suppose it resonated so well with me because I read it for the first time when I was in college, trying to figure out who I was, much like Ruth. There are strong themes of hope, resilience, perseverance, and change, in this story. I never get tired of reading this book because the author writes with such passion and poignancy that it draws me in every time. As stated earlier, these characters feel like friends who I want to visit over and over."

The movie did not cover the Whistle Stop weekly news bites, and the ending is a little different than the movie (I can see why they did what they did though).  Deep south recipes are included (yes, fried green tomatoes too)."

412,The Five Love Languages: How to Express Heartfelt Commitment to Your Mate,1881273156,Gary Chapman,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Pegasuss,"7 Months ago (May 2009) and after almost 17 years of marriage, my wife and I were ready to call it quits.  The love for each other was gone and for all intents and purposes, we were little more than glorified roommates, and not even good ones at that.  Although we were not officially divorced by the courts, emotionally, spiritually and physically we WERE divorced ~ bankrupted in our relationship.  During the summer as we struggled with how, or even IF we wanted to continue being married, a dear family member gave me this book and asked me to read it.  I told my wife what I was learning and it piqued her interest.  She began to see some real changes in how I treated her (Her love languages are Acts of Service and Gifts).  As I read through this book, and discovered my love language(s) (and hers as well), it became apparent to me that this author had stumbled across something that I believe could and does STOP divorce in its tracks if people would read this book and apply its principles to heart for themselves and for their partners.  If my wife and I can take a dead marriage and turn it into the best we have ever had using these principles anyone can.  Will it stop infidelity or abusive behavior of a spouse?  The answer to those particular situations have to be dealt with at a personal and spiritual level and although this book does not specifically deal with those issues, it does offer tremendous guidance in learning to love your spouse the way he/she feels love.  God can and WILL save your marriage and this book can help you understand what a true loving partnership is about and why we need each other interdependently in this life and in our marriage.  My wife has since commented after finishing this book that it should be required reading for anyone contemplating getting married.  It truly is THAT powerful.  I know many today are hurting and struggling in their marriages and having gone through that fire, my heart truly breaks for others in similar situations.  It is tough thing to separate your life from someone you once loved.  I can only say for myself having learned and put Gary's suggestions into practice, that I have seen a difference in how my wife and I now love each other. There is hope.  READ this book and give it to your partner!  Test the principles that Gary Chapman provides and see if you don't see a change in how your partner responds (lovingly) to you and begin to have the best marriage of your life. Best hopes for the readers in discovering your partners Love Language and a new found love for each other."
412,The Five Love Languages: How to Express Heartfelt Commitment to Your Mate,1881273156,Gary Chapman,Barnes and Noble,4.5,jas527,"If you can read, you can understand the love in your marriage. This book is a simple and easy to read. It gave me the basic tools that I needed to understand my wife, ex-wife, and our children. Learn your love language and stop talking at one another. You can stop talking altogether. Start communicating in the language that your spouse has always spoken, and learn to articulate yours. My life would be different if I had read this book either. I can not change the past, but I am better prepared for the wonderful future ahead."
412,The Five Love Languages: How to Express Heartfelt Commitment to Your Mate,1881273156,Gary Chapman,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"The Five Love Languages (TFLL) by Gary Chapman is probably the most useful book on relationships ever written. 
 
While the title expounds by saying ""how to express heartfelt commitment to your mate"", its usefulness in application doesn't stop there.  The lessons learned in TFLL can, and should, be applied in all relationships--not just romantic ones.  Learning how friends, extended family, and those whom one works with closely expect to receive and express love (or exchange love with appreication, gratitude, admiration, motivation, etc.)will enhance those relationships tremendously.  

I have also found the lessons learned from TFLL to be valuable for empowering, inspiring and motivating others to fulfill their potential in working relationships.  If you have ever worked with one of those ""difficult people"", then the lessons in TFLL will help in identifying how you can apply a different tactic to capture their attention and empower them.  Learning that the reasons why people do certain things are often out of expectations that differ from our own will certainly go along way in helping to adjust our own actions/reactions to others' actions/reactions, and in the end, just might help enhance the working relationship with those colleagues.  
  
Learning that different people have different priorities in expressing and receiving love (again: or admiration, appreciation, etc.), that we should't project our own love language priorities on others, and that we should express love/appreciation/gratitude in a manner that will be most meaningful to each other, will inspire more meaningful exchanges and enhance our relationships.  

In short, if their are people in your life that you wish to insure you have the best relationship possible with, then you should read this book and apply all of the suggestions for learning the priority of their individual love languages--right after you figure out your own order.  

It's actually fun to figure out your own love language and then try to guess what the order of love languages will be for your mate, friends, family, and co-workers."

414,Little Bee,1416589643,Chris Cleave,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Frisbeesage,"Little Bee by Chris Cleave is the story of what happens when the lives of Sarah, a British magazine editor and Little Bee, a Nigerian teenager collide. The resulting conflict is spectacular and stunning. This is an eye-opening , devastating book told from the perspectives of these two very different women, neither of whom can turn a blind eye to the tragedies taking place around them.This was a hard book for me to read. The jacket blurb in no way prepares you for what is coming and the story, though it leaves you with some hope, is ultimately very sad. However, this is a book that you need to read, if only to be more aware of what is happening in other parts of the world and how little we are doing to stop these tragedies. Maybe this book will persuade more people to follow Sarah's example and refuse to turn a blind eye."
414,Little Bee,1416589643,Chris Cleave,Barnes and Noble,3.6,prenoun,"""Little Bee"" is beautifully written, filled with lines and imagery to dogear and revisit. Two very powerful female leads -- Nigerian immigrant Little Bee and English professional Sarah Summers -- carry the novel, as their lives overlap amid a kind of violence that is hard for sheltered Westerners to imagine, in moments whose depth is obvious, but whose repercussions neither is able to predict. As Little Bee aptly puts it, ""Horror in your country is something you take a dose of to remind yourself that you are not suffering from it.""

An excellent counterpoint to the current anti-immigration fervor, that will sadly escape (or intellectually outpace) the audience that needs to read it most."
414,Little Bee,1416589643,Chris Cleave,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Anonymous,"The dexterity with which Cleave, a male author, writes these two women - Sarah and Little Bee - is nothing short of miraculous. The prose is both beautiful and approachable, and the range of emotions I felt while reading made me want to not put the book down. It is the only book I'm recommending to my friends and family. I'm a non-stop reader, and this is truly one of the best books I've ever come across. I highly, highly recommend it."

She can't stand her life anymore and it's all because of the accident where she lost her whole family, the accident which was all her fault. 
Now Ever has the strange psychic powers that allow her to see auras, read minds, and know people's life stories just by touching them. Most teens would love powers like that. Not Ever. Ever can't stand them and she only wants them to go away. And finally they do.
When Ever meets Damen he quiets everything around her. She can't see his aura, read his thoughts, or know his life story. She can finally be herself. Things seem to be great with Damen until he starts acting very weird and strange people start showing up and going missing.
Ever was a great character and so were her friends. Miles and Haven are hilarious. I think they really helped lighten the mood of the book when things started to get dark. It's always good to have some contrast in a book and I think they really provided it with a gay actor and a love starved goth chick. I also think that they were amazingly well-developed for background characters."

When I pick up a book that is like that i get involved in the story. I felt like I was right beside Ever and Damen. The love story that lasts forever.

417,The Thirteenth Tale,0743298020,Diane Setterfield,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,I read this book for our book club. It was captivating after the first 30 pages or so. The writing style is beautiful and it kept me wondering throughout the book. I usually can figure out the twists and mysteries as I read- but this was really different and fascinating to the end!My book club loved it as well. It was really interesting discussing it and most of us went home and read it again!
417,The Thirteenth Tale,0743298020,Diane Setterfield,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"Some books get a 'WOW', some books get a 'spectacular', and some books just defy any term to describe the powerful emotions one feels after finishing the last word, on the last page of a book. THE THIRTEENTH TALE by Diane Setterfield is just one of those 'once every so often' powerhouse reads!!!     Combine the atmosphere and timeless style of a classic Bronte's' JANE EYRE, or any Charles Dickens's novel.  Mix in the new creativity of the more recent bestsellers, Carlos Ruiz Zafon's THE SHADOW OF THE WIND, Gregory Maguire's WICKED, and Audrey Niffenegger's THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE.  Finally add the wonderment of a tale of Cinderella's child, or any other tale that has yet to be told. AND----You may just rise to the level of Setterfield's THE THIRTEENTH TALE!!      This is a magical tale, unlike any other, about a young girl, Margaret Lea, who is living and working in an antiquarian books store with her loving father and emotionally absent mother.  She is called upon to fulfill the request of writing the 'true' biography of the singularly fanciful , morbidly mysterious, and ever illusive popular tale writer, Vita Winter. Both women seemed to have tragically lost a twin, and maintain a flair for the dramatic in their thoughts and actions. As Margaret visits Miss Winter to listen to her life story and pursue her mission for Miss Winter, a most exciting and unique tale emerges.      Similar to many fairy tales, yet eerie in its emerging truths, Setterfield creates a story of her own that will keep readers and book clubs breathless for more and more!! This book is such an all encompassing read because it engages the senses, the intellect, and the emotions.  Reading the last word on the last page is both joyful and heartbreaking. A wonderfully, complete story has emerged but there is a real taste for needing more and more for the reader. The mysterious lives and incidents in these two women's stories ebbed ,and grew, and flowered in my mind with an all consuming passion until I felt that I knew them as completely as I know myself.     As Diane Setterfield says through Vita Winters--'Everyone has a story'--and as promised, Setterfield tells a stupendous one in her book, THE THIRTEENTH TALE.  How can this possible be a first time story by this author?  Readers will finish this book and be impatiently awaiting a new one from her immediately!!!"
417,The Thirteenth Tale,0743298020,Diane Setterfield,Barnes and Noble,4.2,BeaderReader,"What a fantastic book written with the atmosphere of a different age. If you are a fan of Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, etc. (and who isn't) you simply MUST read this engaging novel. It pulled me completely in and I felt just like Margaret--never wanting to leave the world and companionship of my newfound friends at Angelfield. More please, Ms. Setterfield!"

I LOVED the Twilight Saga and have been crazy for that whole series but I was not expecting the thrill and the way I connected to the characters in this series! It has been a wonderful series to read and I'm SO excited for the next book to come out. I read the first 4 books all in one week because I was that excited and wanted more, more and more! I cried, laughed, got angry and clapped! I have the HIGHEST hopes Richelle Mead will not let us down and find some way for Roza (as Dimitri puts it) and her true love Dimitri back together and I'm hoping it comes from the grand healing of Lissa! Rose can be bonded to 2 people...Lissa and Dimitri...how awesome to have them all together. I'm also hoping that dream Rose had with Dimitri being together in the end...is fulfilled in the next book. The twists and turns (Rose's dad) in this series was just incredible and unpredictable. I can NOT see Rose with anyone else...Richelle made that connection between the two of them SO REAL and connected that they shouldn't be with anyone else...just can't see it. I love the dynamics between Rose/Dimitri (soul mates they are) and Rose/Lissa (bond mates). This book should be a movie as other comments have been mentioned. It is a vampire type book but it far more in depth with its characters and they are not just plain old ""vamps""...awesome books! It would be an outstanding movie! The characters are young and some are older, which is great for us older people who can connect on a different level. Counting the days down for book #5!"
418,"Spirit Bound (Vampire Academy, #5)",1595142509,Richelle Mead,Barnes and Noble,4.7,thalia_lover,"i think that this series will definitely keep you interested. i love how Rose handles things, because it is real. she struggles with decisions and with her temper at times like a normal person would and i think that makes the book easier for young teens to relate too. I also think that this book is unique among others because you think you know what will happen, but then it ends up completely different. And Rose herself acts just like alot of teens these days and i believe that something can be learned from here :) 
And as she struggles with her loves in this series she handles it the way anyone would. but she also has priority over her feelings because she cannot just run into their arms. She has to fight her own battles and make her own mistakes and that is something ever has to do :)"

Yes,Dimitri,but I won't tell what happens with him!I also enjoyed seeing a new side to Queen Tatiana,not a side I EVER expected.There was twists and turns I never expected to see there and was not preditable like alot of vampire books!The ending left with a BIG cliffhanger that left my heart racing,palms sweating,and me craving more!

This is series is definantely up in the top two! I really love Rose as a character. She is what made me keep reading from the first book! She is like what some girls and women should be like! Strong, funny, the first to defend her friends, a total smart a s s! lol I really liked all of that about her. BUT in this book Ricehelle Mead made her seem so so so weak! I mean to me she just didn't seem like the same Rose Hathaway that all the readers know and love. I mean Ms. Mead made her the one thing that she truely hated: a blood whore. I mean come on!!! Geez! I would have never expected that one to happen! 
The other thing I didn't like was how she couldn't do the one thing she set out to do: save Dimitri! I mean I know that would be hard but I thught Rose could do anything........ I really hope that her and Adrian get together! lol He is a really great character because he is soooo unpredictable sometimes! Rose really has a thing for him! 

Over all good book but a little disapointing. But I still can't wait for the next book! I checked Ms. Mead's website and the NEXT BOOK is scheduled to come out MAY 18, 2010!* Most likely subject to change but at least we have some kind of idea when the next one is coming! HAPPY READING TO ALL! =]"
419,"Blood Promise (Vampire Academy, #4)",1595141987,Richelle Mead,Barnes and Noble,4.7,randomness1776,"BLOOD PROMISE is a great teen novel, Rose Hatahway is going through some serious soul searching in this book, as she's left behind Lissa, who she has promised to guard and her honest to goodness best friend for life (Lissa brought Rose back from the death, doesn't get anymore lasting than that), and has gone to Siberia to find and destory her former mentor and lover Dimitri, who is now a souless, undead Strigoi: think classic vampire myths.
Rose comes across Dimitri's family and finds in them the kind of family she's always thought she wanted (excepting the crazy-yet hilarious grandmother). It sidetracks her, but Abe, the mob-boss esque Moroi (described as dressing like a pimp or a pirate, just one who looks like he could brake your kneecaps), warns her to get out of Siberia. She doesn't listen to him of course, but does leave the town and Dimitri's family to continue her quest. 
Don't worry about Lissa though, as Rose often slips into her head and we get to see plenty of her, Christian and Adrian, as well as what Academy drama is being stirred up.
We get plenty of new characters as well: Sydney the uptight Alchemist who you'll (hopefully) come to like, Avery who is a new friend of Lissa's at the Academy, Abe who I mentioned already, plus a shadow-kissed couple, Dimitri's family and a few minor characters as well.
The ending is a serious dun-dun-duuuuuun cliff hanger, where Rose is on the verge of her next big adventure, but she appears poised to take it on.
 THE POINT: great book: butt-kicking action, character development, can't wait for the next book."

If The Notebook was a sad story then this one will leave you crying for hours. With the love between Theresa and Garrett, the ending of the book seems to take a dramatic twist that you would have never seen coming from the first time that Theresa met Garrett. This was a book that I enjoyed to read and found out that once I picked up the book I couldn't put it down. The ending might have been tragic but the overall theme seems to remain clear. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has lost a love before, or even fallen in love. Sparks always finds that way to leaving you weeping at the end.

421,The Paris Wife,0345521307,Paula McLain,Barnes and Noble,3.9,GEORGIAMOON,"The Paris Wife is the story of Ernest Hemingway's first of four marriages. It is told from Hadley Richardson's point of view. Hadley and Hemingway were married in 1921 and gave birth to his first son, John Hadley Nicanor ""Jack"" Hemingway in 1923. His nickname was ""Bumby"" and Mariel and Margaux Hemingway were his daughters.
This is a wonderful read that gives us a new perspective of Ernest Hemingway's genius and life. This is a characterization of a flawed man through the eyes of his young, shy, pretty first wife. The Nobel Prize winning author appreciated the stability and grounding his wife had given him and later, after three other wives said of her...""I wish I had died before I loved anyone but her. She was the best and truest and loveliest person I have ever known."" Those words made me tingle all over."
421,The Paris Wife,0345521307,Paula McLain,Barnes and Noble,3.9,BookHounds,"I was never a fan of Hemingway, but have always intrigued by his larger than life personality.  Paula McLain has weaved a wondrous blend of fact and fiction to bring the story behind Hemingway's first wife and love Elizabeth Hadley Richardson.  If you look at pictures of Hadley from her youth, you can see her looks very clearly in her granddaughters, Mariel and Margaux.  I imagine she must have been stunning with an amazing personality and sense of humor to capture Hemingway's heart so thoroughly.  McLain's theorizes these ideas fully in this fictional account of their romance based on letters, written accounts and Hemingway's story, The Sun Also Rises, based on his own experiences.

This book is for anyone looking to revisit The Cafe Society in Paris during the 1920's.  I got the feeling that while Hadley loved her husband dearly, she didn't really fit in with Cafe society since the lax morals didn't suit her upbringing.  It is fascinating to read how she dealt with Hemingway's affairs and the fact that he brought his soon to be mistress, Pauline, into his home life.  Hemingway must have been like a rock start in that world.  It must have been amazing to live through such a time period.

I am such a huge fan of books like this, that take fact and work out the details so a story can unfold.  It reminded me of Loving Frank by Nancy Horan which I adored.  It even makes me want to go back and reread Hemingway's work.  Of course, this story couldn't have been written without the famous characters and it is a fascinating romantic tale. I received this book from the publisher at no expense in exchange for my honest review."
421,The Paris Wife,0345521307,Paula McLain,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Elsie_Brooks,"Paula McLain takes her reader on a voyeuristic journey into the dispair that haunted Hemingway. Through the voice of his first wife, Hadley,she shares the dark side of the much glorified bohemian lifestyle of American expatriates in Paris during the 1920s. 

McLain's writing has a beautiful simplicity. She creates for her reader a sense that she is Hadley and The Paris Wife is her memoir."
423,"The Elite (The Selection, #2)",0062059963,Kiera Cass,Barnes and Noble,4.5,dear_prudence,"I purchased this at midnight on my Nook. I told myself I was only going to read 50 pages or so and then go to sleep. I am now at work with a pounding headache and blurry eyes because of course 50 pages was not enough and I ended up reading the entire thing by 5am. It was so, so worth it though! I should start by saying that I am Team Maxon all the way, so all the little American/Maxon moments just made my heart flutter. I don't want to give away any details, so I'm not going to say much about what happened. I lot of interesting developments/twists. The only thing that bothered me is that I feel like there's so much we still don't know about the rebels and who they are or what their purpose is. Otherwise, I sincerely loved The Elite! Can't wait until the next book!"

This is book 2 in the &lsquo;The Selection&rsquo; series, and picks up where book 1 left off.
The 35 girls of &lsquo;The Selection&rsquo; have been reduced to just 6, and it&rsquo;s time for America to not only work to keep her place in the game, but to also make a decision as to who she really wants to be with &ndash; Prince Maxon, or her childhood sweetheart Aspen
The competition is also heating up, with some unexpected events, and more rebel action.
What do the rebels want? Who will be sent home next? And who will America choose?


Beautiful and captivating, this book had me from the very first page!

I loved &lsquo;The Selection&rsquo;, and I was so excited to finally have a copy of &lsquo;The Elite&rsquo; to read, and I really was not disappointed. America continued to be not only the underdog of the competition, but also the one who truly seemed to have captivated the prince&rsquo;s heart. Her heart seemed to be in the right place in that she was always doing what seemed right to her, even if the things she did endeared her more to the lower castes than the king.

The romance in this book was quite sweet, but I really wanted America to just make a decision and stick with it! It seemed obvious how America and Maxon felt about each other, so the fact that he was off flirting with the other 5 girls in the selection, and she was still making out with Aspen was a bit annoying! I really wanted Maxon to just propose, and send the other girls home instead of them constantly seeming to play games with each others feelings.  America also wore something which linked her to Aspen which for me was a really stupid thing to do, and the way she kept asking for more time was irritating too!
I have to say that if America and Maxon don&rsquo;t end up together by the end of this series I will be really annoyed!

I liked the storyline in this book, and although America was a little immature and indecisive at times I couldn&rsquo;t help but love this story. I don&rsquo;t know what it is about these books but I really love the way they are written, and I actually think that &lsquo;The Elite&rsquo; was better than &lsquo;The Selection&rsquo;!

Overall; I really loved this book, and although America had her faults, I hated to put this down! Can&rsquo;t wait for book 3!!! I want it now!!!
9 out of 10."
424,The Name of the Rose,0156001314,"Umberto Eco, William Weaver, Se??n Barrett",Barnes and Noble,4.1,DrJimC,"This is an excellent book, but I feel it useful to provide editing feedback in this early stage of eBooks.  The maps of the abbey and the library are poorly transferred to the eBook format.  In both cases, only the upper left corner of each of these maps are visible on the BN nook.  This does not seriously detract from this fantastic novel, but I was disappointed by the seeming lack of effort to format these images appropriately for the nook."
424,The Name of the Rose,0156001314,"Umberto Eco, William Weaver, Se??n Barrett",Barnes and Noble,4.1,william_deeds,"If I were asked which book had greatly impacted my intellectuality, I would say it was ""The Name of the Rose"" by Umberto Eco.  Even though the book was very challenging and complex, the literary elements used (in the novel) made it a very well written book.  It entertained me for five complete days in which I was successfully forced to isolate myself from the world, only to live this medieval experience at its best.  After reading those exhausting first 100 pages (that were the most challenging from the entire book) in which the abbey was being described with excessive detail, I really got hooked up even more.  The plot advanced extremely fast after these first 100 pages, and before I even knew it, I was finishing the novel with tremendous pride.  After reading ""The Name of the Rose"" everything was worth it; all my time, my effort, etc. invested gave their respective ""healthy fruits"".

Many appropriate elements in the book, not seen in any other book, successfully made me feel as if I were part of the most intriguing era: the medieval era.  The Latin phrases disseminated throughout the text, the magnificent descriptions of the abbey, the historical context in which this book took place in, but especially, the ideas expressed in the book, were the elements that made this book superior from the others to such a level that a movie was made to fulfill the vast excellence of this work (although the movie is not as good as the book).  The author also used an opportune book structure throughout the text that was historically used by the medieval intellectuals (the scholars).  When they wrote books, the medieval scholars used summaries at the beginning of each chapter, and this made me feel (even more) as if I were part of the medieval era.  

All the ideas, superstitions, beliefs, etc, exposed in the book really made me think seriously.  It is extremely interesting how the author combined religion and philosophy in the book.  For instance, the blind scholar Jorge of Burgos feverously made a very profound point about religion that came in hand with the philosophy of life (or existentialism).  Jorge played a huge roll in the novel using, as a justification for his actions, the seriousness of life (not laughing at anything since it is a great offense to God).  This was the main point (with many more) were philosophy and religion of the medieval era fought against each other, and this combination really left me pondering a lot.  Besides this, the book carried out the idea of history throughout its plot, which I really liked. This historical consistency seen throughout the novel gave me a very high-quality history lesson about a specific part of the medieval era.  

This is a very well written book that should be read only when you feel intellectually and physically strong enough (since this book is not that simple and requires quite a lot of time).  I sincerely recommend, and it's a must read book. Waste no more time, and READ IT NOW!"

This book makes people see the other side of an addict, they can really get to know alice in the book. And not just as a drug addit but as a person who is struggling to be a better person for herself and for her family. 

I think everyone should read this fantastic book."
425,Go Ask Alice,1416914633,"Beatrice Sparks, Anonymous",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Sara-Stewart,"Most of us know by now that this is not a ""true"" diary, but a fiction. Nevertheless, it's highly entertaining as a cautionary tale of drugs and a teenage descent into hell. It reminds me a lot of the German film, CHRISTIANE F. -- another story of a downward spiral into oblivion due to drugs. In many ways, it also reminds me of a 1970s' ""movie of the week"" -- and in fact a movie does exist of this (and it even features William Shatner); though I haven't seen it. 

This is a terrific book for those with a morbid curiosity (like myself) about drug addiction and runaways. It's a dark entertainment and a dark fantasy that poses the question: What if? (What if I allowed myself to go there?)

It's like a death wish in many ways. But I do recommend it -- I kept wanting to see how far it would go -- and if it would end tragically. Some have found the writing to be less than spectacular, but I don't care: I was fine with it. For a so-called ""young adult"" book, it's edgy. 

It's also a period piece in many ways. A peek into the drug culture during the late hippy days (not to sound disparaging). It has that hippy culture-gone-bad vibe.

Recommended (for unconventional readers)."

After reading Confederacy, one never encounters the wackiness of life without asking, ""What would Ignatius do?""  This book, testimony to Toole's brave genius, takes aim at the twin inanities of multiculturalism and political correctness, years before they fouled our national consciousness.  Don't get me wrong. Toole is absolutely fair and even-handed: everybody gets theirs in this fearless and funny book.  The plot is tight.  The action is fast-paced.  The characters are memorable.

426,A Confederacy of Dunces,0802130208,"John Kennedy Toole, Walker Percy",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Atticus_Caufield,"I'll say it: Reading A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole wasn't always a pleasant experience for me. I was equal parts sympathetic, frustrated, and just outright incredulous at the actions of its main character, Ignatius J. Reilly. In truth, that is probably a testament to Kennedy Toole's unique voice and vision of a well-drawn character never before seen in the likes of literature. It's what Kennedy Toole doesn't say about Reilly and his thought process that becomes most frustrating and compelling. Is he just really very spoiled and sheltered? Completely out of touch? Mentally ill? It's all left up in the air like some of the best poetry, and spaces are left for the reader to bring their own meaning to the proceedings.

A Confederacy of Dunces isn't the most compelling read as far as plot development or symbolism. You're more likely to glean more meaning from Aesop's Fables, but it should be required reading to experience a unique voice and style, and just one more facet of American Literature.

The story, so detailed throughout, ends abruptly, and this reader thinks the story would've continued on or spawned a sequel, had the author not tragically ended his own life. Which begs another question, of course...how much of John Kennedy Toole lives in Ignatius?"

The green earflaps, full of large ears and uncut hair and the fine bristles that grew in the ears themselves, stuck out on either side like turn signals indicating two directions at once. Full, pursed lips protruded beneath the bushy black moustache and, at their corners, sank into little folds filled with disapproval and potato chip crumbs.'    Meet Ignatius J. Reilly, the hero of John Kennedy Toole's tragicomic tale, A Confederacy of Dunces. This 30-year-old medievalist lives at home with his mother in New Orleans, pens his magnum opus on Big Chief writing pads he keeps hidden under his bed, and relays to anyone who will listen the traumatic experience he once had on a Greyhound Scenicruiser bound for Baton Rouge. ('Speeding along in that bus was like hurtling into the abyss.') But Ignatius's quiet life of tyrannizing his mother and writing his endless comparative history screeches to a halt when he is almost arrested by the overeager Patrolman Mancuso--who mistakes him for a vagrant--and then involved in a car accident with his tipsy mother behind the wheel. One thing leads to another, and before he knows it, Ignatius is out pounding the pavement in search of a job.    Over the next several hundred pages, our hero stumbles from one adventure to the next. His stint as a hotdog vendor is less than successful, and he soon turns his employers at the Levy Pants Company on their heads. Ignatius's path through the working world is populated by marvelous secondary characters: the stripper Darlene and her talented cockatoo  the septuagenarian secretary Miss Trixie, whose desperate attempts to retire are constantly, comically thwarted  gay blade Dorian Greene  sinister Miss Lee, proprietor of the Night of Joy nightclub  and Myrna Minkoff, the girl Ignatius loves to hate. The many subplots that weave through A Confederacy of Dunces are as complicated as anything you'll find in a Dickens novel, and just as beautifully tied together in the end. But it is Ignatius--selfish, domineering, and deluded, tragic and comic and larger than life--who carries the story. He is a modern-day Quixote beset by giants of the modern age. His fragility cracks the shell of comic bluster, revealing a deep streak of melancholy beneath the antic humor. John Kennedy Toole committed suicide in 1969 and never saw the publication of his novel. Ignatius Reilly is what he left behind, a fitting memorial to a talented and tormented life"

If I wasn't at work while reading this (through e-mail from dailyreader.net) I would have found myself laughing quite loudly. The only thing I wish it had done better is not ended.

427,The Importance of Being Earnest,158049580X,Oscar Wilde,Barnes and Noble,4.2,KLmesoftly on LibraryThing,"This farce follows the entanglements of two men, each posing as a man named ""Earnest"" in order to woo a woman.  It's the only written work that's ever had me laughing out loud in public--Oscar Wilde is an incredibly witty man.  He makes great use of snappy banter, the occasional satirical reference to real-world social issues, and puns (such as the one in the title itself), but never comes on too strong, as many comedies can tend to do.  If you've never read Wilde before, this is an excellent place to start."

Instantly i became hooked. I loved the mythology and the action. So, I'm more than excited that he is following up with his series. And need-less to say i cannot wait for the new book to come out.

And i just wanted to know if anyone else wanted to see what would happen if percy's world and sadie and carter's world collided an ten they were in the same book!!!??? I think there would be tons of epic battles as each side tried to show the other side that their gods were real too. Talk about best-selling books!!!!
428,"The Mark of Athena (The Heroes of Olympus, #3)",1423140605,Rick Riordan,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Anonymous,"I bought this book at about 10:00 am. I just gone reading it, at 10:00 pm. Overall, I loved this book all the way through, and in my opinion is the best book Mr. Riordan has written so far in his mythological stories. The characters are totally realistic teenagers, and some moments, I sympathized, and empathized with them. Many times during reading I have laughed out loud, or cried with the characters. I felt like I was part of every moment. I will definitely read this again and I hope the next book, lives up to this one. The next book has big shoes to fill, but I think Mr. Riordan manage it."
429,"The Color of Magic (Discworld, #1; Rincewind #1)",0060855924,Terry Pratchett,Barnes and Noble,4,Kasia_S,"I've been collecting the Discworld books in no particular order for a few years now, mostly because my father always had an affinity for them and recommended them as hilarious and entertaining at the same time. Now that I finally got to read the first in the series I can see what the fuss is all about! There is plenty of humor, dry wit and magic, extremely complex scientific and fantastic themes and myriad of characters brighter than all the rainbows and flowers in the world combined. My head was spinning after few pages but somehow I couldn't stop reading; this incredible journey that Pratchett invites the reader on takes some time to get adjusted to, but once I let my mind go and read it slow, it all melted into a fantasy like no other. I can't really imagine kids reading it unless they are prodigies at understanding language because their little brains might pop from the amount of information given; I know mine was taken for a spin a few times! So here we are, visiting a world that exists as a flat disc with water walling over the edges, carried by four giant elephants standing on an ancient turtle, covered in meteor holes and all sorts of space debris, swimming who knows where....In one of it's cities, Ankh-Morpork , a failed wizard by the name of Rincewind comes across Twoflower, a traveling little man with magical luggage, carved out of rare sapient pear tree that follows him everywhere on its tiny feet. Yes walking luggage, with teeth too, guarding his master and providing lots of entertainment through out the story. The two men are the only ones in the whole city who speak the same language and thus their zany adventures start. Hastily hired as a guide the magician, who sucks at magic but it awfully funny and likable, gets into all sorts of troubles with trolls, dragons, islands with lunatics chased by Death itself without trying to loose poor Twoflower who thinks the whole adventure as a great sight seeing trip, they escape all sorts of scenarios that take them form the murkiest depths of underwater caves into far away galaxies in deep space. Seems like a lot and it is, but the novel takes all sorts of turns ad twists and one never knows what awaits our heroes on the next page. When Gods play magic dice and Fate and Death are in talks of getting them, our characters have a lot at stake and loosing such charming little fellows would certainly be horrible so the reader is constantly kept on a tight leash as the beauty of the story and its intricate pattern morphs into more fantastic scenarios. I can't even clearly say what this book is about other than being simply fantastic, albeit very complex. Folklore, mythology, fairy tales, comedy and drama, it's all here exquisitely woven for those who dare. - Kasia S."

429,"The Color of Magic (Discworld, #1; Rincewind #1)",0060855924,Terry Pratchett,Barnes and Noble,4,BrettJamen,"The Color of Magic is to Fantasy novels what The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is to Science Fiction.

430,Kafka on the Shore,1400079276,"Haruki Murakami, Philip Gabriel",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"The style of the book reminded me a bit of Kurt Vonnegut's style. I read it within 3 days and I keep thinking about it. Although everything isn't answered in the story, I think it's enough to keep the reader more than satisfied (after all it makes the reader think about it more). It's so different from the other things I've been reading lately that I just find it refreshing and intriguing."
430,Kafka on the Shore,1400079276,"Haruki Murakami, Philip Gabriel",Barnes and Noble,4.2,CR-Buell,"Murakami is one of our greatest living authors, and in my opinion this is his masterpiece.  Kafka on the Shore is so beautiful and so surreal it will leave you haunted for days.  The characters are so masterfully crafted that they will become a part of you.  The existentialist themes are so profound that they will change you.  This book is designed to make you think, and more importantly, to make you feel.  And it does both those things, powerfully."
430,Kafka on the Shore,1400079276,"Haruki Murakami, Philip Gabriel",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Breeze_in_Austin,"Escaping the bounds of reality seems so simple in this amazing book by Japanese author Haruki Murakami, one of today's most original and mind-bending writers.  The translation from Japanese to English is absolutely stunning as the language is both vivid and detailed.  Following the story of a 15-year old boy as he finds his way through the mysteries of life, Murakami crafts a story that jolts the reader from concrete feelings to far-fetched imagery.  Let go of what you expect and know of the world and allow yourself to venture into this meandering tale full of surprising twists and turns.  Murakami's greatest feat is his ability to make what is surely impossible seem so real and lifelike - from a man who can talk to cats, to strange characters who resemble familiar characters from modern day product marketing like Johnny Walker and Colonel Sanders.  The tale is told in such a way as to suggest a dreamlike state where life isn't what you expect, and is much more vivid than we normally allow.  

Not a love story, exactly.  Not a coming of age parable, either.  Not a thriller or mystery.  And yet, it weaves together elements of all of these into one masterful piece of writing that will keep you glued to the pages.  Set in modern-day Japan, the story is filled with contemporary references, making the situations seem entirely plausible.  But as the plot twists and meanders, it is clear that what you are reading requires a suspension of reality and a willingness to take in the well-crafted writing as merely a different way to see things.  

Kafka Tamura finds love and adventure as he fights to uncover the power of his father's oedipal prophecy.  As he travels Japan as a runaway, he finds himself wondering if his path is chosen for him as fate, or if he is living a life of coincidence.  While wondering, but not searching, for the mother who left him as a young child, his only sister gone with her, he discovers much more than he bargained for.  

Having lived in Japan, the descriptions of the people and the places immediately drew me back to times spent in this friendly, yet oftentimes exotic locale.  Reading Kafka on the Shore made Japan seem less foreign, and more strange at the same time.  The language is compelling, even as it has been translated to English - a notable feat not generally achieved.  

Murakami will be regarded as one of the world's most unique and creative fiction writers and Kafka on the Shore is the perfect example of all he brings to the written page."
431,"Red Dragon (Hannibal Lecter, #1)",0525945563,Thomas Harris,Barnes and Noble,4.3,ChesterfieldWatts,"This is the true masterpiece of an author more well-known for a different book. I read ""Red Dragon"" before reading ""Silence of the Lambs"" or seeing any of the movies. I could not put it down, and it kept me on the edge of my seat. When I saw the movies, I was disappointed by the way they failed to capture the suspense Thomas Harris creates in the book. The characters are richly developed, and Harris makes it very easy to empathize with the characters. Whether you have seen the movies or not, this is a great read. The writing is masterful, and the characters are richer and more developed than in ""Silence of the Lambs."" A great book for those looking for a suspenseful read."
431,"Red Dragon (Hannibal Lecter, #1)",0525945563,Thomas Harris,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"Thomas Harris has been one of those pleasant suprises for me.  I only read 'Red Dragon' because my wife was busy reading and praising 'Hannibal'and I am not a patient man. The central plot of the book involves two FBI types, Jack Crawford (of 'Silence of the Lambs') and Will Graham ( a retired civilian specialist with a knack for catching serial killers)chasing one Francis Dolarhyde, a bonafide twisted soul who kills families. The narrative prose is elegant, effortless and exciting and presents the case and the chase in a style so smooth and transparent that Harris hardly ever gets in the way of his own writing. I have always liked this ability in a storyteller.  But more importantly, Harris has a remarkable gift for writing deeply in and out of the characters' souls while weaving the unfolding arc of the story in a revealing way about their formative histories. It's easy to write about events, but much harder to create psycho-biography which engages and holds the reader. This is Harris' true gift. He begets utterly 'knowable' characters. One is left exhausted and sad at the end, but with a sense of not having been cheated by the effort of reading  because we know the killer so well. We even...dare I say it...understand him and why he is such a brutally disfigured personality. That's refreshing. (Did I really say refreshing?) I will look forward to 'Hannibal' and all subsequent Harris works with enthusiasm."
431,"Red Dragon (Hannibal Lecter, #1)",0525945563,Thomas Harris,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,The thing about this novel was it was by far better than the movie. But the thing is that you should really read the book before watching the movie. When i read the book after seeing the movie i was dissapointed as to how the plot moved a tad slowly and seemed to drag on. It was certainly enthralling though and a great read.
432,"I, Robot (Robot #0.1)",0553803700,Isaac Asimov,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"IMPORTANT: The book does not resemble the movie in any great detail.

432,"I, Robot (Robot #0.1)",0553803700,Isaac Asimov,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Justint,"I, Robot by Isaac Asimov is made up of a series of nine science fiction short stories that all are connected through a robot psychologist named Dr. Susan Calvin.  The stories are told as if Susan Calvin is relaying them to a reporter, the narrator.  The first story, ¿Robbie¿ is about a young girl who has a robot friend, but her mother disapproves of the relationship.  Her mother tries desperately to keep them away from each other.  In the next few stories, we are told of two scientists who are distraught with problems in development of labor robots.  The two come across danger while trying to relieve the issues almost costing them their lives in the process.  A common thread among each story is the Three Law of Robotics, which underlines and governs the way robots should behave as well as the interaction of humans and robots.  In the next five stories, Susan Calvin is the main character and the stories talk about the evolution of robots.  The stories also talk about her removal from humanity.  She retreats due to a mind-reading robot that discovers her romantic feelings for a fellow colleague.  Throughout the novel the robots show intelligence and understanding which in some cases surpasses that of the humans.  Soon the humans begin to realize that the robots may have more power then they themselves have.  Their ability to deduce and analyze creates a major problem for the humans and it seems as though the robots could remove the humans.  After their creation it is evident that the increasing knowledge of the robots will be too much for the humans.  Isaac Asimov wrote a break through novel many years ahead of its time.  His creativity and shear brilliance is shown through his attention to detail and development of the story as a whole.  It is good read for anyone interested in the mind versus machine aspect of entertainment."
432,"I, Robot (Robot #0.1)",0553803700,Isaac Asimov,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"The book is pretty old, and has a few plot holes, but it's still very entertaining and makes you think a bit.    Note that while the movie claims to be based on Asimov's books, that's a big fat lie.  The movie takes two elements from these short stories: robots, and the Three Laws of Robotics.  That's it.  The inclusion of the movie picture on the cover of the new edition is a travesty.  It would be more appropriate to put the poster from Mel Gibson's 'Passion' movie on the cover of the Bible -- hey, at least they have some characters and story elements in common!"
433,"Dark Lover (Black Dagger Brotherhood, #1)",0451216954,J.R. Ward,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"Dark Lover is my first read of a vampire storyline. I couldn't put it down. I admit I had few expectations of a romance sort of novel and even less for a story about a group of vampires. I was shocked at the detailed world the author has created, and she presents unique attributes to her vampires that extend beyond those typically found in popular culture. Like, their preferences for vampire blood and not human blood! I ended up reading the entire series and loved every book. This book drew me in, and even though I found the book somewhat profane in its use of language, it didn't detract at all from the overall quality of the book. I will say that if you are bothered by graphic sex and language, this book (series) might be hard for you to read. Having said that, there is much more to this book than the sex and rough language. Overall, excellent!"
433,"Dark Lover (Black Dagger Brotherhood, #1)",0451216954,J.R. Ward,Barnes and Noble,4.5,StephanieD,"Dark Lover was my first paranormal romance. I had a LOT of reservations and I was positive there was no way vampires could in any sense of the word be sexy or romantic. In fact, my mother had read all the books and loved them. But I stuck to my case, no way was I going to like this book. Well, I can say with no shame, that J.R. Ward proved me wrong. I loved it and can't wait to read the other 5.	Dark Lover is about a woman who is about to go through her transisition and the sexy vampire who is going to help her through it. There is a lot of action as far as the Brotherhood having to protect there species. There is a lot of steamy scenes that will probably knock your socks off too. If you have any reservations about reading this book, just give the first book a try. It may change your mind."
433,"Dark Lover (Black Dagger Brotherhood, #1)",0451216954,J.R. Ward,Barnes and Noble,4.5,EverlastingWolf,"This is the best romance vampire series I have ever read and probably will ever read! 

When I read the first page, I was compelled to continue and not just because of the steamy hot guys. I was almost certain, it had to be because I was holding my breath with anticipation and tension. I think it was also because of the way they introduced Wrath. 

These series are rare because the relationships linger on the edge of a dagger. Between rough and tender. Beautiful and cruel. Love and Hate. Reminding us all, that you can still find beauty in the dark.  

I'm completely taken with this series and I will certaintly be reading them outloud to my Wrath! 

I cannot thank the author enough!

434,"Crescendo (Hush, Hush, #2)",1416989439,Becca Fitzpatrick,Barnes and Noble,4.5,EllzReadz,"My thoughts...Crescendo starts with the mysterious death of Nora's Dad, then quickly picks up where Hush, Hush leaves off.  If you have not read Hush, Hush, I recommend you read it before Crescendo. 

Some things did not change between the two books.  First, Patch is still shady.  I still have a hard time trusting him and I lost my connection with his character.  While I want to believe he has Nora's best interests at heart, his actions at times are very hard to swallow.  I want to cry into my pillow for the pain he causes her.  Secondly, the evil character of Marcie is still around causing havoc.  Actually she is ten times worse in Crescendo, if that is even possible.  Book two does offer some insight into why she is so cruel.  

Fitzpatrick does a great job of writing Nora's character in this book.  She acts her age, making reckless decisions, and speaking without thinking.  Her jealousy is written in a way I could relate to, many of us could.  Her character also shows quite a bit of growth.  She is a lot more confident and street smart.  

Crescendo fills in a lot of blanks from Hush, Hush.  These details provide a larger picture of Fitzpatrick's world.  Nora is still a magnet for trouble, which takes readers on an adventure.  Parts of the story were are scary in a way that makes you want to leave the lights on and check under the bed.  The ending of the story surprised me a bit and left me hanging.  I am eager to continue reading as Nora is already in a heap of trouble."

Since im completley against books with and kind of sexual interactions anymore than kissing. I made the mistake of going through with books worse (i mean with sexual interactions, not the plot or story) and it made me very umcomfortable. 

I had not wanted something with swearing, smoking or drinking in it either. The story itself was fine, but it still made me wish i hadn't bought it. 

If you dont want something with that stuff in it, don't get this book. If you aren't bothered by that, then but it, because it still has a good story."

436,The God of Small Things,0679457313,Arundhati Roy,Barnes and Noble,4,SandyID,"This book is skillfully written showing how difficult life can become for children and their parents when traditions and familiar things are changed forever as the influence of a great nation brings its own forms of education and traditions to bear on another great but politically weaker nation.  The needs of the young and helpless must not be overlooked and dealt with harshly and indifferently in these circumstances, as the authoress cleverly and clearly portrays."

In all honesty, this is not a light read, but its genius! Roy's syntax and diction further highlight the tradgic events of the story.  It is dazzling - I couldn't put it down!

436,The God of Small Things,0679457313,Arundhati Roy,Barnes and Noble,4,cloggiedownunder,"The God of Small Things, the first (and so far, only) novel by Indian writer, Arundhati Roy, was written between 1992 and 1996. This (semi-autobiographical) story takes place in the village of Ayemenem and the town of Kottayam, near Cochin in Kerala, and is set principally during two time periods: December 1969 and 23 years later. The main characters are Esthappen (Estha) and Rahel, seven-year-old two-egg (i.e. non-identical) twins, and their mother Ammu. Ammu falls in love with Velutha Paapen, a Paraven (Untouchable) who works for the family&rsquo;s Pickle Factory, a man the twins already list amongst their most-loved. But even in 1969, with a Communist Government, parts of India are still firmly in the grip of the Caste system. By breaking the &quot;Love Laws,&quot; or &quot;The laws that lay down who should be loved, and how. And how much&rdquo;, Ammu and the twins set in motion &ldquo;The Terror&rdquo;. The manipulations of Ammu&rsquo;s aunt, Baby Kochamma, are instrumental in bringing down The Terror, and her subsequent cruelty to Ammu and the twins will leave readers gasping. 
As well as commenting on the Caste system and Class discrimination in general, the novel examines Indian history and politics, the taboos of conventional society, and religion. But more than anything, this is a story about love and betrayal. 
The innocent observations of 7-year-olds, their interpretation of unfamiliar words and phrases, the (typically Indian) Capitalisation of Significant Words, the running together of and splitting apart of words , the phonetic spelling, all are a source of humour and delight in this novel. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an afternoon-mare&rdquo;, Estha-the-Accurate replied. &ldquo;She dreams a lot&rdquo;. Even as Estha is being molested by the Orangedrink Lemondrink man in the Abhilash Talkies, his observations (&ldquo;Not a moonbeam.&rdquo;) bring laughter. Echoes, repetitions and resonances abound. Roy is a master of the language: &ldquo;So futile. Like polishing firewood.&rdquo; Her prose is luminous. This novel is powerful, moving, tragic. Beautifully written, with wonderful word pictures.
This novel demands at least two reads: once to learn the story; a second time to appreciate the echoes and repetitions and understand what the early references mean. It deserves a third reading to fully appreciate the prose, the descriptive passages. On this, my third reading, I read parts I would swear I had not read earlier. And I had tears in my eyes very early in the novel. I loved this book when I first read it: I love it even more now. I remain hopeful that Arundhati Roy will share her considerable literary talents with her eager readers in the form of another novel."
437,The Invention of Wings,0670024783,Sue Monk Kidd,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,I find the &quot;highlighted by Oprah&quot; text to be very distracting to the reading of this book.  I would not have purchased it if I had understood that all the highlighted text would hinder my reading and enjoyment of this book.  Won't purchase books with this &quot;feature&quot; again.  How do I get a copy without the distracting highlighting?
437,The Invention of Wings,0670024783,Sue Monk Kidd,Barnes and Noble,4.2,RebeccaScaglione,"I received this book from the publisher in exchange for a fair and honest review &ndash; but OMG was I excited when I did receive it because it&rsquo;s an Oprah&rsquo;s Book pick and I read alllll of her choices!

The Invention of Wings by Sue Monk Kidd is the kind of book that makes you want to be a better person.

The newest Oprah&rsquo;s Book Club 2.0 pick is incredibly moving. The story is told in dual narrative, following Sarah Grimke and a slave named Hetty &ldquo;Handful&rdquo; Grimke in the 1800s.

Sarah is given Hetty as a gift for her eleventh birthday, and even at that young age, Sarah believes that slavery is immoral. But Sarah is caught in the Charleston upper class lifestyle and is useless in making a change. So she rebels the way she can, giving Hetty the freedom of literacy.
Sarah evolves, trying to turn into someone she wants to be: a strong, independent woman, but her dreams are pushed down by everyone, including her family.

Only when Sarah leaves the comforts of the South does she truly begin to understand the power that individual voices can have.

At the same time, Hetty changes from young, rebellious slave girl to becoming a strong, still rebellious, woman.

Both Sarah and Hetty&rsquo;s stories are mesmerizing. Hetty is such a strong, spunky character who was so much like her mother: unwilling to bow down to every need and want from the master/missus.

And then Sarah went fully against her own culture and society in order to fight for what she believed in &ndash; equality of all people, no matter the sex or race.

Sue Monk Kidd&rsquo;s The Invention of Wings is a book that makes me want to get out there and make a difference, to take a stand for a cause I truly believe it.

The Invention of Wings is inspirational. So pick up this novel and get a little inspired yourself.

What cause do you think is necessary to fight for?

Thanks for reading,

438,What Alice Forgot,0141043768,Liane Moriarty,Barnes and Noble,4.2,l_manning,"Ok, this is my first official ""must read"" of the summer. I loved this book so much! What Alice Forgot starts with Alice waking up at the gym. She passed out, and when she wakes up she does not remember the
last 10 years of her life. She discovers that rather than being extremely happy and pregnant with her first child, she instead has 3 children and is going through a rather nasty divorce. As she tries to get her memory back, Alice also tries to piece together what has happened to her life. Where did it all go wrong?

One thing I found so fascinating was this concept of how our past selves would view our current lives. I wonder how me 10 years ago would view my life now. It's certainly different than I thought it would be, but I'd like to think that I'd be pleased with it. Alice was not. Everything was so different than how she thought it would be. She had become a completely different person, and her younger self wasn't so sure she liked the current Alice. It also became apparent that all those things that seem so deadly important as we go through our everyday lives aren't always so massive when viewed with a different perspective.

There were two other plot parts that were fascinating. One dealt with Alice's honorary grandmother Frannie. She was still dealing with things that happened in her past, and through a series of letters we see her thoughts and ideas. Frannie was fantastic! The other plot point involved Alice's sister Elisabeth, who was dealing with unexplained infertility. That part was heartbreaking at times. I think it was very realistic though. All the other characters were interesting too. Sure, they had their flaws, but in the end they were mostly good people just living normal lives.

I found myself really thinking about how much we gradually change over time. Thinking about if my decisions now will still make for a happy life in 10 years. I know it's impossible to really know, but I did find myself reviewing how I treat my family to ensure that they would still be happy in 10 years. This book is probably an example of ""chick lit"" at it's finest. It's fun and light-hearted, but it does make you think about things. Or maybe that's just me. Some people may think the ending was wrapped up too prettily, but I think it was absolutely perfect. If you're looking for a fun read with a bit of substance, then What Alice Forgot is a great choice.

438,What Alice Forgot,0141043768,Liane Moriarty,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Cecita,"I was absorbed in it from the first page. As a newly wed myself, I have to say it felt so real and scary! I particularly liked how it gave you a few clues, little by little, of what had happened. Loved the ending. Agree with some reviewers about the letters. I skipped the Grandma ones but liked the sister's ones."
439,A Brief History of Time,0553380168,"Stephen Hawking, Cao Chi, Ph???m V??n Thi???u",Barnes and Noble,4.3,ReadingRedHead,"When I started reading this book, I thought there is no way in the world I will be able to understand one of the greatest minds in physics today. How wrong I was! Dr. Hawking makes complicated theory understandable for the rest of us. This is a fascinating book that I would recommend to everyone."
439,A Brief History of Time,0553380168,"Stephen Hawking, Cao Chi, Ph???m V??n Thi???u",Barnes and Noble,4.3,CodyHunt,"Throughout his book, Stephen Hawking presents his outstanding observations and beliefs of the physics of our universe. Hawking presents information on the history of the universe, motion of the universe and most exhilarating of all, black holes. He includes his perception and opinions of the universe and its past as well as the physics acting upon it as time passes He presents the writing in reasonable short chapters that help you understand him and all of his reasoning as well as the tons of background information that he has researched and drawn his observations from. I would recommend this as a read for anyone that has even a slight interest in astronomy and the cosmos. Stephen Hawking teaches you about simple and general astronomy and from that draws major theories that are constantly changing as we learn more about our universe through technological innovations. There are many pages that will have to be read multiple times before you can really understand what he is even talking about. This isn't really a book that you can skim through or you are bound to miss something vital to the theory of relativity or some function of  quantum physics. Since it is so thorough, unlike some books, you WILL put it down. Chances are, you'll throw it down in frustration with Hawking, but you will be rewarded in the end when you realize how blatantly he put some of the most complex thoughts and information accessible to humans. I enjoyed Hawkings sense of humor and voice in his writing. Before I read this book, physics seemed extremely dry and boring but he adds humor and feeling and made me captivated by concepts. I felt like I was sitting in a classroom while I read this, hearing the teachers voice rambling on and on and on about something I didn't really care about until he cracked a joke that I just caught through the blur of boredom. I let out a little chuckle and grin then realize that the subject is exhilarating and fun. I had no dislike from this book, just shock and awe of a new subject that I knew very little about. Irate this book overall, four stars out five because I do not think this book is for everyone, but I loved it and believe that many people could capture some of the ideas in the writing and be surprised with an epiphany of your surroundings and how miniscule we are in the universe and how much else is out there in time and space."

440,"Fall of Giants (The Century Trilogy, #1)",0525951652,Ken Follett,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Catbluize,"This is the first book of a new series.  Starts with Welsh miners in early 20th century and intermission (ends) in the 1920's.  The interaction historically is wonderful, the characters are extremely varied and it's amazing how they tie together.  Follett goes into great detail of the characters.  The book is very instructional on the politics of the era and the various characters are examples of the points of view of the period and how the politics eventually affect them.

This is not a book you can read 5 pages at a time.  Chapters are 50 pages.  Find a comfortable chair, a good bottle of wine, and plan on a weekend of wonderful reading.  If you're a part of a book club, plan on chapter discussions, they will be extremely stimulating.

IF I had a complaint, it's that the book jumps between the characters.  I plan on reading the book a second time, a character at a time.

A definite for your Library.  You'll want to keep a copy to reread when the second comes out."
440,"Fall of Giants (The Century Trilogy, #1)",0525951652,Ken Follett,Barnes and Noble,3.6,SanvenFW,"Having had the opportunity to actually read the book, I can tell you that Mr. Follett is spot on yet again. His razor sharp story telling, character development and interwoven storyline are all realized brilliantly. The entanglement of these characters with each other leads to a complex yet seamless journey around the globe. The book is fast paced, almost impossible to put down and sure to be an instant classic! I can not more highly suggest a title, this one was incredible. That being said, while I agree that the eBook price is outrageous, please note that the price is not set by Mr. Follet, it is in fact, set by his publisher. While I can say this book blew me away, I'm do not think I would purchase this title until Penguin decides to stop punishing those of us who have decided to invest in the future of electronic publishing. Book: 5 stars, ebook price: 0 stars."
440,"Fall of Giants (The Century Trilogy, #1)",0525951652,Ken Follett,Barnes and Noble,3.6,PiratesGold,"To all who have complained about the price of this novel, I will be the first to admit, it is worth every dollar. Fall of Giants falls into the status level of 'Gone with the Wind.' I would have paid $40 to have the experience of reading Margaret Mitchell's timeless classic. Price is relative to all and all will have their different thresholds. I spent twenty dollars to have a fascinating journey into the early 20th century. The same day, I spent twenty dollars on cleaning supplies for my kitchen. Guess which will have the most lasting impact on my life? This is an exceptional story with Follett creating depth into his characters in which very few authors can achieve. The list of characters in the beginning of the novel can be daunting but Follett introduces his characters to the reader as if they were part of your family. You understand their thought process and inner workings to the point where emotions are evoked, similar to the way family members evoke certain emotions at Thanksgiving... for better or worse. This historical fiction has the abilty to open eyes to the complicated yet simplistic world of politics. Find a weekend with no commitments then buy this novel, a bathtub shelf, bubble bath, and a bottle of wine. On Monday, tell me what the price is to your mind and soul, of having the opportunity to enjoy the luxuries of a warm bath with an amazing novel."
441,Under the Dome,1439148503,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4,Freekman993,"Please hold your critiques until you've read the book.  I had the privilege to get my hands on an advance copy and I've been singing this story's praises to everyone.  King brings the town of Chester's Mills to vivid life, examining the deepest, darkest secrets of the town.  Early on, a character makes a reference to Golding's Lord of the Flies; if only they had such luck.  The story could happen in any town, and that is what makes it so terrifying and engaging.  Under the Dome is long, but it seems he could have  doubled the length and still left you wanting more.  I recommend taking off a few days after the release of this book, because you will not want to waste time eating, bathing, or going to work until you've turned the final page."
441,Under the Dome,1439148503,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4,Encharion,"I'll be honest.  I haven't been a fan of King's last couple of novels.  With the exception of, ""Just After Sunset"". His books have been slow at best.

This is not true with ""Under The Dome""  I too got the chance to read the advance copy and I loved every page of this lavish tome.  The wealth of characters and plot balance perfectly between way too many people to keep track of and too few to hold your attention.  Those of you skeptics who look at the page size and think of how long winded King can be, this is not that book.  It needs to be this size, and I will tell you right now it is worth every minute you spend with it on your lap.  
The only bad thing to say about his newest book is if you leave it sitting on your legs, they may fall asleep-but you'll be too enthralled to notice anyway."
441,Under the Dome,1439148503,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4,delcobooklover,"I was lucky enough to get my hands on an advance copy. I was initially concerned by the editorial reviews comparing this to The Stand. As a fan of the author, I have read all his works, the good, the bad, and the ugly. Arguably The Stand is King's greatest stand-alone work, Dark Tower connections not-withstanding, but this is darn close to the top. King catches you from page one, with his description of an apparently ordinary morning in The Mill, which quickly becomes extraordinary. The characters drawn in the story are compelling. He shows us a seemingly ordinary American town, whose underbelly is far darker than anyone can imagine. After the dome falls, the dark core of this town quickly overwhelms the good. Some of the characters are twisted and evil. The good folks of The Mill shine through the breakdown of values and social structure. But just as compelling is the effects on the dome on the normal townsfolk. People who are just like the rest of us, but fall in line with the despot in charge. In a week, a Maine town becomes Germany in the 1930's. There are some 3rd act problems in the book, it is not perfect, but it is an exceptional work. The fantastic aspects of the dome aside, this is a great book dealing with the sociology of human goups in a crisis. Like The Stand, you'll grow to love and hate the characters, but you will keep reading. King is truly a master of character developement. I forced myself to read the book in small portions, because King can turn me into a glutton, devouring his work in hours. It is worth the time to enjoy his writing to its fullest. Can't wait to see the cover!"
442,Snow Crash,0553380958,Neal Stephenson,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"""Snow Crash"" rocks.  What else can you say about a book published in 1992 featuring a heroic protagonist named Hiro Protagonist that incorporated pizza delivery franchises, ninjas, punk rock, linguistics, skateboarding, avatars, mafiosi, glass knives, and gated communities ... and managed to be prescient and coherent without being absurd?  I've read thousands of books, and have never found one more engaging than this."
442,Snow Crash,0553380958,Neal Stephenson,Barnes and Noble,4.4,DearReader,"Stephenson wrote this book in the late 80's / very early 90's. If you read the book (which is a really great read even if it were written recently) with that in mind, it will give you an extra appreciation for the feats of imagination contained within. The ""internets"" as our fearless leader would call it was certainly in existence at that time, but people, it was accessed via character based, pre-Windows, menu driven applications! 

The story starts with a sci-fi futuristic bang but builds into a really compelling drama/mystery that just gets more and more interesting while introducing one great futuristic notion after another. Eventually he ends up dealing with the origin of human language, the Bible, the Mafia, corporate America, skater culture...but it's not all over the place. It's brilliant. 

I've given this book to at least 10 people, and every last one of them loved it. A slam dunk any time but especially for holiday/summer/travel reading."

There was in fact a lot of drama but not so much to a point where it was overwhelming just to read it. Annabelle Annabelle Annabelle Greene (a joke) a model, actress, with a perfect life...on the outside. At home she struggles with her sister's eating disorder, at school drama with a girl (ex-friend) who thinks Annabelle slept with her boyfriend, as well as the (ex-BFF) other girl who all over the summer and for most of the semester Annabelle thinks hates her.Juggling all this plus a new friendship with Owen Armstrong the mysterious boy who always has his headphones on.

As always, she did a fabulous job portraying popular teens vs. the outcasts, and how it only takes on little misunderstanding to find yourself on the other side of the fence. With the character of Owen, she shows that you (no pun intended) cannot judge a book by it's cover (or a teen by their clothes or attitude).  There are many layers to people and Ms. Dessen showed each and every one in the amazing story."

445,Before I Go to Sleep,0062060554,S.J. Watson,Barnes and Noble,3.9,OtotheD,"Every morning when she wakes up, Christine has no memory of who she is, where she is, or who the strange man lying next to her is. She has amnesia, and is unable to form new memories, or retain her old ones. Some mornings she wakes up thinking she is in her twenties, others she believes she is a child. Most mornings she tip-toes to the restroom, and is surprised to find a middle-aged woman staring back at her from the mirror. It is there she finds pictures of herself and others taped to the wall. The pictures have names and identities below them. All left to remind her of who she is.

Christine lives with her husband Ben who, every day, has to tell her that she lost her memory after her accident 20-some-odd years ago. One day Christine receives a phone call from a neuropsychologist who tells her he has been working with her to help her retrive her memory. He gives her a journal that she has been keeping and on the very first page the words ""DON'T TRUST BEN!"" are written in her own handwriting.

This book is a psychological thriller that will have you turning the pages well after bedtime. It is obvious in the first few pages that something isn't quite right. Should she, or shouldn't she trust her husband? A majority of the book is Christine's Journal and to say anymore would give away the details, and I don't like to give spoilers. Though it does feel the author tends to spend a little too much time drawing things out, the ending packs such a punch that it's easily forgiven.

445,Before I Go to Sleep,0062060554,S.J. Watson,Barnes and Noble,3.9,theReader278,I loved reading this wonderful book! It has a story that keeps you entertained for hours. Truly excellent!!
445,Before I Go to Sleep,0062060554,S.J. Watson,Barnes and Noble,3.9,-Madison-,"""Before I Go to Sleep"" is a brilliant and profound piece of fiction, a psychological thriller that will captivate the reader about a traumatic brain injury that when the main protagonist wakes up she can't remember anything about herself. I can't imagine too many things as frightening as that! The premise was different from anything I've read before. This is a remarkable job of taking us through Christine's mind as she learns about events and people in her past and the frustrations involved in not being able to remember. She keeps a journal, at the suggestion of Dr. Nash; the idea being that she progressively remembers her life before the accident that caused her amnesia. The first part of the book tells about her meeting her husband and her psychiatrist calling her, telling her that she needs to read the journal she has been keeping. He gives it to her and tells her to contact him if she wants to continue her treatment. What a pulse-pounding thriller! It's suspenseful throughout and the pacing is brilliant. The thriller ending is not predictable so don't bother. Profound and completely captivating, yes, but the intrigue will keep your eyes glued.

You really capture the essence of Watson and Holmes.  The story starts off very intriguing with a mysterious murder and the chase of the killer.  However, there is a LONG intermission during the chase to give the back story of the killer and victims.  The back story proves useful once the case is resolved but I found it a little too long and wanted to get back to Baker Street.  As one of the classics it is a must read and a good start to the rest of the novels."

The depth of detail and his writing style provide a vivid mental image. I can read his books and it's like a watching a movie in my head.

In the year he took off and the time it has taken him to write this book he has grown so much as a writer.

The story begins with Eragon going off with his cousin Roran, to help rescue Roran's beloved, Katrina, from King Galbatorix's clutches. The story has many twists and turns when Eragon and Saphira are once again faced with opponents more powerful then themselves. The reader finally gets to know about Aya's friend/lover and the events that occurred just before Eragon found her.There will be a Major death, A BIG secret, the rise of a new dwarf King, the secret about a dragons power and the reader will get to know Eragon character and struggles like never before. With the Varden taking over city by city Galbatorix is not taking a blind eye to their presence anymore.This book is a MUST read for anyone who has read the previous Eragon books."
448,The Purpose Driven Life: What on Earth Am I Here for?,0310276993,Rick Warren,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"When I first read The Purpose Driven Life, I was a born-again Christian. I don't like tags but that is the best description I can give. I had attended church most of my life but drifted away. In my mid-40s, I began searching. I felt empty. When a friend recommended Warren's book, I read it, following the 40-day journey plan. I have recommended and bought copies for people. It is not the Bible but it helped me to understand many things not only about God but myself and my relationship with Him. Some may not find it enlightening but I believe that if you read it with an open mind, you will learn more about God and your relationship with Him. The book is easy to follow. I have gone through it four times. Each time I read it, I find something new to think about."
448,The Purpose Driven Life: What on Earth Am I Here for?,0310276993,Rick Warren,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"I read A Purpose Driven Life by Rev. Rick Warren two years ago. I came away frustrated because after nine months of struggling with the forty day program, I still didn't feel I had a purpose in life. The fault didn't lie in Rev. Warren's book; it was in my thought process.I thought the book was all about finding the perfect job. I hoped God would speak when I opened the book (like one of those musical Hallmark cards) and that He would name my perfect career. Not so. Practically speaking, career assesment tests do a much better job. God kept pretty quiet as to whether I would make a better secretary or bellhop.What I did find after reading The Purpose Driven Life was a deeper relationship with God. This relationship opened the door to understanding (eventually) what my life purpose is. I finally realized that my life's purpose is unique to me. It's not a job, per se, but a calling to do God's will.When I discerned my purpose, mission, calling - I realized that as long as I centered my work in God's will then it didn't matter if I was a cabdriver, a barista at Starbucks, a grade school librarian, or a life coach. I can (and should) serve God in my unique way at work, at home, no matter where I am."
448,The Purpose Driven Life: What on Earth Am I Here for?,0310276993,Rick Warren,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"Rick Warren's, 'A Purpose Driven Life,' will certainly make you ponder and reflect on the life you're leading. From the very beginning of the book, I found myself drawn into his beliefs. People often question, 'What in the world are we on this Earth for?' or 'What is our purpose?' 'Does life make sense?' Of course, no one alive knows the true answer. It is in our own belief system. Some criticize his views. However, he has a right to his own belief system. I found myself connecting with him from page one. Having gone through medical adversities in life within my family, I understand what he is trying to convey to the reader. When bad things happen to people they ask the question, 'WHY ME, WHY NOW? However, WHY NOT ME? My belief system is that God does have a master plan that we will never understand. Many people do believe that we are here for a purpose and everything happens for a reason.     I've had that experience many times in my life. The right person will enter my life to help me or a family member through a difficult adversity. Or a book will show up on the store bookshelf that will suggest the perfect solution to my problem. I believe that certain things 'good and bad' happen for a reason. Otherwise, this unpredictable world wouldn't make sense. Since I have experienced adversity 'as we all have', and have found some joy out of the difficult situations in life, I agree with Rick Warren about God's plan for us.     It gives me solace and peace knowing that God does have a plan for our lives. People think they can escape adversity. But no where in the Bible does it say that life will be all sunshine. There will surely be rainy days. It reinforced my own belief system and I highly recommend this book just to wake people up to let them know that life has meaning. We are here for a purpose. Let us not forget what our purpose is in this life.If we all acted with more compassion and acceptance, our world would be a much better place to live in.     Nancy A.

As the new leader of the Dark Daughters, she's responsible for turning it into a respectable and admirable club. Also, she seems to find herself with two boyfriends...with another guy sending her some mixed signals. On top of all of that, Zoey has been seeing some dark and mysterious creatures on the east wall.

Zoey will have to start facing the facts, especially after a shocking death in their midst reveals that what she has seen is no figment of her imagination...and what's truly horrifying is the identity of the person behind it all.Betrayed picks up on all the suspense and thrill right where Marked left off.

Mr. Butcher has created an excellent character in Harry Dresden, who, while being in unrealistic situations, seems to have realistic reactions (for a hero, that is).  I cannot recommend this book enough to fans of fantasy and mystery, as well as the other following books in the series."

I myself have a very difficult time getting actively engaged in books. I buy many books hoping to get captured by one of them so that I will not want to put the book down.  This book has done it!  I didn't know anything about the Dresden Files Series until the twelfth book already came out.  I read reviews on that one and it sparked some curiosity into purchasing the first book.  After reading the first few chapters, I was hooked!

The thing I love most about this book is how laid back and down to earth the main character(Harry Dresden) is.  I also enjoy finding out what this paranormal investigator will get his hands into.  Another great thing I enjoy about the book is that it takes place in Illinois, and the author provides very great detail in the surroundings in an actual location which people could picture in there own heads.

This is a great read, and I highly recommend this book!  I can't wait to purchase the next books in the series!"

This book is fantasy for myth and folklore enthusiasts - it's real old-world style, with a powerful grounding in cultural heritage.  It has a real pre-Tolkien feel to its mythology.

I can rarely pick up a new book in this series and not read it from start to finish in a single sitting."
451,Northanger Abbey,1593082649,"Jane Austen, Alfred MacAdam",Barnes and Noble,4,Anne_Scarlett,"I have been a big Jane Austen fan since I first read Pride and Prejudice as a ten year old. Since then, my love has only grown. I thought that nothing could top Pride and Prejudice, then I read Northanger Abbey. I love this book! It is funny, sweet, has good morals, endearing characters, and everything else that a good novel needs. I would recommend this to anyone who loved Pride and Prejudice or wished that Persuasion had a bit more spice. It is perfectly lovely, and a piece of work worthy of recognition. Put this in your personal library and read it again and again!"
451,Northanger Abbey,1593082649,"Jane Austen, Alfred MacAdam",Barnes and Noble,4,peppered_piper,"What seasoned Austen readers know is that Northanger Abbey is written almost entirely in a satirical vein. It is one of Jane Austen's finest displays of wit throughout her writing, poking fun at gothic novels and embellishing with zest. Readers who are only familiar with a few of Austen's works, like the more mainstream Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility, may thus be confused by difference in tone of Austen's first novel. It is a splendid way to familiarize oneself with all of Austen's work. Five stars."
451,Northanger Abbey,1593082649,"Jane Austen, Alfred MacAdam",Barnes and Noble,4,Laura-Samuelson,"Very hard to read. Lots of extra, odd letters and punctuation thrown in. I can't figure out how they got it so wrong. I finally gave up on reading it."

Epic, beautiful, terrifying , dark and hopeful all at once.  I can't wait for the next one."
452,"The 5th Wave (The 5th Wave, #1)",0399162410,Rick Yancey,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"An epic story of trust and human survival in the wake of an alien invasion, The 5th Wave is a well written teen fantasy novel that is a page turner.  Cassie Sullivan is a strong female lead that is thrust into a deadly new world on her own.  She's seen her fair share of death and has some serious trust issues.  Not very heavy on the actual sci-fi stuff, but that doesn't matter.  Teens will be talking about this one this summer."
452,"The 5th Wave (The 5th Wave, #1)",0399162410,Rick Yancey,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"The story is interesting enough, I guess. It's funny: it's marketed as being like Ender's Game, The Hunger Games, and The Road, but it feels more like the author <i>wanted</i>
 to make it like those, so he sloppily threw together a girl wandering the wasteland here, a camp for child soldiers there. When the quasi-Twilight love triangle started to develop, I almost threw the book down entirely. On the other hand, it's fairly entertaining at times and a pretty easy read, and I think my disappointment was augmented by all of the hype and advance marketing the book got. 

I don't know what it is about teen books that they all start to feel the same, like they're written by the same mediocre, seventeen-year-old. Sometimes I wonder if &quot;Teen&quot; is just what publishers call books they've  already committed to publishing that aren't good enough for the adult fiction section and happen to be about people under 20. I would just lower my bar for teen books, except that I've read great books geared towards young adults, and it would be a disservice to those authors to call this one-eyed man King. 

If you're big into the Teen Adventure scene, or a fan of  Rick Yancey, by no means am I trying to dissuade you from reading. If you're a reader who likes to read a little of everything and got caught up in the hype for this book, just don't expect to have your mind blown."
453,Cold Mountain,0802142842,Charles Frazier,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"I literally could not put this book down once I started reading it. With the turn of each page, I found myself becoming an even more curious and eager companion on Inman's journey. The unspoken connection between Inman and Ada is one most people can only long for. Ada's transformation is equally inspiring. Never before have I so highly recommended a book to friends, and never before have I recommended a book to strangers."
453,Cold Mountain,0802142842,Charles Frazier,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"There is a depth and richness to Mr. Frazier's reading of his book which makes the unabridged audio version superior to the printed one. At 449 pages, and with many long passages about the characters' thoughts, emotions, and world they inhabit, reading the book can - at times - be a stretch of one's patience.     But when you listen to the book, you are transported by Mr. Frazier's voice to a world that is deep in belief, experience, and characters whose lives become part of your own. Having listened to Garrison Keillor on NPR's 'A Prairie Home Companion' for many years, I cannot help but make an overwhelmingly positive comparison when reflecting on Mr. Frazier's ability to draw you gently but unyieldingly into the triumphs and tragedies of the characters' lives as well as the spirit of the land along the Blue Ridge in the western Carolinas. Like Mr. Keilor, the author has deep roots in the territory that he describes, and there is simply no substitute for the kind of familiarity found in writers who draw well on their native surroundings.      Note #1:  Get the unabridged version of the tapes. Don't sell yourself short with the abridged. You don't really gain anything, and you'd lose a lot...      Note #2:  Women read a lot more books than men for a variety of explainable and unexplainable reasons and this book has the many elements guaranteed to attract the female audience. But I want to say this is a bonafide winner for men also, especially since the tape can become part of commuting to work. As a man, I am always wary of the way authors of historical novels can transform characters - especially men - into Jane Austen period pieces. Saps or heroes or whatever. Not true with this one. Mr. Frazier tells it straight on. It is a novel to be respected.    Note #3:  Although it is set during the Civil War, the major military events are distant and described in tragic remembrance. But the local version of the war is ever-present and intense. It's a very personal set of experiences framed by civilian life under a military rule that is mediocre, savage, and inept.     For a fine novel on a major military event of the Civil War, listen to the tape version of 'The Killer Angels', a profile of the key decision-makers (both large and small) at Gettysburg."
453,Cold Mountain,0802142842,Charles Frazier,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"I have written a review about this book when I first read it and I must say it really is a wonderful fiction piece. I read this novel during the junior year of highschool, and now as a Graduate Student who has a more in-depth understanding on literary works, this books still continues to hold up and remains in my top-3 books of all time. Although some casual readers may be turned off by the length of it, I suggest stick with it and you will not be disappointed."
454,If You Give a Mouse a Cookie,0060245867,"Laura Joffe Numeroff, Felicia Bond",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Steventas,"You will read it in the living room.  

If you read it in the living room, you will probably read it in the dining room.  

If you read it in the dining room, you will probably read it at nap time.  

And if you read it at naptime, you will probably read it at bed time.  

And chances are, if you read it at bed time, you will read it a second time. :)

Our three year old great-niece LOVES this book and the ""If you give a cat a cupcake"" book.  She pretty much picks one of the two a few times each week for us to read to her at nap and bedtime.  The pictures are great, and allow us to go ""outside"" the story and look for items, and when he is drawing - colors of crayons and counting things in the pictures and other learning activities while reading the book.  Other than that and the educational value of learning that choices come with consquences, this doesn't have much ""educational"" value - it isn't a counting book or have a deep moral story.  But, it is a very beautiful book and when our great-niece outgrows it, it will go on my art book shelf.

So, if you buy this book, chances are you will enjoy it and the little one you buy it for will also enjoy it - again, and again.

454,If You Give a Mouse a Cookie,0060245867,"Laura Joffe Numeroff, Felicia Bond",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"I bought this book after referring to it at work and realizing that none of my co-workers had read it.  As this was a classic from my childhood, I was a bit flabbergasted.  I shared it with them, and now have it sitting on my desk as a reminder of thinking through a scenario from end-to-end.  I'm in the software industry, and it's a simple but effective illustration of the fact that it's not just enough to give your customers a feature: you have to think about what they'll do with it when they get it.  The lessons in the book are ones adults need to be reminded of too, not just ones for kids."
454,If You Give a Mouse a Cookie,0060245867,"Laura Joffe Numeroff, Felicia Bond",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"Laura Joffe Numeroff and Felicia Bond have teamed up on several children's stories.                       Many people will tell you that this is their favorite in the series. I slightly prefer When You Give a                       Moose a Muffin, but you'll have to decide for yourself by reading them both.                         Having had two sons, I always found them most delightful when they were the most physically worn                       out. Oh, if only I had had this mouse to keep them occupied!                         The boy is sitting in his front yard eating a cookie. He spies a mouse, and gives the mouse a little                       bite.                          This is a forward mouse, though, and he asks if he might have a glass of milk to go with the cookie.                       The boy takes him inside and obliges. Then the mouse inquires about having a straw. The boy finds                       him one. Then the mouse requests a napkin. That means that he is concerned about having a milk                       mustache. So the mouse wants a mirror to check. While looking in the mirror, he notices that his                       whiskers need some trimming. He requests some nail scissors from the boy. Considerately, he then                       wants a broom to sweep up. But if you're going to sweep in one area, you might as well do many.                       While you're at it, the floors could use a good washing. That makes the mouse tired, so he needs a                       nap. The boy makes him a little bed out of a box and a tiny blanket and pillow. But the mouse                       cannot sleep without a story. Seeing the pictures, the mouse thinks what fun it would be to make                       some pictures. Paper and crayons must be obtained! After the picture is done, he must naturally                       have a pen to sign his name. Then, the boy has to get some Scotch tape so that the picture can go                       on the refrigerator. Then, of course, you get thirsty from all that activity. You get some milk from the                       refrigerator . . . and of course, it's a good idea to have a cookie. And off we go again!!                         The contrast between the increasingly exhausted looking boy, and the sprightly mouse make for                       much good humor. Also, the boy is better at getting things for the mouse than putting them away, so                       the house is soon filled with messy piles of what the mouse wanted . . . sort of mouse droppings as it                       were.                          The absurdity of a tiny mouse running a boy ragged is quite hilarious to youngsters. By reading the                       book faster and faster, you can add a note of semi-hysteria that increases the fun.                          The words are easy to follow, and closely track the illustrations. Children can easily begin to                       memorize the story, decode the words, fill in the blanks, and later begin to read aloud to you (first                       from memory, and later in reality).                          The book is beautifully illustrated in a semi-Dr. Seuss style by Felicia Bond that adds much to the                       enjoyment.                          One thing I like about the story is that it gets into how one thing can lead to another. That's one of                       the best ways to stimulate intelligence and imaginative thinking. It is also good for problem solving                       later in life. Now, where did all these mouse whisker shavings come from? What caused them?                         After you have had fun with this story as written, you might want to have a little more fun with your                       child or grandchild and occasionally change one of the words. For example, when the mouse wants                       a napkin, you might substitute 'd"
455,"Something Blue (Darcy & Rachel, #2)",0312323867,Emily Giffin,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"I picked this book up, without even looking at the flap, because I so loved Something Borrowed. I had no clue what it was about. When I began the book and realized that the same characters were in this one, I got excited. Then I promptly got un-excited when I realized that the central first-person character of this book was Darcy -- the lying, cheating, spoiled brat ""best friend"" from Something Borrowed. I was immediately concerned that this book, being told from Darcy's perspective, would taint my fondness toward the Rachel and Dex characters from the first book, and I did not want that. It's always nice to look back fondly on characters you really like and/or identify with from a book you truly enjoy. I thought that Giffin might use this book to make you feel sympathy for spoiled Darcy and shed light on why she did the things she did. But to my surprise and delight, she did not. What's more, Darcy is still the annoying, shallow character that she was in the first book. You would think that would make for an annoying read, but it does not. Giffin pulls it off somehow and keeps it intriguing. And if ever there was a story of positive character evolution, this is it. Darcy does change over time, for the better, but not at the expense of the characters you may have grown to love. The ending of this book, too, is worth noting. Few really good books have really good endings in my opinion, but this one does. The final pages of the book are poignant, poetic ... perfect. And without being fairy tale saccharinized. 
Something Blue is a fabulous story of friendship, romance, and self-discovery. It was easy for me to give it 5 stars."

After some hesitation I decided to give it a try. I have to admit I did not love Darcy right away. She was still her spoiled, selfish, and down right annoying self. I had no compassion for her! But as the book progressed and Darcy's character progressed I began to feel for her and surprisingly ROOTING for her to get her happy ending. I actually ended up loving this book 10 times more than the first and will forever be one of my all time favorites :)

Great Job Emily Griffin for doing it again!!"

457,The Historian,0751537284,Elizabeth Kostova,Barnes and Noble,3.9,J_R_M,"Although vampire stories have always intrigued people, I must confess that I'm surprised (although happily so) that this book has gotten so many good rewiews-- this in a time when fluff vampire stories like those written by Stephanie Meyer and Charlaine Harris are all the rage. It's nice to know that there are others out there who can appreciate a historically-grounded, thoroughly researched book and still be entertained by it.Although The Historian is one of my favorites, I do have a difficult time recommending it because I understand that not all people (in fact, MOST people) can't sit through more than 200 pages of anything, especially not a book that gives lengthy details of obscure eastern European history (which I found particularly interesting). If you're looking for blood, horror, and sex, this isn't the book for you!Some may consider this blasphemy, but I found Kostova's work much more engaging and fascinating than Stoker's original Dracula. I hope we don't have to wait another ten years to see another novel with her name on it!"
457,The Historian,0751537284,Elizabeth Kostova,Barnes and Noble,3.9,criswithcurls,"Throughout my journey of reading this book it consumed my thoughts night and day. It not only put a realistic spin on the ""vampire"" genre but it also put the most realistic spin on vampires themselves. While I, of course, do not believe in vampires I was conciously checking dark passageways and streets around me to make sure nothing was there when I was in the midst of reading ""The Hisorian"". The plot and details were rich and the characters, while well thought out, were somewhat lacking.But not enough to actually consider putting the book down."
457,The Historian,0751537284,Elizabeth Kostova,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Sapph0,"It took me a good 6-7 chapters for me to really get into this book from the moment I started.  After that, I had the hope that the book would continue to hold my interest throughout.  My hope failed.  The historical facts that are stated here, were incredibly fascinating to me.  However, I did not find that the author was enough of a good historical lecturer to hold my interest the way that it could have been held.  The information just seemed dull while the subject itself was extremely interesting.  The letters that were sorted throughout the story, likewise, were a nuisance at times to go through, because by this time, it all seemed to drag on and on.  It appeared as if when a part in the book that lacked interest appeared, that was when the letters were also thrown in, leaving me with the urge to close the book and not continue reading.  The ending left me dissatisfied, and were it not for the fact that I found the plot (at least) intriguing, I would have never either picked up this book, or finished it.  It left a lot to be desired by me."
458,Station Eleven,0385353308,Emily St. John Mandel,Barnes and Noble,4.1,BrandieC,"There has been a lot of &quot;buzz&quot; surrounding Emily St. John Mandel's contribution to the post-apocalyptic genre, Station Eleven, which was selected as one of Amazon's best books of the month for September. While I'm not sure that all the hype is quite justified, I did enjoy Mandel's writing and her fresh approach. Rather than placing her primary focus on the horrors and challenges of survival in a world decimated by the &quot;Georgia flu,&quot; Mandel clearly believes the motto she gives her Traveling Symphony: &quot;Survival is insufficient.&quot; The main characters in Station Eleven are not ex-military hardasses, as is so often the case in this genre; they are actors, musicians, and artists who believe that the fine arts are essential to our human identity, a sentiment with which I heartily agree. Mandel conveys this feeling not only through the actions and dialogue of her characters, but also by following key relics of the pre-apocalypse world (a paperweight, a comic book) as they pass through various hands, connecting lives in sometimes unexpected ways. We have here, not six degrees of Kevin Bacon, but six degrees of &quot;Station Eleven,&quot; the comic book from which the novel draws its title.

Strangely enough, Station Eleven's strength is also its main weakness. Mandel gives short shrift to her characters' survival narratives. Survival may be insufficient, but it is nevertheless essential. Kirsten Raymonde, the child actor who subsequently joins the Traveling Symphony in its Shakespeare productions, doesn't remember her first year as a survivor, presumably because it was too traumatic. Although I didn't need the gory details, I did feel as though her amnesia left a gaping hole as I reached the end of the book.

This quibble aside, Station Eleven is a moving and surprisingly hopeful addition to the literature of the post-apocalypse.

I received a free copy of Station Eleven through Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review."

This is a book that I will give as gifts at Christmas and birthdays just because it is written in such a way that it captivates you.  I couldn't put it down and I have reviewed quite a lot of books.

I particularly enjoyed the way Buck portrayed China, its class systems/struggles, and family cultures. When reading the story it was obvious Buck was very knowledgable of China and the time setting in which the story occurred. Although there were many times I had a strong dislike of the main character there were times when the reader could not help but be impressed with his resolve. The saddest moments in the book involved those dealings with his wife. We should all be very thankful not to be a laboror's wife in revolutionary China.

It's not that he's original... he borrows a lot ideas from Walter Benjamin and Claude Levi-Strauss, but that he explains it in clear, easy language, with examples.The chapter about oil painting was especially illuminating for me, as I had never understood how to tell a ""great"" oil painting from a mediocre one, having no context in which to see them.  But Berger here really dissects the historical origins of the form, and what oil really allowed artists to do that they weren't able to do before.Major turn off: the entire book is set in bold type.  I have no idea why this decision was made, but the book is worth reading, despite this huge flaw.  Another smaller flaw: a book about images should definitely have been printed in color."
463,"Dragonfly in Amber (Outlander, #2)",0385335970,Diana Gabaldon,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"Dragonfly in Amber is a really good second chapter of the Outlander series. If you enjoyed Outlander you are sure to enjoy the continuation of Jamie and Claire's story. All of the characters from the first novel are back, with more romance and political intrigue than ever.

At nearly a thousand pages, this book is longer than Outlander, but generally the pacing is good and the action comes fast, so you keep reading. I did feel like the third quarter of the book dragged a little bit, but all in all I really enjoyed the read.

I would not recommend that a reader new to the Outlander series start with this book, since there is very little flashback to the first book, and you really need the background of the first book to understand what is going on in Dragonfly.

For the most part, I recommend books that don't need prior books for the background check, but this was an exception."
463,"Dragonfly in Amber (Outlander, #2)",0385335970,Diana Gabaldon,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"It's the great authors like Daina that keep me coming back for more.   This is the second book in the Outlander series.There is so much story in this book I honestly don't know where to begin...The story starts out in 1968, Claire Randall is a doctor, her husband Frank Randall passed away two years ago. She is traveling in Scotland with her daughter Brianna. Traveling back to Inverness where she disappeared into the past twenty years ago. She returns to visit an old friend and to try to find out the fate of her other husband Jamie Fraser and his clansmen, wondering if they died with so many others on the battlefield of Culloden in 1746.An engrossing read with lots of attention to detail, those of you who love details like I do will not be disappointed. I know that Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series is sometimes categorized as romance, I think that is an incredibly limiting label to place on a story that is so rich with history and adventure. Reading this I often found myself humming the theme to Indiana Jones. I loved the adventure, the treachery and the passionate love story between Claire and Jamie.Gabaldon creates very vivid descriptions and very realistic characters and a wonderfully rich story. She's a talented writer and a gifted story teller and I am looking forward to reading more in this series."
463,"Dragonfly in Amber (Outlander, #2)",0385335970,Diana Gabaldon,Barnes and Noble,4.5,ReadingQueen12-17,"I actually started this book a year ago. The fact that I am just now writing this review because I've just now finished this book is telling in and of itself. After reading Outlander and LOVING it, I set sky high expectations for the rest of the series and delved into book 2 with lightning speed. After 500 pages of this romantic onslaught (which is only the half way point), my rocket paced enthusiasm was reduced to a mere farting noise. As so often happens when I read two books by the same author back to back, the stylistic flaws become blaringly obvious and in the case of Dragonfly, Gabaldon's honeydew dialogue and purple prose proved too much for my pallet. 
To be fair, book two does pack its fair share of action, introduces a new cast of characters, and moves the landscape from the rugged highlands of Scotland to the metropolitan high life in Paris. But in spite of all this, the benefits of the story can not overcome the pitfalls of the writing. For example, after a scene where Clare and Jamie barely escape a life threatening situation by the skin of their teeth, Clare turns to Jamie and exclaims ""Oh Jamie! I just want to make love to you!"" 
What?! That doesn't even make sense! You are almost killed, you've just gotten home, it is made expressly clear that you feel like hell and you want to make love? I mean maybe ""Oh Jamie, open that whiskey I need to get drunk"" or ""Oh Jamie, let's call a therapist!"" but not ""let's make love"". That's just ridiculous. 
The other issue I have is with Gabaldon's apparent obsession with adverbs. There is not a SINGLE action that takes place without some descriptive word preceding it: ""he handsomely ran across a field"", ""she tremblingly touched his glistening chest"". OH MY GOD. 
Will I continue with the rest of the series? Yes, because I've already bought the books. Will I enjoy them? Not likely."

I found it not only depressing but even disturbing.  The relationship between the two sisters is almost pathologically masochistic, love-hate-envy-resentment to the extreme.  Not even the magic of Shirley McLaine could save this horrible plot.  These are someone shoes that definetely are too tight for me.  If you like disfunctional relationships, then you will enjoy this movie."
465,In Her Shoes,0743495667,Jennifer Weiner,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,"The first 10 mins. do have a few sex scenes but the movie considerably cools down after that.  IMHO, this movie should've gotten an ""R"" rating.      It was a great movie.  I did not expect to like it at all but I ended up loving it.  I even bought the DVD when I sent back the rental.  The movie shows the tremendous character growth of both sisters.  Maggie (played by Cameron Diaz) becomes more responsible and Rose (played by Toni Collette) becomes more free and fun.  Despite the rift that comes between them, their separation helps them become more confident and appreciate each other more.  This movie will make you laugh, think, and cry.    I was surprised by Cameron Diaz's performance.  I was used to seeing her in roles such as ""Charlie's Angels"" but she is also great in serious roles.  This role shows that she is more dynamic than she lets on."

""Finally, I can read it on my Nook"", I thought.  I was extremely disappointed in some of the choices of the formatters.  Tolkien's illustrations are included, but are reduced to a postage stamp size, for some reason.  The Nook screen has a very high resolution, and the illustrations should take advantage of it!  The illustrations even look terrible on the tiny iPhone screen.  Also, for some reason, the lines of verse are irregularly spaced.  Sometimes you'll get 5 stanzas on the screen, sometimes two or three with bizarre spacing.  If I'm paying for a product, I expect a professional look and consistent formatting!"

When it starts out with a three foot tall person being thrown out of his home with nothing, and coming back the richest person in his country, it will almost always be a great book.
  In the beginning a hobbit named Bilbo gets thrown out of his home and goes on an adventure.  The following exert is Gandalf the wizard getting Bilbo out the door. ""But. """"No time for that!"" ""But.""""No time for that either!""   He then goes on a fantastic journey with talking spiders, goblins, greedy elves, and..riddles.  That last part may not make sense, but it will when you read it and decide it is an incredible book.
  I think it is an occasionally funny, exciting, fantasy genre adventure story.  It sprinkles in humor sparingly at good points in the story.  It is not a book I would recommend for those below eleven or twelve years of age.
 The Hobbit is, in my opinion, an incredible read that should be worth a look from everyone.
 The Hobbit is the greatest book I have ever read, and a true classic.  If you like The Lord of the Rings movies, you will love this book.  When I set it down, I was captivated by its story, and its incredible quality."

Once I did, however,   I was disappointed.  I was expecting Diaz's style to be   much more subtle and sophisticated, based on what I'd   read in the reviews, and was rather underwhelmed by his   style of prose.  The characters had the potential to be very   interesting, but I think the author tried to delve too deeply   into too many of them, thus leaving the reader with a   shallow impression of all.  Oscar, especially, disappointed   me.  While he may not be a typical DR boy, he is the   standard nerdy American boy stereotype.  I almost felt as   if I was reading a random YA paperback with subpar   writing and a so-so plot.    I enjoyed the supernatural elements of the book, but they   were so few and far between, and examined so briefly,   that Diaz might as well just have left them out.  The   Spanish sentences and the footnotes didn't bother me.  If   I don't understand something, I can always find an   internet translation site, and while the footnotes did drag   a bit at times, my understanding of the book would have   been severely prohibited without them.    Overall, not a bad book by any means, but certainly not   one of my favorites.  Perhaps if my expectations hadn't   been so high to start with I would have enjoyed it more."

As an English teacher, I find some of the slang and strange sentence structure slightly off-putting, but certainly not enough to put the book down.  I find Latin American history/culture extremely fascinating, so the novel's take on the Trujillo Era is quite engaging.  I would recommend it to a friend, but it is neither light nor easy reading,so better for a book club/somewhat serious read than escapist or beach reading..."
467,The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao,1594489580,Junot D??az,Barnes and Noble,3.9,PickledJarofBrain,"Book Review: The Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao

            The Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao by Junot Diaz is definitely not an ordinary book. and not to be read lightheartedly. It is written in lively voices of the characters in mix of English and Spanish, jumping from time to time and characters to the other. It tells the story of the De Leon Family, consisting of the Single Mother, Bel&#237;cia, and her children, Lola and Oscar. Bel&#237;cia's story tells the tale of her youth, when she was so recklessly in love with men and the disaster the love brings to her. Lola's story consists of a growing woman trying to find her freedom within her rocky relationship with her mother. Oscar, the main boy, tries to find true romance with his heavy body and geeky tastes, and ends up meeting his own ""happy"" doom. A strong curse (or 'F&#250;ku', as the family calls it) seems to follow this family from 1944~1995, and the characters struggle to survive and find their destiny within it.

            The book is not particularly an easy reading, for there are so many jumps. Time jumps almost randomly every chapter, and at this change, the narrator, place, and people flips back and forth. Also, the author provides an inside-out history of the Trujillo dictatorship in Dominican Republic in side notes, which deeply related with the story base. Violence and injustice is strong in the story, and you'll be taken back by the intensity of emotions. Despite the strong themes, there are still humor and romance (although sometimes politically wrong), and draws its readers into the true read-through oh humanness

            I recommend  The Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao to those who like a story with fast pace, and a mix of fiction with reality. Also, the book contains many aspects, from violence to humor, and is good to re-read. For those who does not like so much changes in plot from chapter to chapter, this book might not be as capturing to you.

            In overall, this book opened my eyes to a new type of literature with its direct 'street' language, talking about very possible events. I strongly recommend this book to be read smoothly and through the night, and hope that you experience the excitement in it too."
468,Their Eyes Were Watching God,0061120065,Zora Neale Hurston,Barnes and Noble,4.1,rb924life,"My Review
	

This review is about a book called ""Their Eyes Were Watching God,"" by Zora Neale Hurston.  If you wanted to now the genre of this book is a Western Romance type.  If you like stories about the past in slavery time you will love this book.  This book consists of many people since the setting is in the town of Eatonville in Florida.  Main characters of the book consist of Janie, Jody Starks, and a young man by the name of Tea Cake.  Supporting characters in the story are Nanny Crawford, Johnny Taylor, Pheoby Watson and Dr. Simmons.  In more depth Janie is a really complex character in this book.  She is beautiful, very intelligent, and powerful.  Throughout this whole story she tries to find who and what she really is and fights through all of the obstacles and finds out that she is a powerful black women that doesn't need a man to support her.  Another main character in this book is young sweet talking Tea Cake who is Janie's longest lover.  Tea Cake plays a huge roll in this story.  He teaches Janie many things and plays a crucial role in her development.  He is a strong well rounded character with only great morals.  This guy is the best guy out of the other two, first husband Logan Killicks and Jody Starks her second husband.  In this story the setting is really significant because it is based in Florida a little bit after slavery has been abolished.  Because of this there are many African-Americans who are just like Janie and Tea Cake trying to find a home and where they fit in life.  The major conflict for the most part is that Janie can not stay with a man for her entire life and trying to figure out ultimately who she is.  During the course of this story she is with three different guys.  She leaves two of them and something happens to the other that I won't exactly tell what.  One thing that is very special about this book is the dialect between characters.  Throughout the whole story the characters don't speak proper english, they still have a sense of not being educated when they speak, but it sort of gives the book a good aspect and makes it more realistic.  In this book there is a lot of conversations and dialect it's the majority of the book.  You don't tend to get inside to the thoughts of characters.  The point of view in this book is first person told from Janie's views.  I'm a high school baseball player type of guy and I really honestly could say that I was pretty interested in this book.  Even though it wouldn't be a book I regularly read.  It took me for a ride through the life of Janie from childhood growing up to her late forties.  There were thrills and excitement to starting a new town of only colored folks to disappointment and tragedy at the end of the book.  All in all it was a thumbs up.  A great read!!!!!"
468,Their Eyes Were Watching God,0061120065,Zora Neale Hurston,Barnes and Noble,4.1,FayBellamyPowell,"I first read ""Their Eyes Were Watching God"" more than 45 years ago and thought it was a magnificent piece of writing.  In August of 2008 I  bought the book on CD, read by Ruby Dee, and I must tell you, I was overwhelmed. Ruby makes the characters in this book live.  If there was such a thing as Oscars for individuals reading books on tape/CD etc., Ruby would win it, hands down.  Her presentation breathes life into each and every character; their voices, male and female, through her interpretation, is absolutely outstanding.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to go on an adventure, because Zora Neale Hurston's main characters were living a life of adventure, of being nomads in America, of taking a chance on life, of walking out on faith.  Amd Ruby Dee, through her vocalization, includes you in that adventure. Absolutely wonderful book and Rudy Dee's reading is like icing on the cake.  Just amazing."
468,Their Eyes Were Watching God,0061120065,Zora Neale Hurston,Barnes and Noble,4.1,KATiEJB,"""Their Eyes Were Watching God"" tells the story of a young black womans life. Throughout the book, she encounters many new and unpredictable obstacles that, in the end, she learns made her into a better person and more appreciative of her own life. Through three marriages, Janie learns how beautiful, though sometimes brutal, the world can be. She travels from place to place, seemingly always looking for something better, she wasn't going to settle for just anything. Janie wins the heart of any reader because of her determinaton and strong will."

This is the second novel of hers I read, and I have to say, I liked it even more than Pride and Prejudice (which was awesome!). Fanny's sweet character and manners touched me, and to meet all of the characters and travel along with them in time is a very touching experience, which makes you miss them when you've finished the book, as if you'd let go of old friends.

It touches on his experience through a concentration camp and describes a great deal into logotherapy...or finding one's reason to live.  In a time when it seems all of our immediate needs are met, i too, feel a sense of hopelessness or meaningless as i am unemployed with a mountain of student loan debt.

Since that time it had languished on my bookshelf, overcome by other priorities. After all, it was written in 1959, so it could wait a bit longer, right? Having just finished this book I really wish I would have made the time earlier. The lessons within could have easily been applied earlier and with great results. This book is simply remarkable. At 165 pages, ""Man's Search For Meaning"" is lightweight compared to some of my other reads, but this book took me some time to read, not because the subject matter was difficult, but because it really caused me to stop and reflect many a time. Great things really do come in small packages - less is more. ""Man's Search For Meaning"" is a life changing book that you simply cannot afford to pass up."
473,"In the Woods (Dublin Murder Squad, #1)",0670038601,Tana French,Barnes and Noble,3.6,SkatesNYC,"I have to agree with many reviews posted.  The book was overly descriptive about irrelevant details, whereas one of the biggest mysteries was never resolved (perhaps a sequel).  The back story was just a red herring for the main event it seems, and was poorly intertwined.  The fact that the ending wasn't a ""happy"" one made for an interesting read.  I found myself liking the main character all the way through until the end, where the arguments between him and the female main character were borderline ridiculous.  Could have been written better.  All in all, interesting concept, and may be next time, less time should be spend on description of nature as oppossed to actually addressing the story.  I can usually get through such a book in 2 days, this took nearly a month."

Then the investigation pretty much goes nowhere, or in circles.  There is an old mystery and a new one and both seem to be related.  The old, and more intersting one, is never really solved.  The new one is solved almost like an aside.  I came to dislike the self-centered, whining protagonist and felt badly for his partners.  I would not recommend this book as a good read."

474,The God Delusion,0618680004,Richard Dawkins,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"I am amazed at some of the negative reviews of this book and am doubtful that some of these reviewers actually read the book.  I found The God Delusion to be a well-assembled and witty argument against faith.  For the reviewers that throw scriptures at him as rebuttal, you might as well threaten him with unicorn attacks, as they hold as much weight--none!  This book will not convince those blinded by faith to open their eyes but it reinforces the convictions of those that still hold onto reason.  Richard Dawkins does a great job of showing how faith requires the believer to suspend their reason.  The fact that so many are willing to do this is troubling and downright scary.  I particularly enjoyed his dismantling of the 'uncaused first cause' argument.  I was raised as a Catholic and always asked 'Who created God?'  I never did get a satisfactory answer, only 'God always existed.'  Well, the fact that the universe always existed is more likely because it doesn't rely on some 'bearded sky daddy' that hears your thoughts and answers your prayers, just physics we don't yet understand. Too many of us have been brainwashed as children to believe in fairy tales. Thankfully, some of us recover the reason needed to see how foolish we were.  I have read most of the books that the negative reviewers recommend and would put Dawkin's book against all of them.  Logic always wins over blind faith!"
474,The God Delusion,0618680004,Richard Dawkins,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"I found this book very refreshing, and a great read. Although it may be considered condescending at times, he gets his point heard in an intelligent and even humorous way. As a born and raised atheist I did not need anymore convincing, but I definitely enjoyed the read. Anyone bashing this book because of their own personal beliefs should really just step back and take another look. If you don't agree with it, read it again. Maybe you'll catch it this time around. A great read for all open-minded intellectuals."

475,"Where She Went (If I Stay, #2)",0525422943,Gayle Forman,Barnes and Noble,4.5,BooksWithBite,"I cried. My heart broke and came back together again. I loved reading every single word of this book. There is so much emotions and unspoken regrets that punches you in the stomach.  The story is captivating from the very beginning, never letting you go. 
 
Adam and Mia are both great characters with much  history and love. The story was great as it was being told from Adam's point of view. I loved getting inside his heart and his head. I loved watching Mia as she is now. So much has happened in the past few years that to be able to see it all come together was genius.

What else can I say that hasn't already been said? This book is simply divine all the way through. If you have not picked up this book you should. It will break you heart like no other book has before, but if will also leave you smiling.

Ms. Forman wrote an unforgettable, undeniably, perfect book. It was perfect. The writing, the plot, and both amazing characters had my eyes running with tears and a heart yearning for love.

There was some minor cursing  and a sex scene (vague)."
475,"Where She Went (If I Stay, #2)",0525422943,Gayle Forman,Barnes and Noble,4.5,A_Readers_Record,"Writing this review is even harder then writing the review for If I Stay, which took me over a month to write.

Rather then picking up directly where If I Stay left off, Where She Went picks up three years later and this time it is Adam who guides us from his spot in stardom with his band, Shooting Star.  Adam was almost unrecognizable at first but that laid the wood work for the emotional roller coaster that was this not-even-sad book.  I mean, really, how does one cry when the book isn't really that sad.  

Who knew the stepping stones for Where She Went were not only Mia's accident and Adam and Mia's mutual love for music, even if from different spectrums, but Adam's promise,
""If you stay, I'll do whatever you want. I'll quit the band; go with you to New York. But if you need me to go away, I'll do that too. .. And that would suck, but I'll do it. I can lose you like that, if I don't lose you today. I'll let you go. If you stay."" 

At the risk of sounding extremely vague Mia's character was nothing compared to the complexity of Adam's.  The weight of his voice, his emotions, and the way that one promise paved the path for what was his life, all contributed to this extremely raw and emotional read.  Even being from Adam's point-of-view, through his eyes I was still able to see the emotions of others, for as off track as Adam was painted in his story I was still able to pick through his eyes and piece together the emotions that mattered.

Gayle Forman truly is brilliant with If I Stay and now Where She Went.  She give us two books that formed one extremely moving, thorough, story.  With having had both Mia and Adam's points of views I was able to see all sides of these characters, piecing together the story of their lives and the weight of their love and how it affected them.  Gayle concluded Where She Went beautifully, as well as the story of Mia and Adam.  Even if it wasn't straight out of a fairy tale.

475,"Where She Went (If I Stay, #2)",0525422943,Gayle Forman,Barnes and Noble,4.5,theReader278,I loved reading this wonderful book! It is a story that keeps you entertained for hours.
476,The World According to Garp,0345915593,John Irving,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"This was my first John Irving book. When I first started, the book seemed a bit crowded with detail that seemed to slow the story down, but the style of the writing was not what made me a fan of the book. It was the characters that sold me.     To me, the story was about how people define themselves. What events make us who we are, and how the goals we set for ourselves help shape what we become. Garp is a writer who is always striving to create his greatest work. Ironically, the story that gains the most notoriety is the one written when he was at his most innocent in life, his first. Life can hinder the imagination because we relate life experience to our storytelling. It fashions how we see and interpret things.    Admittedly, some of these characters are extremes, but you have to appreciate the irony and humor of Jenny, a woman whose misinterpreted independence turns her into a pivotal player in the feminist movement. Each character is defined by the choices they make, the paths they lead. Although it is not the most upbeat ending I've ever read, the power of the book shows how different events have such dramatically different consequences on each person.  The roles of sexuality, greatness and political correctness, family, and marriage are all explored in very real and graphic ways. By following each character to their end (literally) you can appreciate how the cycle of life continues and how each character left their mark on those around them.     By the end of the book, you can't help but feel sorry to see this eccentric cast of characters go. A good read."
476,The World According to Garp,0345915593,John Irving,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Booklover87,"I just finished reading this novel and it has become one of my favorites.  John Irving is such a fantastic writer.  T.S. Garp and Jenny Fields are two of the greatest characters ever written and the story is original, funny, heartbreaking, sad and, at times, horrible.  I enjoyed every word.  I highly recommend this to anyone who loves novels because this is a novel written for the reader."
476,The World According to Garp,0345915593,John Irving,Barnes and Noble,4.4,ds1017,"I've been a fan of John Irving since I read ""A Widow for One Year"" several years back. I decided to visit this story as it was his most famous and I recalled it being studied in my high school, although I was not in that class. If I had to choose I would say it is the best book I've ever read. The themes of life, death, gender identity, sexism, sexuality, human neuroses, marriage and family are so deftly woven into the perfect ""dramady"" of a story, I cannot imagine any other book coming close. That you can simultaneously identify with every single character at some point in the book (even if you previously hated them, and vice versa) is only testament to the most overriding theme of all- the world and the characters in it are ever-changing with our ever-changing perspective. As Garp's world view evolves we see that what was once ridiculous is now wholly understandable, what was once noble and beautiful, is now a silly outdated sentiment. Death is the ultimate equalizer, and hence the main theme. If we are all terminal cases, we have far more in common than we realize."
477,"Killing Floor (Jack Reacher, #1)",0515141429,Lee Child,Barnes and Noble,3.9,WicDKityNes,"The first of this series that I read was Nothing To Lose,,,and ABSOLUTELY fell-flat out- in love!  And I knew right then that I would read the whole series.  Since then,  I've read about 6 of them and Killing Floor was First Rate.   All of them are Top Notch,,,hands down.  My only fear is that I'll read them all and there will be no more; will be a sad day indeed."
477,"Killing Floor (Jack Reacher, #1)",0515141429,Lee Child,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"This is my 1st Jack Reacher book and it won't be my last.  I am starting with the first one and have already picked up the next two books in the series.  This book was a roller coaster ride from the beginning.  Reacher gets off a bus and stumbles into a small town looking for information on a musician that lived there years ago. Next thing you know he is in a diner eating when the local police storm in and arrest Reacher for murder.  Child develops good characters, a great story, and plenty of twist. A mystery thriller that was hard to put down.  Reacher is bad ""a"" in this story and I can't wait t0o read about his next encounter with trouble."
477,"Killing Floor (Jack Reacher, #1)",0515141429,Lee Child,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Susan Conlan,"Having read every Reacher novel and finally beginning to get a handle on the guy after the latest, which delves into his child-of-a-military-man upbringing, and in which Reacher is ironically placed in the position of leadership in his own family, I decided to go back to the beginning and read them again, sequentially.  It is going to be fun watching Reacher grow, along with Childs' skills, and now I can appreciate the poor guy's idiocyncracies in the later stories by knowing his earlier life in the order it took place. I get a kick out of Childs' obvious affection for his character, Reacher.   It is almost as if he is raising a son, the way he explains (and makes excuses for) Reacher's unusual behavior and uncommon lifestyle.  Although I am not usually a fan of the macho or ""superhero"" persona, Childs has me returning time after time and looking for the next book.  He has made me care about his paper character like a (dare I say it)  mother!  This first book of the series is a ""must"" read for anyone intending to follow the series, in order to get a good basis for Reacher's somewhat odd lifestyle.  I appreciate Childs' imaginative and descriptive style throughout the series.  The fun begins here with this book - don't miss it."
478,Robinson Crusoe,0375757325,"Daniel Defoe, Gerald McCann, Virginia Woolf",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"Robinson Crusoe was an excellent read.  Entertaining and   eductional.  I used it as a read-aloud to my kids.  They   were a little skiddish at the graphic depiction of the   cannibalization (who could blame them), but they   thoroughly   enjoyed the book.    The introduction in the B&N Classics Series is worth a read   too.  It gives interesting insight into Defoe's life and   motivation for writing the novel.  The endnotes are   essentially nonexistent, which is too bad.  The B&N   Classics often (but not always) have very good endnotes to   better describe what the author was intending to convey.    Not in this book."
478,Robinson Crusoe,0375757325,"Daniel Defoe, Gerald McCann, Virginia Woolf",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,I loved this book and I am only 8! I read it in third grade and I wanna read it again on my NOOK now that I am 11.  THANK YOU DANIEL DEFOE for making this AWESOME book.
478,Robinson Crusoe,0375757325,"Daniel Defoe, Gerald McCann, Virginia Woolf",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Charlito,"This book is deeper than I first imagined.  I was supposed to read this in school but I never took the time to do so.  Now in my late 30's I decided to read it on my nook.  I was surprised to find that this book is more about self discovery and how Crusoe discovers where he fits into God's plan.  Key ideas involved in the book are of mastery, spirituality, & morality.  Crusoe becomes a man one can truly respect."
479,The Prince,0937832383,"Niccol?? Machiavelli, Adolph Caso, Rufus Goodwin, Benjamin Martinez",Barnes and Noble,3.3,jkepler on LibraryThing,I can see how it had a huge influence in humanistic politics--it lends itself to realpolitik.
479,The Prince,0937832383,"Niccol?? Machiavelli, Adolph Caso, Rufus Goodwin, Benjamin Martinez",Barnes and Noble,3.3,homeofharris on LibraryThing,"Everyone relates this book as explaining how to be an unethical (possibly immoral) self-centered person to attain success by back-stabbing and the like. It gives tips on how to play people against one another, etc.I must say that honestly it is really just common sense stuff. Obviously these are all undesirable traits to find in someone, and in fact I avoid people who live their lives with any resemblance to the methods in the book, but none of this is new.  Basically it is all just politics as usual.  Watch a group of how teenage girls interact with one another, ostracize a friend for a while, steal each other's boyfriends, etc.  You'll learn everything you need to know about The Prince."
479,The Prince,0937832383,"Niccol?? Machiavelli, Adolph Caso, Rufus Goodwin, Benjamin Martinez",Barnes and Noble,3.3,Kade on LibraryThing,"To many autodidacts, this book is a bible of political science, a gross misconception that reinforces the cynical view of politics perpetuated in popular culture.  This wouldn't bother me if it weren't for the fact that people read the Prince, and then think there's no other bibles to political science. The Prince is to modern political theory what Sun Tzu is to Clausewitz's Von Krieg.  It has come before, and is useful for tracing a linear path and building upon what comes before, but if you're a complete neophyte to political science and think this comes packed with all the answers, you're grossly off the mark, and your time would better be spent on John Locke's Second Treatise (which actually is a lighter read), Hobbes' Leviathan, Marx's First and Third Manuscripts, Burke's Reflections, or Rosseau's Social Contract.  Highly recommended for political scientists to see the origin of their discipline."
480,"The Amber Spyglass (His Dark Materials, #3)",0440238153,Philip Pullman,Barnes and Noble,4.4,JayInBloom,"This book is the third in the series 'His Dark Materials' by Philip Pullman. So much controversy has surrounded this book, and this is why. In 'The Amber Spyglass', Lyra and Will, the heroine and hero of the story, learn about growing up, Dust finally settling, having their daemons (spirit in animal form) find their permanent form, love, and the existence of God. now Pullman was a devout atheist when he was alive, so it shouldn't have been shocking what he said in his books about God and His angels, but many people thought it was. This book was ahead of its time, and although considered a 'children's' or 'young adults' book, it is just as easily adult literature. In his metaphorical ways, Pullman discusses the possibility of other worlds, evolution of these worlds, a young teenager's blooming sexuality, how politics AND religion can corrupt people's individual thinking, and how the interconnections between worlds,  and the organisms in them can bring not just one species or world, but everything, falling down around our heads.
One of the main issues in this book was the way God, or the 'Authority' was described, not as an all-powerful being, but simply an archangel, dying of old age, and how the hapless Lyra, and her friend Will, only being thirteen or fourteen, don't realize that by setting the Authority free of His prison, they have killed Him. You see, only the Angels and witches of Lyra's world have free access to all of the adjoining worlds in the universe, and Will carries a knife (see The Subtle Knife, Book Two of His Dark Materials) that can rip holes from one world to another. And Lyra carries an alethiometer, or a golden compass (see The Golden Compass, Book One of His Dark Materials) that can answer any question asked of it. 
After Lyra and her daemon, Pan, are kidnapped by Lyra's evil, theologian mother, Mrs. Coulter, Will and the polar bear king Iorek have to rescue her, as Lyra represents the rebirth of Eve, 'the temptress'. Also, Lyra's father, a scientist, is after her, to protect her from the Church, who believe they have to kill her, to stop the replay of the Fall from Grace described in the Book of Genesis in the Holy Bible. Will tears a whole in another world, where he and Lyra escape to, and they find themselves in the world of the dead, trying to find a way out, so the dead can be free to evaporate into the air.
The Amber Spyglass is not a book to read simply for leisure, for once you read it once, you will find yourself going back to pet its spine maybe a year afterwards, to open it to a favorite spot, and discover new meanings behind every metaphorical phrase in the book. It is a thing to mull over, and smile at your new discoveries.
One part that describes both evolution at its highest and Pullman's great ability to imagine things outside of our world, is the world in which no humans exist, but a certain Dr. Mary Malone stumbles upon, and discovers a completely, previously unheard of intelligent being, the mulefa. Their world evolved in a completely different way than out own, and theirs ties into both Mary's and Will's, and Lyra's worlds, in the way of Dust, or the beginning of the original Fall.
It may seem like a lot of information, but Pullman's writing pull you in from the first page and you are stuck until you hear Lyra's last words, 'Build the Republic of Heaven',  and the book spits you out, jumbled and ready to try and find the next in the series, but of course, as in all great endings, there is n"
480,"The Amber Spyglass (His Dark Materials, #3)",0440238153,Philip Pullman,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Ludolove,"I really enjoyed reading this series, but I thought the Amber Spyglass was not as good as the first two.  I would have liked it more if one of the main characters were the narrators of the book. I felt like I needed a deeper understanding of their emotions, or something that gave the characters a greater depth.  All and all, I still would definitely still recommend this series to all the fantasy lovers out there.  This story has fantastical worlds and imaginative characters."
480,"The Amber Spyglass (His Dark Materials, #3)",0440238153,Philip Pullman,Barnes and Noble,4.4,A-Wood,"Is a very good ending to a very good sci-fi trilogy. Can definitely see his anti-religion and anti-God points of view very well in it. If that bothers you then stay away, but if you like science fiction and are looking for a good series to read then try this out."
481,"Wizard's First Rule (Sword of Truth, #1)",0765346524,Terry Goodkind,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Ravenclaww,"That is if they don't read this novel. I must admit that I first got into this because of the show Legend of the Seeker. Which got me hooked on from the very first second of the opening. As the show progressed I found out that it was based on novels and I quickly searched for them and added them to my list of books to buy. I finally bought all of the books and finished Wizard's First Rule and Holy Mother Confessor it is one of the best books I have ever read in my life. Each character is so unique but so connected to each other that you would think they were real people. The way they are written and how they interact and how they react to each other, everything just makes them believable. I feel as if I know them in real life. But it's not only the characters that are just WOW! It's the plot, the story, the lands. EVERYTHING! I don't want to give anything away, but watching the show I kind of knew how things ended. I mean, I know that the show and the books are totally different but I knew what happened to the characters. But at times when they were in danger I still held my breath and grew worried that they would be gone. Not only from the novel but from my life. Terry Goodkind is an amazing writer who created an amazing world full of loveable characters. This is one book I say you HAVE to read. That is if you want to know what great literature is. I did find a few grammar mistakes and such but they were very minor like a letter missing or a word was repeated. But put that aside, and you have a masterpeice in your hands. I will definatly have to re-read this book again in the very near future. Watch the show and read the books."
481,"Wizard's First Rule (Sword of Truth, #1)",0765346524,Terry Goodkind,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Dragonsinger,"Let me begin by saying I'm not a professional critic.  I loved this book as I loved the television series it spawned - ""Legend of the Seeker"".  It's full of action, romance and is packed with lessons that the right thing to do is not always easy.  If you are looking for a ""feel good"" book with a little fantasy action and romance you'll enjoy reading ""Wizard's First Rule"""

482,The Kitchen House,1439153663,Kathleen Grissom,Barnes and Noble,4.3,readtillyoudrop,"I purchased this book Friday night on my way home from work. I am usually a chapter a night reader; I started The Kitchen House Friday at midnight and read till 4:30am: 
I was awake at 8:30 and finish it. 

Grissom's writing creates such a colorful picture that you find yourself transported back in time. The characters are not just on the page, but are with you in such a way that you experience what they are experiencing. This is not a book that you merely read and put down, it stays with you. Papa George, Mama May, Belle and the host of other inhabitants of Tall Oaks pull you into their world and keep you hooked till the end. 

Though I normally don't read historical fiction I was brought in by it's haunting cover and after reading the prologue I couldn't put it down. I LOVED this book!"
482,The Kitchen House,1439153663,Kathleen Grissom,Barnes and Noble,4.3,retromom,"This story starts out with the prologue narrated by Lavinia. It depicts a horrible scene of a hanging. We know something bad has happened but we don't know why or to whom. The story then begins with Lavinia and Belle narrating alternating chapters. Lavinia is the young Irish girl who is orphaned on her family's journey to America and is taken in as an indentured servant by the ship's captain. Belle is a slave on the captain's plantation who also happens to be the daughter of the captain. Lavinia is sent to the kitchen house to be taken care of until the time that she can be of service. Lavinia becomes part of the family of Mama Mae, Papa George, Beattie, Fanny and Belle. The captain's family is pretty dysfunctional and plays a huge role in the lives of Lavinia and Belle. Lavinia eventually finds herself torn between two families and places in society. I like how the chapters alternate between Lavinia and Belle. The story flows beautifully between the two narrators. There is a lot going on in this book and I don't want to give the story line away. I think it is a story you have to experience and be surprised by. Trust me! It is a great story! There are times the story gets uncomfortable which makes it much more realistic feel than other books about the antebellum period. I could actually feel the fear of the characters at times. Once you get involved in the story of Lavinia and Belle you will not want to put this book down. I enjoyed this book very much and I highly recommend it. Don't read it too fast. You don't want to miss one morsel of this book. Kathleen Grissom does a fantastic job telling the story of The Kitchen House. I can't wait to read what she comes up with next!"

483,Franny and Zooey,0316769029,J.D. Salinger,Barnes and Noble,4.1,ArdentReader,"Most people know J.D. Salinger and have read ""Catcher in the Rye,"" but ""Franny and Zooey"" is a true gem. This is a small book about family and religious beliefs. This book will make you laugh out loud and cry. It is witty, funny and sad. If you want to see another side of J.D. Salinger, read this. I've read it a few times over the years and always find it new and enjoyable. 

Franny comes home a changed woman, and it is discovered that she's had a breakdown. She has begun reciting the Lords Prayer over and over much to the dismay of her intellectual family. The way her parents and brother Zooey deal with this is amusing and touching. If you love a classic than this is one to read. Forget about ""Catcher in the Rye,"" try this book that will touch your heart and your mind! After this you'll see J.D. Salinger in a whole new light."
483,Franny and Zooey,0316769029,J.D. Salinger,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"I absolutely hated Catcher in the Rye, thus was somewhat apprehensive about reading this work of Salinger. However, a freind continued to assure me I would love it, and once I picked it up, I actually did. It does have that slight hint of whining that Holden did in Catcher but otherwise, this actually has a story line and a plot and a reason for being. It's touching and makes you think and gave me a little slice of compassion. Though I will admit, you have to be in a certain mood in order to read this. Do not come looking for a happy-go-lucky, marvellous adventure, but rather a healing bit of insight for those weary with life."

484,Choke,0385720920,Chuck Palahniuk,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Middle_of_Nowhere,"This was the first book I have ever read by Chuck Palahniuk and I have to say I will never forget it. Sometime last year a friend gave me a list of books, one of the books happen to be Choke. She told me that the book was by the same guy who wrote Fight Club. I never new the movie Fight Club was based off a book and I thought because I enjoyed the movie so much I would give Choke a try. I found that this book was nothing like I have ever read before. It was so disgustingly enjoyable, I found myself lost in a world that I did not want to enter. Taboo isn't the right word, but it's the first word that comes to mind. After I finished reading this book, I could not figure out if I really liked it or not. The book had a refreshing originality to it, but I was not sure I would want to read it again. I continued to think about the book for the next following days, then it hit me: its not whether or not I like the book, it is that fact that I am still thinking about it. I think this is what Palahniuk was truly going for, he didn't care whether people liked it or not it was that people were thinking about his book. I still think about this book today and I am still not sure whether i really like it or not. However this is what makes it wonderful, I love not being able to explain things and define them. I have decided that this is one of my favorite books not because I like or don't like it but because I can't decide."

484,Choke,0385720920,Chuck Palahniuk,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Prahni,"From the very beginning of the novel Choke, by Chuck Palahniuk, we are instantly warned, ""If you're going to read this, don't bother."" This warning should be discarded immediately for this book was great. The main character, Victor Mancini, a med school drop-out, is a character that you really shouldn't like, but you do. You really can't help it! His perception on life is one to really think on, and by the end of the book you don't really want to leave his twisted world.
Palahniuk's  diction is simple and easy to understand, yet, the way he strings them together, create a picture unlike any other. Palahniuk certainly has a way of  reaching into our minds, disturbing us and all the while making his readers beg for more."

487,The Andromeda Strain,0060541814,Michael Crichton,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"Except for very few moments in the book, you would not realize this book was written in 1969. The idea of a biological pandemic is pretty common nowadays with zombie movies, the movie ""Outbreak,"" etc. but the way this story was presented and how the virus/bacteria comes into existence shows how brilliant and how much Crichton was ahead of his time. This was a very quick read but it is probably better suited for those who have at least a decent understanding of science and appreciate intellectual thrillers. This book makes you think, and if you can put this into perspective given the context of when this was written, you will love it."
487,The Andromeda Strain,0060541814,Michael Crichton,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,This book is excellent. Thrilling and very persuasive. I had seen the movie several times and was pleasantly surprised at how well the movie followed the book.

Withing minutes, the town is dead, as if they dropped for no reason in the middle of the night. Now, Wildfire is activated, summoning scientists from across the country to help solve the mystery of what happened, and why 2 lonely survivors managed to avoid the catastrophe that claimed so many others. But their time is limited, as soon their quarantine breaks and people start dying. A thrilling Sci-Fi novel that will leave you questioning things you never thought to ask before. You will feel as though you are a member of the wildfire team, discovering possible cures only to find that the virus has evolved into a new, deadlier form. I first discover Micheal Crichton through the wonderful novel of Jurassic park, and thought that he would be a one hit wonder author. I was pleased to find I was wrong, and reading this book shed new light on the world of biology for me. The entire novel is not a simple 'What-if?"" technology, all of it based off technology we do indeed have, if not a little more simplified and advanced, but based in reality nonetheless. Mr. Crichton, god rest him, was also a very well educated individual, sporting both his own speculations and those of other scientists who were experts on their respected subjects. I also enjoyed it because not only did I find myself thinking about the subjects I was reading about, but I was also generating my own knowledge and interest, and later found myself studying more about Biology simply so that I could read on a higher intellect level. Sci-Fi lovers would love it as well as scientists, as the book uses ideas that causes questions to be raised and answered, but only if the reader is truly paying attention to the book itself."
488,The Green Mile,0451933028,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.7,BAMBAM808,"Stephen King, the famous artist of spook tales and horror books probably created his best novel yet! The Green Mile, an interesting story like no other, talks about Paul Edgecomb and his life at the Louisiana State Penitentiary, it dates long back to the times of racism and Death Row. He has worked there all his life, but never before had been in a situation in where he has to choose between his job, the law, and possibly his life and doing whats right. This is definitely a book for you if you like a suspenseful book! Don't mind the number of pages! I definitely recommend this book for all you people who like a book about moral, justice, segregation, and a little twist at the end! Stephen King uses his fantastic, horrific ideas and blends it with a realistic conflict that keeps you on your toes. I couldn't put the book down! During my free time, I read page after page after page! Honestly, I was never a reader to begin with! But, this book changed my perspective of reading! After reading this novel I craved for more of Stephen King's fantastic books. I now am convinced that King is one of the best authors, his way of style, his lessons, and his use of imagery (especially the execution of Delacroix, or the scene with Melinda Moores), Stephen King truly brings his art to life! I believe everyone should take some time out of their busy life to read this book. I give Stephen King a hand for another successful novel."

I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel.  While not tracking entirely with the movie, it tells the exact same story and then some.  If you are a fan of the movie, you need to read the book."
488,The Green Mile,0451933028,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Anonymous,"This book, The Green Mile by Stephen King, shocked me.  As a ninth grader who does not get around to recreational reading, I was absolutely surprised how engaging this book was.  I have never read a book that grabbed my attention like this one has.  The first thing that I noticed about the book was the the author's name, Stephen King, which I have seen all over television commercials that are advertising a new T.V series or something.  So I thought I would give this book a try.  I am so happy that I did, Stephen King's ability to put such emotion in a book is outstanding.  The description is so precise.  He easily paints every scene that he describes in my head.  You might be thinking that you probably won't like it, because you are not a reader.  Well I'm like that, someone who finds it almost impossible to read a book that is uninteresting.  But, this book is completely worth all the long hours you put in.  I was completely drawn to this book.  It provided me with a completely new look upon reading books, I have never actually wanted to keep on reading like this before.  I strongly urge people to pick up a copy of this book.

    I loved the description used in every page.  Stephen King can take such a minor detail and dilate it into something much more.  Beside the amazing emotion and description, I loved the character John Coffey.  He is a tall, broad African American who seems very mysterious in the beginning of the book.  However, I like to compare him to a modernized, human form of God.  He takes in all the bad of the world and only tries to release good and peace.  He must have looked quite intimidating at first because he towers over the guards and is so thick.  However, John does not try to cause any trouble, he remains calm.  John Coffey was a great contribution to why I adore this book.  Along with the characters, emotion, and description; I liked the perspective that Stephen King used.  The way that the book is written in one of the guard's perspective is momentous.  If it was written in John's perspective, then it wouldn't give the book as much suspense.  The guard's perspective gave the ability to give a great description on what John looks like.

    Overall, this book is worth the time that you put in to read it.  You can take many values that the book touches upon.  I strongly urge you to take the time to find this book and let your mind get lost in the pure beauty of the book."
489,The Prophet,000100039X,Kahlil Gibran,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Guest,"I remember I had to read this book in high school.  I was 16, and quite frankly, hanging out with my friends and partying were much more fun than some silly homework assignment.  Fast forward 19 years.  I was in B&N a few weeks ago, and I happened to have stumbled on the book.  I wanted  something to read, so I thought, 'Eh, why not?  It looks like a quick read.' So, I bought it. Well, all I can say is, 'Wow! What a disservice I did to myself back then by not reading this book!'  Then again, maybe I wasn't prepared for such an awesome piece of work.  I think you need to experience life to really appreciate this book.  My first time reading it, I was BLOWN AWAY.  I actually started crying in a few areas of the book because I could relate so much of it to my own life and experiences.  The first time, I read it as a novel.  Now, I use it as a reference tool for life.  When my son rebels, I turn to the 'Parenting' section.  When my heart was broken earlier this year, I went to the 'Love' section.  Sometimes, my intensity is too much for daily life, so that's when I flip to the 'Reason vs Passion' section.  I have read a lot of books in my time, but I must say that this is probably the most SPECIAL book I have ever had or read.  Now, I'm not some super-intellectual who dwells in the World of the Intelligencia.  I'm just a regular person who really needed a book like this in her life.  Honestly, I think Mr. Gibran wrote this book for people like me. Heck, I was thinking that he wrote it JUST for me :-)  Enjoy."
489,The Prophet,000100039X,Kahlil Gibran,Barnes and Noble,4.7,E-Bennet,"When I picked this up, I had no idea what to expect. My mouth stands open. I feel like I've read a map to the entryway of my soul. I keep going back and reading my favorite parts over and over. I am in love with these words. They come off the page in my own voice, like they speak from somewhere I have been already, remember acutely. Gibran himself is a prophet, only a prophet could speak such true words. I want to quote him here to give you a taste, here the prophet is speaking of love:

""For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning.

Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun,

So shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth.

Like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto himself.

He threshes you to make you naked.

He sifts you to free you from your husks

He grinds you to whiteness.

He kneads you until you are pliant;

And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you may become sacred bread for God's sacred feast.

...

But if in your fear you would seek only love's peace and love's pleasure,

Then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of love's threshing-floor,

Into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, and weep, but not all of your tears.""

-Kahlil Gibran"

490,"Maus I: A Survivor's Tale: My Father Bleeds History (Maus, #1)",0394541553,Art Spiegelman,Barnes and Noble,4.4,KatieSpears on LibraryThing,"Maus I: A Survivor's Tale is a graphic novel by Art Spiegelman depicting his father's survival of the Holocaust.  This book is a biography even if it is a graphic novel becasue Spiegelman is telling his father's life story as it happened.  This book was written in 1973, but the majority of the action takes place during the flashbacks to the 1930's and 1940's during World War II and the events leading up to it.  In this book, the Jews are portrayed as mice, the Nazi's are portrayed as cats, and the Poles are portrayed as pigs.  Even with the people as animals, the story is still very human and real.This novel is about Art Spiegelman's father, Vladek, and how he survived the Holocaust.  The story begins with Art coming to his father and saying he wants to write a graphic novel about his life during World War II.  Vladek agrees, and Art continues to visit and record Vladek's tale.  Vladek begins his story with how he managed to marry Anja his first wife.  Vladek relates his story of how he had to fight in the war to keep the Germans out, and from there his experiences go down hill.  He returns home to find it has been transformed into a world ruled by the Nazi's.  From that point, life is about being smart in business and being smart in trusting people.  He has to hide with his family in bunkers he made.  Eventually, they are found out, but by that point, Vladek and Anja's family has dwindled down to only a few members.  The remaining family members get split up, and Vladek and Anja go into hiding and try to escape to Hungary.  The end of the novel is about their experiences in trying to be safely smuggled across the border to Hungary.This book is amazing.  It is so interesting that basically a cartoon strip with animals as people can tell such a moving story.  I think because the people are animals is what makes this tale so memorable.  The subject matter is, of course, very interesting, but the way Art Spiegelman doesn't leave anything our or sugar coat his dad's ornery behavior while telling the story is what engaged me as a reader.  It was very truthful even when the truth didn't show Vladek in a positive light, and I appreciated that Spiegelman kept it true to form.  This book raises the issue of the controversies of the Holocaust.  I think Spiegelman's opinion is that the Holocaust was horrific, but he feels it's his job to tell a true story so that younger generations can learn from history.  I agree with Spiegelman.  Had my family survived the Holocaust, I would feel obligated to raise awareness on such issues.  I think this book is extremely similar to Night by Elie Wiesel.  Night is a biography/fiction novel about Wiesel's own survival of the Holocaust.  Even though the story is about Wiesel's personal experiences, the book is still considered a fiction novel.  However, Night is brutally truthfull as well and show the horrors of the Holocaust in few words used in an effective way.  I think this book raises the issue of modern genocides that should be made known and stopped.  I feel more passionate now that awareness is a big step in actions against hate.Teaching ideas:-Watch Schindler's List, The Pianist, or The Devil's Arithmatic-Group project on modern genocide-Explore the meaning of mice, cats, and pigs as the people in the novelMaus is a moving graphic novel that keeps the emotion of such a powerful story very real.  The way this serious topic is presented is still respectful and tasteful because it is to inform not to ridicule.  The book's issues of hate and the Holocaust stir a need for action today against modern genocide.  Maus's main point is of survival and love that can survive anything.  I think this book would be a great book to read in the classroom because it is a difficult subject matter in an interesting a new way and because the story is so real and moving."
490,"Maus I: A Survivor's Tale: My Father Bleeds History (Maus, #1)",0394541553,Art Spiegelman,Barnes and Noble,4.4,amygatt on LibraryThing,"This was the first graphic novel I ever read, and I really liked it.  The Holocaust is very difficult to write about, and writing about it in this visual medium made this story even more powerful.  The fact that Art Spiegelman kept his voice very strong throughout this text really enhanced it, because the story is so close to him - it is about his own family's struggle in the Holocaust.  I read this book in college, but I might recommend this book even to a reader in late middle school, especially as they study the Holocaust in school.  This book brings readers closer than ever to this difficult period in history and helps them to see that family members of those who survived the Holocaust still suffer because of it.  Incorporating this text into a unit on the Holocaust would help students to relate to this subject on a more personal level."

He wants to write a graphic novel about his life.  This tale about his father is at times brutally honest and painful to read.  Artie has issues with his father, but has great sympathy for what he has been through.  Students will learn about the holocaust and the effect it would have on those who had to live through it.  The fact that it is a graphic novel makes it very appealing."
491,"Untamed (House of Night, #4)",0312379838,"P.C. Cast, Kristin Cast",Barnes and Noble,4.5,BANCHEE_READS,"This is the fourth book in the House of Night series and was by far the best book of the series. It is the only book in the series so far that I have felt comfortable saying I really liked it and enjoyed the story.
With the murders of the teachers in the third book things are beginning to come to a head in this book. Zoey is out of boyfriends, so to speak, so of course she is absolutely enchanted by the new kid in school, Stark. With Stevie Rae somewhat her normal self, she takes a back seat in this story but still plays a few big parts as a new type of vampire. The mythos developed in this story around the evil Neferet was engaging and very interesting. Neferet is here in all her evil glory; and man is she evil.
Zoey without boyfriends is awesome because Zoey is actually focused on the actual plot and this makes for a way more interesting book than the last one was. So, for everyone who hung on with the series despite the barely okay third book, you are rewarded in this book."
491,"Untamed (House of Night, #4)",0312379838,"P.C. Cast, Kristin Cast",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Nicole_Redbird,"This book is sexy, mysterious, and will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very last word. Highly recommend!"
491,"Untamed (House of Night, #4)",0312379838,"P.C. Cast, Kristin Cast",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"I have enjoyed reading ""The House of Night"" series. I received the four books for Christmas and finished them in no time. The books are about a human-turned fledgling vampyre named Zoey Redbird who goes to a school called The House of Night where those like herself go to learn what they need to know before they become full-fledged vampyres, if they get that far. Some make it, some don't.
Zoey makes a lot of friends (and enemies), and I'm especially fond of her best friend Stevie Rae who has such a wonderful personality. As for her other friends, Damien and the Twins, well, they are, to me, quite boring.If anything were to happen to them I don't think I'd really care much. (I nearly died inside when I thought Stevie Rae was gone.) That says a lot.
As for the main character herself, she is not my favorite. Usually I like the main characters but Zoey tends to get into a lot of situations concerning boys and it's a bit annoying (I believe it was the third book that involved a lot of that). She started off with her human boyfriend Heath. Then got herself a vampyre-fledgling boyfriend, Eric. Then there's the vampyre Poet teacher Loren. And WHAT was with that Stark business? She didn't even KNOW the guy. I'm just thankful the books involve more than Zoey's boyfriend business, otherwise I wouldn't like these books very much.
There's always something new happening. The story never gets boring, which is excellent--- except when it involves Zoey's boyfriend woes.
Overall, I love this series and I can't wait for the next book."
492,"Speaker for the Dead (Ender's Saga, #2)",0812550757,Orson Scott Card,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"Posted 11/02/10: This book was written as the second book in a series but Orson Scott Card. Card tried to write it in a way that you could read it without any background knowledge. I have not read the first one yet and I would agree that you can read this book by itself; however there were some points in the book where a little background knowledge would have been nice. Orson Scott Card is an excellent writer. I loved how the main character, Ender Wiggin, seemed to know everything about other peoples past without really knowing anything at all. The tone in this book was excellent. The main character is portrayed as a brilliant and understanding person. However, some of my favorite characters in the story were the piggies, an alien species discovered on a planet that was going to be settled for human use, who got their nickname piggies from their pig like faces. Card dives so deeply into the feeling and emotions of each and every character that it is very easy to relate to each one. Another thing I like about this book was how life like the struggle was shown between the humans and piggies to understand and learn from each other. I didn't like the point in the book where the piggies innocently and ignorantly murdered two of the humans studying them. It was frustrating reading that part because the actions of the piggies were not explained until a lot farther into the book. I often enjoy science fiction books that take place in the future. In this book Card writes about the future in a believable fashion. I think the overall lesson that can be learned from this book is lying and hiding the truth will just hurt a lot worse in the long run. This is shown though both the humans and the piggies. One of the main human characters hides the truth from her family and does everything in her power to keep it hidden. When Ender comes he dives deep into her past and finds out the truth, it is hurtful to everyone especially her and her family. It takes some time, but life moves on much easier after everyone knows the truth. I really liked how Ender used his high position as Speaker For The Dead and his ultra smart computer friend to get information and respect from un-willing people, and it is amazing what he does with the information. The ending of this book doesn't really seem like an ending. The book seems to end with one chapter left. The last chapter seems to be dedicated to the groundwork for the next book. It has a cliff hanger ending for this reason which I didn't really like. I like books to come to a clear conclusion at the end but where this book is not the last book in the series Card still has a chance to wrap things up and I look forward to the place where he does. Overall, I enjoyed reading this book."
492,"Speaker for the Dead (Ender's Saga, #2)",0812550757,Orson Scott Card,Barnes and Noble,4.4,GeekyBeachBabe,"Orson Scott Card's Speaker for the Dead is quite a different story from Ender's Game, but it's a great one. The setting is new, the characters are mostly all new and Ender is 3,000 years older (sort of). Unlike the first book, my favorite parts of this book have almost nothing to do with Ender. Rather, I'm all about the aliens in this one.

Much of this story takes place before Ender even arrives, which gives the reader a great chance to acclimate to the new surroundings. We are now on the planet Lusitania and we're even further in the future. There are so many new and wonderful human characters in this book and each has their own separate identity; I both loved and hated most of them. (I think I also picked up a bit of Portuguese from reading this book!)

The alien characters, aka the ""Piggies"" are extremely complex and mysterious while at the same time very lovable. Never could I have imagined reading a book in which I care so much about the aliens (maybe more than the people!). Perhaps the best thing about this book is that no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't figure out the twist at the end so it was a real and unpredictable surprise ending which I love.

I really loved this book - it's one of those books you wish didn't have to end. If you've read Ender's Game and loved it, I think you''ll love this one, too.

[Side note: I have read the next two in the series, but my advice is that if you want to remember the good times, stop after Speaker for the Dead and that way you can always think of Ender fondly.]"
492,"Speaker for the Dead (Ender's Saga, #2)",0812550757,Orson Scott Card,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Barnesie,"When you read how Orson Scott Card came to write Speaker for the Dead, it's all but specifically stated that the entire book was conceived without the character of Ender existing within its text.  It comes as no surprise that when he plucks his biggest character from his biggest hit and inserts him into a storyline thousands of years in the future, it's a slightly uncomfortable fit.  At 3000 years old, Ender is all grow'd up and is now plodding forward in a new story that bears little connection to his previous existence in Enders Game.  He now finds himself wrapped up in a bio-evolutionary mystery plot, with a rag tag bunch of natives and his trusty omnipotent sidekick cracking wise from the ether of the universe.  Will Ender somehow unravel the mystery of the Piggies?  Will Ender fall in love?  Will Orson Scott Card introduce a predictable ticking time bomb and then leave a rack of open questions so that the next book is more of a ""part 2"" then a squeal?  I'll save you the trouble, the answer is yes."
493,Mere Christianity,0684823780,C.S. Lewis,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"The essentials of Christianity are presented in an enlightening, easy-to-grasp narrative.  Both Christian and non-Christians benefit from reading this book. Christians will gain new insights as to why they believe  non-Christians will find a brilliant exposition of basic Christian beliefs. It certainly will provoke you to carefully consider what and why you believe.  Lewis writes, 'You must make your choice. Either this man [Christ] was, and is, the Son of God: or else a madman or something worse...But let us not come with any patronising nonsense about his being a great human teacher.'"
493,Mere Christianity,0684823780,C.S. Lewis,Barnes and Noble,4.4,WriterAtTheSea,"This book should be savored.  Hands down, it is probably one of my favorite books covering simple Christian beliefs without dragging dogma or denominational theory into it.  The brilliant Lewis appeals to both logic and common sense.  For the believer, this book should not be missed, and for the non-believer, Mere Christianity offers a logical, persuasive argument for belief.  It is probably one of the most influential Christian books in the twentieth century. His presentation and argument for the case for belief in Christ is profound.  I don't think there is a book that has affected my faith more outside of scripture."
493,Mere Christianity,0684823780,C.S. Lewis,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"I have read this book many times at many different places in my life. When I arrogantly assume I know all there is to know and that I am such a well-learned scholar that someone like Lewis must be overrated and it is my job to perform an exhaustive analysis, I find this book, and truthfully anything else I read, falls short.  However, when I humbly open my heart and mind and ask questions such as, 'Does God exist?' 'Does God really love me?' and 'What can I learn about God through this?' I find that I am filled with the wonder and joy that Lewis offers like a gift.  Read up on Lewis' life and you will find that he was disappointed by life and love - yes he did fall in love - and learned time and time again to rest in the wonder and peace of God. This book is an installment in his life's work.  Don't make the mistake of reading this through the filter of arrogance - no matter how well-educated you are or how much you think you know."
494,The Secret History,1400031702,Donna Tartt,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"What makes 'The Secret History' such a   compelling book is its daring to examine the  consequences of the arrogance of intellectual superiority, something I   struggled with in my youth, something which I sometimes find myself struggling with today.  Those of us who were products of accelerated  academic programs, who fell under the   auspicious acronmym AP (for Advanced Placement) often felt removed from our peers and masked our underlying feelings of inferiority as erudite superiority.  It is a defence mechanism many of us used when young,and sometimes continue to use as a means we tell ourselves of making us feel better about who we are.  The students in  TSH, even the sympathetic narrator Richard  Papen, exemplify these ideas and the impulses  these feelings cause them to act out are shown as having the direst of moral consequences to which they as a group and individually must answer for.      The pleasures of intellectual stimulation   coupled with the psychological underpinings of the deed done and how it is played out give TSH its literary resonance.  In addition the book provides a builti in mystery of its own--namely the literary future, or if there is to be one, of its author, Donna Tartt.    Upon a first reading nearly ten years ago,   I embraced TSH and Donna Tartt as a voice I wanted to hear more of--a voice which has been noticeably and mysteriously silent, which has only served to build up the legend, and rumors of an impending second novel sometime next year.  This remains to be seen but TSH continues to remain a book I turn to time and again for its exploration of moral arrogance and the destruction such attitudes can incur."

494,The Secret History,1400031702,Donna Tartt,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,A really tense mystery;  well-defined characters. You want to reach out and implore them to stop.  Intelligence and narcissism and exclusivity and wealth and bored youth are a dangerous mix.

Worth the read, but not for casual readers as you'll want to finish the book in one sitting.  Eggers is a ""trip""."
495,A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,0375725784,Dave Eggers,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Jessie93,Definitely an interesting read.  You need patience to read this book.  Eggers is a total scatter-brains. There will be numerous time throughout the book that you will feel like there is no point to the book at all. You will read page after page of nothing.  The young Eggers in this memoir can be very self-absorbed and that is very annoying. Some parts are mildly entertaining and his thought process is completely over the top.  Seems like a good book for a psychologist to read and then come up with a proper diagnosis.

Auel,Barnes and Noble,4.4,MagiV,"So sad - I have all of this series in hard copy, but really wanted them on my new Nook, especially with the new Land of the Painted Caves coming out next month!  I started reading at the beginning, and was immediately struck by how AWFUL the translation to eBook had been - NEVER occurred to me that B&N didn't get access to the electronic files which the printers use when printing up new books, right? - NEVER occurred to me these books were OCRed, which means that many times the words are incorrect or missing.  There are formatting issues like italics where it does not belong, a sentence that runs right off the page of the Nook never wrapping around.  Punctuation that was incorrect or completely missing.  And, unlike the old classics, we have to PAY for this.  I actually needed to use my hard copy to be sure of what I was reading - in each edition!
I wrote a letter of disgust to B&N, and was told - in short, that my issues were being sent on to the publisher and when they made corrections, it would automatically be uploaded to my Nook - BUT, that I was not entitled to any kind of refund per B&N blah, blah, blah....  Very sad.  I have many other books on my Nook that are 10 & 20 years old yet there are no ""typos"" in those books.  Be warned!"

Auel,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"My father read the books, and everytime he read a few chapters, he went into my room to tell me all about it. After he finished, he gave the books to me. I was fifteen, and layed them away for a year. After that year I found them again, and read the first page. I almost read the entire chapter there, down of the floor in front of my bookcase.  I have never before and probably will never again fall in love with a book as much as I did with these. And especially The Clan of the Cavebear. I've just read it for the eleventh time (for real!) and still found things I missed the first times. These books opened my eyes to the full experience of reading a book. Not only reading, but seeing, feeling, living and breathing a book. I can absolutely recommend it to everyone, although you do have to consider all the extra text concerning the environment and animals present. I loved them, I love to learn, but others will find it difficult to read long descriptions. In any way, it is a book worth reading, more than most are!"

497,Black Beauty,0439228905,Anna Sewell,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"When I first picked up this book, it was a late in the evening at the local library.  I was a young girl, barely eight years old and I was struggling with some very difficult situations at home.  There was a rift in my family, centered around me and it caused me to burrow into myself, not allowing for the easy childhood friendships that I should have had.  At that time I was discovering books, but they were not quite what I was looking for.  Sort of like picking up appears to be a soft drink and finding out it's really tea.  Bearable, but not quite right.  So I went looking for a book, not because I was aware of what I really needed, but because my young soul was lonely and broken.  Black Beauty and I spent much of the next few weeks together as I read and then reread the story over and again.  He understood my pain like no one else ever could.  Together we raced the wind under fair weather and toiled up great hills against odds that no one should ever have had to face.  He was my companion, as I was his.  Recently, I picked up the book again and found myself dwelling on those long ago days.  I can still remember the feel of soft grass as I lay with Black Beauty, full of pain but still able to gaze upon the bright flowers around me.  To be able to see beauty, even when life is not at its best, was the gift that I most needed and the lesson that the story teaches us all."
497,Black Beauty,0439228905,Anna Sewell,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,Black Beauty is a great book about a horse. It's a book about a horse's life and his point of view about life.Black Beauty expresses his so well you would think Anna Sewell the author was actually a horse because she knows so much about a horse's point of view and their lives. This book is so wonderful that sometimes it seems as if you want to be a horse just like Black Beauty! This is by far the greatest classic I have ever read! I will remember this book forever because of Black Beauty's loyalty to his owners no matter how much he was mistreated by some of them! Black Beauty will always stand in my mind as the greatest horse book of all times!

The formatting of this ebook was masterful as well. Very professional and no errors.  Worth every penny."

498,War and Peace,0192833987,"Leo Tolstoy, Henry Gifford, Aylmer Maude, Louise Maude",Barnes and Noble,3.8,Anonymous,This is an awesome book and you must take great care to ensure you are getting a copy that suits your requirements.  Look for a quality translation - Prevear should do it for most people.  I have tried several of the free downloads of this book for my nook and they are quite unreadable.  The amount of spelling mistakes is unbelievable - do this book the justice it deserves and treat yourself to a good copy!
499,American Psycho,0679735771,Bret Easton Ellis,Barnes and Noble,4.1,ChesterfieldWatts,"""American Psycho"" is not only a great critique of the 80's yuppie culture, but it is a scathing criticism of a nation's moral decay. The book is very well written, and it has a style that creates a world easily accessible to the reader. The book creates a dissonance from real life and the actual plot that leaves the reader questioning if our narrator, dear Patrick, is a reliable source or nothing more than a raving mad-man. The wonder of Ellis's writing is that, while asking this question, the overwhelming fact is that it doesn't really matter. While Bateman, the main character, is a psychopathic killer, it is easy to empathize with him and understand his frustrations. The writing style is unique and makes it easy to get into Bateman's mindset. I usually am not a detail-oriented reader, and I often prefer to have my own imagination work than the author's descriptions, but long sections devoted to clothes and other such details really are a pleasure to read in this book, mostly because they help the reader see the world as Bateman does. A unique read to be certain, but wildly entertaining."
499,American Psycho,0679735771,Bret Easton Ellis,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"To each his own... but personally I find the conplaints about the over abundance of details, especially regarding the clothing brands, to be an absolute joke. Dismissing these details as mundane is dismissing tge entire message of the book. Theyre yuppies... every thing was scrutinized down to the last detail. Where you ate, what you ordered, who you were with, what you wore, who cut your hair... these details were everything that mattered. 

As for the violence, its a sattire and the book is halarious. The point is the extreme of being such a ridiculous yuppy that your more worried about reservations than your compulsion to kill and also hating everyone but helplessly obsessing over having everyone love you..."
499,American Psycho,0679735771,Bret Easton Ellis,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Stumpyboner,"This book is awful. I read it due to a friend's recommendation. I didn't realize at the time that he was a hip counter-culture kind of guy (the kind that tell you that the things you like are terrible, and that terrible things are good). American Psycho has no plot at all. The book begins with an intriguing literary method of hooking the reader. Bret E. Ellis introduces us to the neuroses of the Antagonist, Patrick; this is done by way of first-person introspection into Patrick's inner thoughts. This is fantastic, hence the one star that I did give the book. After that, there is no plot progression at all. There is no dichotomy to exploit between characters, no antagonist, and even Patrick lacks any dynamic character development. There is no plot; that is not to say that the plot is poor; there is no plot at all. This book is just a perpetual repetition of the (at first) intriguing introspection into Patrick's psyche, and his resultant outbursts of rage.
I find the repetition insulting. If this book was a novella, then it may have been brilliant; Ellis' one narrative hook is unable to carry a reader who enjoys a dynamic journey complete with plot, conflict, and character development."

The book is way better, and has no ending, you have to read it in the next book, and its the fact that the father never died, she never had a ball, and the book was way more interesting! It had many more details about her best friend, mom and grandma! So i do reccomend this book! Boys and girls! Dont get tricked by the title, not bout PRINCESSES!!"

The book gives insight into life and tradition in some parts of Africa. While there aren't any what you'd call belly laughs, there is humor throughout the book, a lot of human nature both good and bad, and many small mysteries instead of one or two big ones like in the more conventional mysteries we're used to. A good read once you adapt to the style."

The best word to describe the book is ""quirky"", but in a good way.  The writing style was not typical and the characters had an interesting way of conveying what they wanted to say without actually saying it.  I had not heard of the series before, but I plan on reading the rest of the books in the series and I have added the HBO television series to my Netflix queue as well."
501,"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency  (No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, #1)",1400034779,Alexander McCall Smith,Barnes and Noble,3.6,TATERSIS,"A compelling book that whisks you away to a faraway land and lets you peek into a different culture.  I really enjoyed the setting and the way the local culture and proctocol were defined.  Having read another reivew, I was always on the lookout for the ""man bashing"" parts.  I  have to admit there was a tendency to generalize men and their ""bad"" habits, but it was not so much offensive as it was quirky.  I have to remember that this tendency to mistrust men came from the heroine's background and history.  Funny; sweet; and sad all at the same time.  A quick read and I will most certainly look for and read other books by this author.  Surprised that this was a male author."
502,"The Walking Dead, Vol. 01: Days Gone Bye",1582406723,"Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Suvorov,"Graphic novels are not my thing so giving this five stars is a really big thing. When I first saw the previews of the tv series, I wanted to read the comics first. I was hooked from the beginning.
 
Since I am accustomed to very long books, The Walking Dead seemed a little choppy at first. In addition, I had some problems following the bubbles and would mix them up, which of course messes up the flow and tempo because I had to go back and re-read. But I quickly got the flow of it and the reading got easier.
 
I am in the process of reading the series a second time. I am taking it slower and studying the pictures better, which obviously enhances the story- something I am sure any graphic novel/ comic fan would tell you is a must. I am enjoying it even more the second time around. For any first time readers, I would recommend reading slowly. It is tempting to get through it fast just to finish it, but it is much more satisfying to take your time. Also, you'll remember more and when you watch the tv series, that will help you compare the tv show with the series.
 
I think Kirkman did a great job developing the characters quickly. Right away I had my favorites. Unfortunately, my least favorite character is Lori. She is a nag, nowhere near self-sufficient and has totally refused to accept that her environment has drastically changed and she will have to change with it if she wants to survive. It's annoying.
 
And no one is safe. So while you may not be able to detach yourself from a particular character, don't be surprised if that character doesn't make it. Even main characters aren't safe. That is one of the things I really like about Kirkman. He can make me scream at a book.
 
If you have already watched the tv series, you will notice a lot of differences from the very beginning. While the tv series stays true to the spirit of the books, the details are much different. Characters are different and they don't die in the same order or in the same way. I know some people don't like that, but I think it works in this case. If the tv series was exactly the same, there would be no surprises for me. This way, while I know the general direction of the tv series, I am constantly surprised.
 
Bottom line, give it a try. This is coming from someone who had never read a graphic novel before this one. Now I follow 4 different series. The Walking Dead may make a convert out of you."

(A REVIEW)

Once upon a time I was one of those women that was scared to death of zombies and I wouldn't even watch anything that had them on it. I didn't want to see pictures I would turn my head in disgust and literally run away almost screaming at the sight. I think deep down it was always the thought of 'what if' that kept me from wanting to have anything to do with a genre that is becoming rapidly more popular. Those days ended when my husband decided we were going to watch ""The Walking Dead"" on AMC.

I was instantly hooked, and it really had nothing to do with the zombies as much as it did the humanity of the people that were still living. The books are no different. Having read the first one in a series I can honestly say I intend to seek them all out one by one.
You get a feeling of what it would truly be like to live through such a horrible plague and discover that you are perhaps one of the last living people on the planet. There is emotion, turmoil, truth and sincerity in these graphic novels as well as the show on television.

You soon even begin to feel sorry for those that have been turned and you have to ask yourself what you would do if that happened to someone in your family. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised and now I'm not as horrified by the zombies as I once was. Robert Kirkman has done a phenomenal job and I can only hope he'll continue with the story for as long as he can.

502,"The Walking Dead, Vol. 01: Days Gone Bye",1582406723,"Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Mr_E58,"Being a fan of the series on AMC I thought the comic series might prove interesting. Jeeze was I right. Despite knowing the gist of some of the goings on in the beginning due to the tv series, I found the read still very addicting. The only time I became upset was when I finished reading because I needed more...

All in all, Days Gone Bye is an awesome read and I suggest those interested should buy it. I know I will be buying the rest of the series."

An alien civilization is portrayed as being so advanced beyond human beings as to be almost completely incomprehensible.  The science and technology is very accurate and credible.  Predictions are implied in the mid sixties of the technology of the twenty first century.  This story became a landmark and set the standard for many science fiction stories to follow."

I went to highest rated books on amazon. this has 777 5 star reviews so I read the overview of the book. it was obviously a christian love story and I was like, nah, God can't be in a romance book, it won't be good. so I kept looking for my newest read...and kept being pulled back to Redeeming Love. I gave in and bought the ebook for my nook. I do not exagerate when I say I was hypnotised by these characters, moved by Angels story and sobbed, not cried, for almost all of this book. I have never been so emotionally involved in a story in all my life and I am an AVID reader. How stupid of me to think that a Love story involving God would be too ""clean"" and boring. God is Love and he created man and woman to love in the most beautiful way. This story is so much more meaningful then a vampire/werewolf love story. There's purpose and meaning and morals and lessons all wrapped up in a powerful love story that leaves you fulfilled in a way you didn't know a book could leave you. this is now my favorite book of all time."
504,Redeeming Love,1590525132,Francine Rivers,Barnes and Noble,4.8,Anonymous,"This book is a heart-wrenching, beautiful example of what God intended love between a husband and wife to be. Michael and Angel.
Angel kept running away, feeling unworthy of love, only deserving the so-called love that the world showed her, which was empty and fake.
Michael's character shows the reader true unconditional love and endless patience.
This is a beautiful, heartwarming, touching story of love, sacrifice, great heart, and grace.  There is no question in my mind that anyone who reads this will not be able to hold back the tears! A MUST READ FOR ALL!"
504,Redeeming Love,1590525132,Francine Rivers,Barnes and Noble,4.8,Guest,God's love for us just pours out in this book. I found myself crying in wonder at how much God really does love us to take us back into His arms after every time we mess up. The book was perfect and it still stands as my favorite. Every single person on earth should read this book!

1014,"So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, #4)",0330491237,Douglas Adams,Barnes and Noble,4.3,1000_Character_Reviews,"Well...on to the forth (and almost last) of the original set of Hitchhiker's Guide books.  We find Arthur Dent back on Earth, which has not been destroyed (I won't spoil the how on this &ndash; especially as I&rsquo;m not completely clear on how Ford pulled it off) looking to help a girl he's fallen in love with, figure out why he's been given a fishbowl with a strange inscription, figuring out where all the dolphins went, trying to find his battered copy of the Hitchhiker's Guide and finally finding the message that God left for all of creation (which falls along the lines of 42 as the answer to Life, the Universe and Everything).   The mystery-like storyline combined with the series&rsquo; characteristic sarcasm definitely makes it very hard to put down.  I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s the funniest of the books thus far with the healthy dose of irreverent humor we've come to expect from this series."

I wasn't prepared for a love story when starting this book.  It was, howeve, good enough to grab and hold may attention.  So much so that while reading it in an airport, I was so engrossed that I missed my flight."

1015,Steppenwolf,0140282580,"Hermann Hesse, Basil Creighton",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"Steppenwolf tells the story of alienated intellectual Harry Haller and his mid-life crisis.  Actually, to say that this book tells a story is a bit misleading.  Steppenwolf is not the book for you if you are looking for a riveting, action filled plot and a literal, straightforward ending.  Steppenwolf is riveting in an entirely different way.  It provides a window into Harry's troubled soul.  The physical world and its inhabitants take a backseat to Haller's rich, symbol-laden inner realms.  

Although written in the 1920's, Steppenwolf reached a height of popularity in the 1960's and 1970's.  The little action that does take place in this book largely revolves around Harry's introduction to jazz club night life and his casual affair with a pretty young courtesan.  The closing sequence, an intense, surrealistic immersion in the ""Magic Theater"" of Harry's mind, is popularly interpreted as a drug-induced hallucination.  Due to these themes, Steppenwolf is sometimes touted as a vindication of free-love and drug culture.  I believe that this is a somewhat limiting interpretation of the book.  Hesse's writings chronicle his own development as a person.  In his earlier novel Demian, one character observes ""If you hate a person, you hate something in him that is part of yourself.""  In Steppenwolf, Hesse portrays a man who must come to terms with those rejected parts of himself, particularly those he finds most shallow, sensual, and animalistic.  The symbolism is heavily influenced by Hesse's experience with Jungian analysis, and having some familiarity with Jung's ideas greatly helps in understanding the odder portions of the novel.  The Magic Theater sequence presents and recommends a ruthlessly honest self-examination, followed by an expansion of consciousness beyond the self.  Such experiences are accessible to people in many forms of deep mediation and psychological therapies as well as through drugs.

In a wonderful paradox, Hesse wrote frankly individualistic autobiographical fiction, yet hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people have identified themselves strongly with Hesse's characters.  Steppenwolf is not for everyone.  Most people seem to have a strong positive or negative reaction to this kind of work.  I found this a powerful, thought provoking read, and highly recommend it for introspective readers."
1015,Steppenwolf,0140282580,"Hermann Hesse, Basil Creighton",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,Only Hesse can make a reader tremble as he/she reads about himself; self projected images abound.
1015,Steppenwolf,0140282580,"Hermann Hesse, Basil Creighton",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"Hesse has managed to bring out a beauty in misery.  It's an excellent book, poetically writen, touching story, and a good challenge for the mind."

1017,The Girl You Left Behind,0670026611,Jojo Moyes,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Cupcakegirly,"You need this book in your life!

Anyone who knows me knows I'm rarely at a loss for words but that's exactly how this story, which began in the prequel novella, has left me. Trying to put my thoughts/feelings/emotions into coherent sentences is quite a challenging task especially when the tears just.won't.stop. I read Jojo Moyes' ME BEFORE YOU and loved it, so when this one was recommended to me, I pounced and have come to the conclusion that I will read anything this woman writes! 

Whether you are a fan of historical fiction or not, (I'm generally not) THE GIRL YOU LEFT BEHIND is a heart achingly gorgeous story of unwavering love and incredible sacrifice. It will pull you in, wrap itself around your heartstrings and refuse to let go until you have laughed, cried and hugged the ones you love just a little bit tighter. 

Trust me when I tell you that YOU NEED THIS BOOK IN YOUR LIFE!"
1017,The Girl You Left Behind,0670026611,Jojo Moyes,Barnes and Noble,4.5,irishclaireKG,"Wonderful.                                                                                                                               While I was ambivalent about Moyes' previous novels, there is not enough to say about this one.  It is thoroughly engrossing and engaging to the point you WILL stay up all night reading; the character of Sophie will keep you absolutely fixated.  Moyes' depictions of WWI suffering and trauma is harrowing, and there is simply nothing in the novel that drags.  Others have noted humor here and while there are a few (very few) more light hearted moments, this is a story of trauma, loss, suffering and ultimately, redemption.  Pick it up."
1017,The Girl You Left Behind,0670026611,Jojo Moyes,Barnes and Noble,4.5,SweetGreenTangerine,"Where do I start with this book?  Okay, let's start with Jojo Moyes.  There is something in the way she tells a story that grabs you.  No gimmicks, fancy tricks or corny cliffhangers.  She just tells the story, not a letter or punctuation wasted or out of place.  I find her writing so easy to read without being easy reading, if you catch the difference there.  She's an artist.




I know I should share a synopsis here, but I don't think I could do it justice.  Besides, I didn't read the synopsis before picking it up and I found it to be a more wholesome experience because of it.  All you need to know is that it's a story about the strength of love and the passionate spirit.




This is the second novel of hers that I have read and I sing from the mountaintops once again, her CHARACTERS.  There is nothing amazingly different about her characters.  They are not scrupulously unique or interesting, but the way she writes them, I believe them. I believe them so much, I care about them.  They are not perfect and it's their blunders, mistakes and straight-up foolishness that irritate me to no end, but I still believe them.  Some characters do stupid things in novels, and I get angry at the author for it.  Moyes' characters do the most infuriating things and I get mad at them for it.  There is a major difference there, and it's what makes characters worth reading. 




This plot is a lot thicker and more action-packed than Me Before You.  But when Moyes is writing, as I said in my Me Before You review, the plot is not what carries you through, it's the characters.
The story is split into two parts that intersect through time.  I admit, I enjoyed the first part most and was a little disappointed when the story shifted away from that character.  However, the story comes back around and everything was worth the wait.  It's a rather interesting turn of events that I did not see coming.  At moments, I thought I just could not bear the intensity of what she put her characters through, but I feel like a changed person after reading it.  Big fat sigh. 




On a personal level, I felt so connected to the character Sophie.  She was one of the most complex and beautiful female characters I have read in a long time.  What happens during Sophie's time is not perfect.  There were moments I could barely stand it.  Then, there were tears, so many tears. 




Read this book.  If you love history, and even if you don't.  If you love art, and even if you don't.  If you love love, and even if you don't.  You will."

Once you pick it up it's hard to put down and i think it's even better than the first book. The way the author writes makes you feel like you're part of the story. Robin Hobb is truly amazing. I think five stars is not enough for this book
1018,"Royal Assassin (Farseer Trilogy, #2)",0006480101,Robin Hobb,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"This is my favorite book in the wonderful and enthralling Farseer trilogy! Robin Hobb creates a brilliantly dark and wild tale of treachery, adventure, and utter sorrow. The world she spins around you will have you seething with rage when Fitz does, and feeling light-headed when  you pull your head out the mystical waters of the Farseer world. Although this trilogy is marketed as an adults series, I'm thirteen and it is my favorite fantasy series, so if you are looking to buy this for your teen, buy it (there's no graphic sex or anything, and there isn't any horribly disturbing violence)! You will not regret it!"

1019,Childhood's End,0345347951,Arthur C. Clarke,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Stevey,"Childhood's End is my third favorite of Clarke's fiction books behind Rama and 2001. What I think makes Childhood's End and the rest of Clarke's books so great is not only the picture he paints in the reader's head, but also how he can make the reader think deeply about the role of humanity in the Universe. I actually do not like most science fiction because many have no themes or messages behind them, making the book simply an imaginative image with no purpose, but Clarke's books are an exception.The Overlord ships may remind you of the ships from Independence Day or a few other movies that consist of aliens coming to Earth and stationing themselves over the major cities. But keep in mind, at the time it was written, none of these movies existed, making this book entirely original.  The book is split into three parts, the first and the last seem more exciting. It spans over a long period of time, more than 50 years, making character development a little rushed in its 240 pages. I like the quote on the back of the book, ""will the Overlords spell the end of humankind...or the beginning."" because that is really what Clarke tries to get readers to think about. The book is a must-read for anyone who has enjoyed any of Clarke's other works, and hopefully a mind-expanding read for people who have not yet been exposed to any of Clarke's work."
1019,Childhood's End,0345347951,Arthur C. Clarke,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"This is one of the best science fiction stories I have ever read. The story is told as a mystery, which slowly unravels as it progresses. I couldn't stop reading it once I had started. The story offers an alternate view on the progression of mankind. The style is similar to the movie 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' in that the characters are trying to find out what's going on, and with an ending which satisfies the wait."
1019,Childhood's End,0345347951,Arthur C. Clarke,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"If you have seen the movie Armagedon you will recognize the beginning of this book and the short story that preceeded it, are almost identical to the beginning of the movie. As I sat in the movie theater I was shocked, and asked myself if Arthur C. Clarke got any credit for the inspiration of the movie. It is a good book, and it will make you think, 'What would I do?'."

I'm 16, and this book has helped me through so much I can't even begin to explain... All I can say is if you've ever felt alone, if you've ever felt those walls, if you've ever felt like no one will understand, then maybe, just maybe, a certain little Despereaux Tilling will raise his sewing needle and tell you a story. All you have to do is listen, dear Listener. And you will know."

It is a key component to a more sustainable and responsible future, to living more in sync with our planet.

Houser",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"The delightful three person voice of this book can not hide the alarm it sounds for those Americans who eat, prepare or otherwise relate to food.  It is a poignant rendering of the brainwashing of Americans in relationship with what they put into their bodies.  In gentle tones the warning comes in side bar fashion along with hope, a plan to make positive changes for good healthy eating and is seasoned with some yummy recipes, too. It was an eye opening and life changing read. This book is a gift for anyone who eats and wants to be healthy."

I am the oldest of 10 and not all of us experienced the farm the same way.  The youngest sibling taught me about 'range eggs' when I was 50 something.  Learned that range eggs are the only kind we knew existed.  Of what Barbara Kingsolver writes is the life we lived in south central North Dakota.  We never had money but we worked sun up to sun down and beyond, chickens and roosters were all around and cows and horses were a part of daily life.  We were never hungry but learned how to weed a garden and long rows of baby trees when we were 3 feet tall.  'To the reviewer who rated the book one star, all I can say is that if you want the good things you gotta work awfully hard --  money or rich or poor is not the limiting factor, only your work ethic'.  The author has enlightened me about a few things such as the information about the rooster and chickens.  I am about 75% finished reading and don't want the book to end.  It will make fabulous Christmas gifts!"

 Just know that Heir of Fire was amazing. 

Ah-freaking-mazing

Have you ever read a series that came alive when you started reading? I love the characters and all of their interactions. The banter back and forth, the great fighting and training scenes, etc. Not once was I upset or disappointed in the story line or the writing. 

I highly recommend this series to anyone that reads. I am a 34 year old mother of three and I savored every page. 
Have you ever read a story and you want to read it quickly because it is so good and you must know what happens next?  But then need to slowdown because the epic journey is almost over and you are not ready for the end? That is HoF. I just finished and I am going back to page 1 and doing a re-read! 

This series has been magical and entertaining since the very first page of Throne of Glass. 

5 stars for this wonderful installment. I will be eagerly waiting for the next to see what the future holds for Rowan, Dorian, Choal, Aedin, Caelina, Aelin, Fleetfoot, and everyone else. Long live the Queen."
1022,"Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass, #3)",1619630656,Sarah J. Maas,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Sailon,"Heir of Fire is one of the best books I've ever read. If you know me and how many books I've read...yes, that is truly saying something. Some books take you on a journey but the Best books pull you into the journey making it an adventure you will never forget. Heir of Fire is just such a book! With Sarah Maas's writing you can't help but become a part of the story!




I could go on and on about the story but I won't, I don't want to give anything away. What I will say is just when you thought you had Celaena all figured out, BAM her character development explodes into magnificence. She is the ultimate badass but now that her true identity is revealed...Holy Crap, I was white knuckle reading.




Throne of Glass is sure to be one of the few series that I will re-read, time and time again. Don't miss this epic fantasy with one of the most unforgettable heroines, nail biting action and amazing, shocking, plot twists that will leave you with the biggest book hangover ever."
1022,"Heir of Fire (Throne of Glass, #3)",1619630656,Sarah J. Maas,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Anonymous,"Even though Barnes and Nobles lists The Heir Of Fire as the last book of the series it is not. Sarah J. Mass's contract requires her to write 6 books on the series Throne Of Glass. Thats right. We're only halfway done with this amazing series. I was down right terrified when I had 10 pages of the book left and thought the books would end here but we have nothing to fear. Even though it might take a decade for this amazing author to finish her stories she started writing as a teenager, I will gladly wait for the finished series."

1023,"Lord of Chaos (Wheel of Time, #6)",0812513754,Robert Jordan,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"One of Jordan's amazing atributes is the ability to whisk you away to another world.    If you want to go. If you're not big into fantasy, you'll die reading these books, out of simple bordom.    Personally, I love fantasy. When I started reading Wheel of Time, it was hard to read one, and unthinkable to read another after it--it burned me out, and I never thought I could re-read these books.    I could re-read Lord of Chaos. Simply put, this book was the best of all the series up to this point. It's gotten some flack simply because people don't really have any taste. Robert Jordan only proves his worth with this book.     This book is probably the largest of the entire series, but I'm not complaining--there's only more to enjoy."

1029,"Saga, Vol. 1 (Saga, #1)",1607066017,"Brian K. Vaughan, Fiona Staples",Barnes and Noble,4.7,Candace-LoveyDoveyBooks,"Saga, Volume 1 is a collection of the first six stories in the Saga series. Brian K. Vaughan&rsquo;s brilliant storytelling, backed up by the bold artistry of Fiona Staples, offers adult readers an entertaining and impressive graphic novel. As the drama unfolds, Vaughan&rsquo;s fans will come to appreciate the depth of the plot and the well-rounded characters that take us on a journey bursting with unexpected twists and outcomes.

Alana and Marko&rsquo;s story feels like it could have been adapted from a hardcore, science-fiction version of Shakespeare&rsquo;s Romeo and Juliet. Alana and Marko are each from the opposing sides in an outrageous war that&rsquo;s expanded across the universe. Saga opens with the birth of their mixed-breed daughter; with wings from her mother and horns from her father. Aside from the opening scenes, the story is already taking a direction that show how far from ordinary it&rsquo;ll be. The narration sounds like it might be a third person omniscient point of view from someone with no ties to the main characters, but in reality, the narration is that of someone who is right in the middle of all the action. Hazel tells us the story of her birth and guides readers through the history of Alana and Marko&rsquo;s world. It was quite a surprise to recognize who the speaker is, but she bridges the story&rsquo;s subplots together so that the end result is smooth and tinged with chilling forewarning.

An enormous reason why Saga drags you in and keeps you reading is because Vaughan creates a versatile dialogue. The dialogue captures each character&rsquo;s personality well, whether they fall along the lines of sarcastic, hateful, or pleasant. The illustrations were drawn with no limits so you never know what you might see next, but even Staples captures the danger, the tense moments, and character reactions impeccably. The characters&rsquo; body language is very well in sync with their thoughts that sometimes you may not even need thought bubbles to get the sense of their next move.

Saga is a story strictly written with an adult audience in mind. The language, the nude scenes and how the violence is depicted do not make for a story suitable for teens and younger. I thought the violence was slightly icky because you actually see the effect of someone being struck and afterwards when they&rsquo;re fatally injured, but it didn&rsquo;t completely turn me off from the story itself. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend Saga to the more reserved readers or those who are relatively squeamish.

Saga continues soon in Saga #7, and I&rsquo;m so eager to see what awaits Alana and Marko. Brian K. Vaughan and Fiona Staples have created a dynamic series that will definitely come as a surprise and entertaining treat to readers!

Well, after reading the first collection of Saga I realize it doesn&rsquo;t matter what I think, BKV is amazing.  Saga is pure unfettered imagination.  A truly original idea book that can literally go anywhere.  He creates a world(s) that is easy to understand by frighteningly odd.  This was a such a strange book, but in a good way.  Fiona Staples does a phenomenal job of crafting a weirdly beautiful world of aliens, robots, and so much more.

I found the story being told from so many points of view hard to follow.  Maybe it was because I couldn't make myself care about the characters enough to keep track of who was talking.  I thought the co dependent relationship between Henry and Schwartz got old.  I also found the relationship between Owen and the university president totally unbelievable.  Gay or straight, a relationship between a 20 something athlete and a 60 something university president ......please.  One last thing,I thought it was rediculous how many times in the book someone mentioned how pretty Pella's name was.  Seriously, every time I read her name I thought of windows.  I really expected a New York Times Best Seller to be more engaging."

I find it difficult to believe that this is Chad Harbach's first published book. You do not need to know anything about baseball to read and enjoy ""The Art of Fielding."" I do know a little more than nothing about baseball, and the pace was maintained throughout. I liked all the characters, and loved a few. Henry is a cousin of Holden Caulfield, in my opinion. Yes, I would suggest this to reading groups, and as soon as it is in paperback (a rule of the reading group I am in,) I am going to recommend that we read this wonderful book. I happen to live in a small college town in Ohio, and almost all of the college aspects rang true. I am awaiting more writing from Chad Harbach."

1032,"Fablehaven (Fablehaven, #1)",1590385810,Brandon Mull,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Lindsey_Miller,"All to often with fantasy books written within the past 20 years or so, it's just a rehashing of the exact same ideas and same fantasy tropes and mythological creatures. Child of promise has special powers that enable him or her to take on the great evil presence that has oppressed the entire world. Throw in some elves, dwarves, dragons, vampires, etc and you've got yourself a story.

In many respects, that was what I was expecting out of Fablehaven. Even just the name makes it seem like we're in for the exact same sort of plot structure and fantasy world. However, even though Mull hasn't created any sort of new fantasy or mythological creatures, his take on how the world has come to be and the rules that have been placed onto it are refreshingly new. 

Also, Mull is a good enough writer that he doesn't just rely on the typical fantasy plot or limited growth in main characters, but instead creates characters who are complex and through their personalities cause many of the issues that they then need to resolve. The story is more about discovery and personal growth, understanding boundaries and the consequences of breaking those boundaries than it is about mythical creatures.

Not quite a rival for a Rowling world, Fablehaven is still engaging, and will captivate readers in a unique way. I recommend this series to readers 10-14.

1032,"Fablehaven (Fablehaven, #1)",1590385810,Brandon Mull,Barnes and Noble,4.6,TeensReadToo,"It's very rare, in this day and age of Harry Potter mania (and yes, I admit I'm a very devoted victim!) to find a fantasy story that can actually hold your attention. With FABLEHAVEN, though, new author Brandon Mull manages to do just that from the very first page to the last. Not to mention, thank the fairies, that there's already another book planned in the series. The premise is simple enough: two siblings, thirteen-year-old Kendra and her eleven-year-old brother, Seth, are relegated to spending time with their paternal grandparents, Grandma and Grandpa Sorenson, while their parents enjoy a seventeen-day Scandinavian cruise. At first glance, that might not seem so strange, but you have to understand that their family's relationship with the grandparents Sorenson is sort of an odd one. They don't visit much, they don't call; in fact, Kendra and Seth don't really know their grandparents that well at all. This is a forced, mandatory vacation though, so the kids don't have much choice in the matter. And when they finally reach Fablehaven, where, unbeknown to them, their Grandfather is the caretaker, they're a little overwhelmed. First, there were the No Trespassing and Private Property signs that gave way to one that said Certain Death Awaits. Now, they find out that however pretty and secluded Fablehaven may be, there's no television, no radio, and a ton of rules -- not all of which make sense. What follows is two weeks of more adventure, trouble, suspense, and magic than the kids could have ever dreamed of. When their rash actions, and disobedience to some important rules, leads to retribution from the magical world of Fablehaven, Kendra, Seth, Grandpa Sorenson, and even Grandma, who seems to be missing, are in for a ride. FABLEHAVEN is a great fantasy novel perfect for everyone, from young adults to those young at heart. With a cast of characters ranging from witches to fairies, satyrs to imps, strange chickens and conniving trolls, there's definitely something for everyone. I plan to give my copy of FABLEHAVEN to my ten-year-old son to read next, and I'm pretty sure he'll enjoy it as much as I did (not to mention my mom, who gets it when he's done!). Kudos to Mr. Mull for such a great debut fantasy novel, and for giving me something absolutely wonderful to read during my Harry Potter-deprived winter. I can't wait for the next book in the series!"

I'm on the fifth one right now, but this one has so far been my favorite!!  The action never seemed to stop and it was nearly impossible to put it down, and when you're a college student with upcoming tests it can make things difficult.The characters were great and the plot really kept you guessing.  The great thing about the Dresden Files is that pretty much any of the books can stand alone and so if you were to only pick one to read, so far it should be this one!  Highly recommend it!!"
1034,"Grave Peril (The Dresden Files, #3)",0451458443,Jim Butcher,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"The Dresden Files is officially one of my favorite series. If books one and two would not have hooked me (which they did), this one definitely would did the job. What I love about Harry is that he just thinks he's this average guy, er...wizard. But, truthfully, there is nothing average about him. Harry is the kind of guy you want on your side no matter what, whether going up against humans or ghosts or vampires or...anything. He is just a nice guy, and he always does the right thing. 

I love the world building Butcher created in this series. It is so utterly complex, with every mystical, magical creature having their own community, their own set of rules. This book deals mostly with ghosts and vampires. In the beginning Harry is chasing ghosts, only to find they've been tied to the vampires somehow. Of course, it all comes back to Bianca, who you will remember if you've read the first to in the books in the series.

How this book ended...wow. I really did not see it coming. I cannot say too much without giving anything away, but we get to see more of the softer side of Harry that was hinted at in the last book. These books will never be labeled as romance, but the way Butcher was able to pen in the little bit of Harry and Susan is pretty special. 

I listened to the audio of Grave Peril. I think I've said it before, but here it is again: James Marsters makes an amazingly wonderful Harry. I really wish he would have read all the books in this series."

1035,Einstein: His Life and Universe,0743264738,Walter Isaacson,Barnes and Noble,4.2,frankDeHouston,"I learned more about Einstein from this one book than with all the previous articles, papers, hear-say, etc. floating around in the printed world.  Excellent writing style to boot!  I am listening to it while driving and sometimes on arriving to my destination I just sit there in the parking lot engrossed in the story."
1035,Einstein: His Life and Universe,0743264738,Walter Isaacson,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"Albert Einstein is generally considered one of the greatest   scientists of the 20th century. It is not often, though, that   people understand him as the active pacifist that he was.   Isaacson introduces Einstein in a new light - as both a   funny and  innovative idealist. Though dense at times, the   book carefully balances theory with humanity and moves   smoothly through Einstein's complicated ideas. We   understand the inner workings of Einstein's mind - both   his social insecurities as well as his humor. By the end of   the biography, you feel as though you are saying goodbye   to a dear friend. The book offers the reader a glimpse into   the life of this famous mind, allowing the general person   to understand both his science and his soul."
1035,Einstein: His Life and Universe,0743264738,Walter Isaacson,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"The creator of the Queen of all equations, without a doubt the most famous equation on our planet, the one propounding the equivalence of Energy to mass multiplied by the square of the speed of light, a universal constant, has now been dissected once again, this time by the well-known biographer, Walter Isaacson.    In this sprawling, captivating, most readable biography, the author has drawn a well-balanced, multi-layered portrait of Einstein.     It is quite possible that growing up slowly has its advantages. In his early childhood Einstein was a slow learner. He learned to speak only after the age of two. And because of his slow verbal development, ¿he thought that it allowed him to observe with wonder the everyday phenomena that others took for granted. Instead of puzzling over mysterious things, he puzzled over the commonplace,¿ the author has written.    Walter Isaacson states that Einstein once explained how he happened to discover the theory of relativity: ¿The ordinary adult never bothers his head about the problems of space and time. These are things he has thought of as a child. But I developed so slowly that I began to wonder about space and time only when I was already grown up. Consequently, I probed more deeply into the problem than an ordinary child would have.'    I was not surprised to read that even thought his parents were irreligious, Einstein himself believed in God, a ¿God who reveals Himself in the harmony of all that exists'.  Not all scientists are atheists, of course. He saw no contradiction between science and religion. 'The religious inclination lies in the dim consciousness that dwells in humans that all nature, including the humans in it, is in no way an accidental game, but a work of lawfulness that there is a fundamental cause of all existence,' he has said.      When I hear the name Einstein, I think of the bust of Einstein I saw in a museum when I was six years old. The bust, sculpted of fine white marble and placed on a black marble pedestal, was given a prominent place in the museum hall. After reading Walter Isaacson¿s biography of Einstein, I felt as if the author had transformed the cold marble sculpture into a warm and beautiful statue of clay, and relocated it from its glistening pedestal to a pedestal of molded clay, fired to brick-red in a kiln. Now grainy and highly textured and stripped of its halo and made to look earthy and human, the formidable bust suddenly looks more inviting, approachable and, in an odd way, even likable.      With the aid of newly released personal letters and archival documents that were unavailable to biographers before, Isaacson has written a charming and impressive biography, as unexpected and startling as the discovery of a previously unknown type of bright and succulent fruit growing on a prickly plant.     What better way to conclude this brief review than with the words of Einstein himself: ¿Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.'  What clearly comes through while reading this book is the notion that Einstein not only had a brilliant mind, and sharp intellect, but he also had a weird sense of humor, and at times lacked social grace as well. But I must say that this book has won me over."

However, I must say that I enjoyed Thoughtless much more than I did Effortless, and what saved Effortless for me was the ending.  The ending of the book was fabulous and made me grateful that I pushed through.  My major complaint is that Kiera was not a likeable character.  I found her to be extremely annoying and way too insecure.  I was annoyed at the fact that Kellan was being treated by Kiera as though he was the one who cheated on her, when in reality it was the reverse.  Kellan always gave Kiera exactly what she wanted, but yet he was always the bad guy.  Yes, Kellan may have been with a lot of women, and no one wants to keep running into women that their boyfriend has been with, but Kiera behaved as though Kellan was not a single guy when he was &quot;dating&quot; these women, but instead had cheated on her.  When in reality it was Kiera who was the one with the history of cheating.  Yet, Kellan, knowing how insecure Kiera is when her boyfriend leaves, did all of these sweet and wonderful things for her to let her know that she was in his heart and always in his mind, but yet it wasn't enough for Kiera and her insecurities.  Kiera overreacted to just about everything.  It was so very annoying.  Yes, Kellan should have told her about the phone calls, but her decision to not tell him about Denny far outweighed Kellan not telling her about some phone calls.  I wanted to read more about the rest of the D-Bags and their girlfriends.  There was just way too much of Kiera and her thought-processing, which was very annoying, circular and delusional."
1037,The Street Lawyer,0385339097,John Grisham,Barnes and Noble,4,Johnkeegan93,"In the book, The Street Lawyer, John Grisham pulls us threw the wild adventure that was the main character Michael Brock's last year at the prestigious law-firm of Drake & Sweeny.  Michael was a hot shot lawyer in a huge D.C. firm.  The money was good, and getting better due to the fact of a coming partnership opportunity.  

But when a mysterious, and homeless, individual calling himself Mister, enters the firm and start to follow Michael up to the Drake & Sweeny floors, things start to go south for the new lawyer.  After cornering many of the managing partners and Michael in a upstairs office, he pulls a gun and tells begins to grill each of them about the greed and lack of donations to the poor by them.  After a SWAT team takes down Mister, Michael starts to lose it.  

After a large downward spiral and a lot of life changing items, Michael falls upon 14th Street Legal Clinic.  The Clinic was established as a free lawyer operation serving the poor.  Hard ball lawyer Mordecai Green was Michael's new mentor in the art of Street Law.

The book was amazing, and one of the best Grisham books I've ever read.  He expertly portrays the hard and fast life of a lawyer already stretched thin.  The best part of the storyline is how he incorporates the normal aspects into the already crazy aspects of life.  

Already involved with the near death involving Mister, Michael loses his wife, his car, his apartment and the love of his family.  Many of people ask him why did he do it?  Why give up all the money and power of a big shot lawyer.  Michael ends up with a new life and new love, and most importantly, happiness.

1038,"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry (Logans, #4)",014034893X,Mildred D. Taylor,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"Roll of Thunder, Hear my Cry is about a black family living in Mississippi  during the early 1930's. This family, like many other families, is suffering from the unfair treatment from the whites. Their land is the only thing that gives them power. This is a good book for anyone that's wanting to learn more about the segragation issue, or even the unfair treatment of the blacks. This is also a true story, so it has lots of facts about the time period. I really liked this book. It kept me on the edge of my seat most of the time. The book is based on true events that happened to the author, Mildred d. Taylor. The character's names were changed. The author was born in Mississippi (the same location the story takes place in), and her father worked on the railroad (the same one in the story). I judged the book by three things, suspence, the events in the story, and the ending. The story had suspence, and the events and ending were great. The main point of the book was to give the readers an idea of what it was like to live in the deep south during the 1930's. The book really does give you an idea of what it was like.Cassie, the stories main character, is always trying to stand up for herself against the whites, and is brave. Stacey is Cassie's older brother, and is almost like Cassie. He's brave and trys to stand up for himself. Christopher- John is one of Cassie's younger brothers, and is trys to avoid trouble when ever possible, but still gets dragged into what Stacey wants to do. Little Man is the youngest, and he trys to be brave, but is still too young to stand up for himself. The book definitely achieves its goals and purposes. Its gives the readers an idea of what it was like living in the 1930's, and it gives us a good, suspenceful story. This book is like no other non-fiction story I've read, because its built like a fictional story, but acually has true events.I really liked this book. It kept me on the edge of my seat most of the time. It had many sad moments, and some funny ones too. I recammend this book to anyone and I give it 5 stars."

A mysterious plague has befallen Regency England killing the living and reviving them back to life as the undead who must feed on the living to survive. The conflict in town is fierce, spreading to the countryside and into the village of Meryton where Elizabeth Bennet and her family reside nearby at Longbourn. Mr. Bennet extricated from his library has dedicated himself instead to training his five daughters from an early age in the deadly arts, traveling with them to China to attend Ninja finishing school with a Shaolin Master. His business in life was to keep them alive. The business of Mrs. Bennet's was to get them married. When Netherfield Park is let at last, Mrs. Bennet is hopeful that the new resident Mr. Bingley and his friends might marry one or another of her daughters. When Meryton society finally meets Mr. Bingley, they agree that he is was good-looking and gentlemanlike, but his fine friend Mr. Darcy with his noble mien gave immediate disgust even though he was reputed to have slaughtered more than a thousand unmentionables since the fall of Cambridge. After he slights Elizabeth, claiming her to be only tolerable and not handsome enough to temp him to dance, the warrior code in her demands she avenge her honour and open his throat with her dagger. Her warrior duty delays her instincts as the dance is suddenly invaded by a maraudring horde of unmentionables who break through the windows, attack the guests, and devour the head of Mrs. Long. Elizabeth and her four sisters rip out their razor-sharp daggers and make short work of beheading all the sorry stricken. Darcy watches in wonder, knowing of only one other woman in England that who could match her skill, her grace and precision. The spark has been ignited. The love, *cough* zombie story begins.

It is now ""a truth universally acknowledged that a zombie in possession of brains must be in want of more brains."" We continue along in this manner following Jane Austen's plot interjected with Grahame-Smith's fanciful parody of zombie bedlam. If the concept of Jane Austen's refined country gentry and gory zombie destruction are in conflict, think again. Like the warrior Bennet sisters who have refined their deadly skills into an art of precision and style, Grahame-Smith knows his zombie lore, skillfully incorporating a genre wholly at odds to the context of Jane Austen's elegantly refined prose, yet working within its strengths to achieve his goal to have fun with a literary classic, and well, lets face it, make money. 

So who will like this book? Certainly not the Austen purist without a sense of humor. They will not even get past the gruesome cover. Not zombie fans, who will be annoyed having to trudge through a masterpiece of world literature to get to the scant zombie action. So that leaves the rest of us. Those loyal and devoted members of The Gentle Reprove and Witty Banter Society who, like Jane Austen, enjoy a good campy and gory Gothic novel, recognize tongue-in-cheek humor, and have been happily doing so for over 200 hundred years.

1039,"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies (Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, #1)",1594743347,"Seth Grahame-Smith, Jane Austen",Barnes and Noble,3.6,Hokie4VT,"I really, really wanted to like this book.  I love zombie movies and Jane Austen and this book actually could have been really good.  However, it suffers from some major downfalls, the two most grievous being an extreme lack of realism (for the context, don't get me wrong) and poor writing (not on Jane Austen's part).

My main problem was all the ridiculous nonsense about ninjas and dojos.  I mean, come on.  It is certainly believable that the sisters would have learned different fighting arts but traveling to the ""Orient"" and studying with martial arts masters?  I doubt very seriously if they could have afforded to travel to China and it would have been much more realistic to have focused on European fighting methods.  And the ridiculous ""bloodlust"" of Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy was completely out of character.  Whoever said the characters remained true to Austen doesn't understand the characters.  I couldn't get over the scene where Elizabeth kills three of Lady Catherine's ninjas and then eats part of one of their hearts.  

The other major problem was the writing and editing.  If you are going to try and follow another writer's style then you'd better get it right.  It was painfully obvious that the author wasn't up to the task and that his editor couldn't catch his numerous mistakes.  I haven't seen a book so poorly edited in quite some time.  

I think this book could have been really excellent with a different author who isn't obsessed with ninjas.  Honestly, it was like Kill Bill added to Jane Austen which if you like that movie, you might like this book.  If they do make this into a movie, I hope they leave out all the ninja garbage and keep the characters true to who they are instead of modeling them after Uma Thurman in a Quentin Tarantino film.  This book just had me wishing for the original."

I started reading it and got confused what century it was suppose to be in. It sounded like Jane Austen at some points then sounded modern and crude at others. Then I looked at the additional author on this book and he only took one class in english literature. I was shocked they let someone unqualified to touch this great novel. He uses modern slang such as Darcy joking that Elizabeth has his balls. Ugh! People didn't talk like that then! There is a disconnect between the Jane Austene parts and the new writer's. Apparently life continues the same even though the dead walk and all the characters have great fighting skills; doesn't seem rational to me. I don't advise anyone to buy this if you truly enjoyed the original novel. You will just be disappointed. It is just a mockery of the great novel, Pride and Prejudice."

The most fundamental theme of all of his major works that I've read, including Notes from Underground, Crime and Punishment, The Idiot, and even The Brothers Karamazov (though in a much more subtle and sophisticated form) is that reason and the intellect are corrupting and one should instead be guided by faith and feelings. But Dostoevsky is easier to stomach because his feelings are relatively humanitarian, compared to Tolstoy's obscene misanthropy and misogyny. And for an artistic vision of why Christian morality is utterly impracticable, this is probably the greatest novel ever written...Christlike Prince Myshkin's fate is as inevitable as it is horrifying."

I have read all of the ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Universe"" series and the ""Dirk Gently"" books are a great addition to the works of Douglas Adams. The characters in this book had whimsical moments, but those moments were balanced with the scientific detail in various events. The mysteriousness of the plot was intriguing and thought-provoking. Speaking of which, the storyline was one of utmost originality. Time machines, ghosts, and an electric monk wrapped up in one neat package. Science fiction and humor are mixed flawlessly together in ""Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency."""

Once you read this book you will learn that you're not out there alone. There are other people that go through the same thing. After you read this book you learn that you're not alone so never feel like you are. 
   This book is great for kids. Its great for anybody to read. I encourage teachers to introduce this book to their students because its funny, absorbing, amusing, thrilling, and teaches kids life lessons they need to learn. READ THE BOOK MAN!!! YOU WON'T WANT TO PUT IT DOWN!!!"
1043,"Rodrick Rules (Diary of a Wimpy Kid, #2)",0810994739,Jeff Kinney,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"The story I am doing my book report on is Diary of a Wimpy Kid Rodrik Rules. This was written by Kinney Jeff. The main characters in this book are Rodrik, Greg, Manny, and Rowley. Let's start with Rodrik. Rodrik is Greg's brother and he is really mean to Greg. He also has a band and I guess their dad thinks they are not very good. Rodrik is the bad child in the house because he doesn't follow the rules and he doesn't give respect to his parents. In this book Rodrik is the protagonist. Next is Greg. Greg is the main character in this book. He is also one of the antagonists. Greg is kind of wimpy but nice. He is the one who doesn't do something bad but gets framed for doing it. Like his brother Rodrik always blames it on Greg or Greg just gets in trouble. At school Greg has one friend and he is Rowley. Manny is next. Manny is Greg's and Rodriks little brother. Manny is the tattletale in this book. When he sees Greg do something bad he tells their mom. But some how that never happens with Rodrik. Manny is also one of the antagonists. He is nice too. Manny is my favorite character because he can't talk very well. He says things like ""Greg bwoke the window"". Rowley is next. Rowley is Greg's best friend. He is very nice and weird. Rowley visits a lot of places around the world. Usually when Rowley comes back from a new country he gets hooked onto what's hot there. He lives with his mom and dad. He loves to play video games with Greg and they have a lot of sleepovers. Rowley is another antagonist. These were all the main characters. The plot of the story is that Rodrik is always being a jerk to Greg and Greg always tries to tell on him. But then Rodrik always says he'll tell everybody what happened to Greg in summer. It is also about Greg trying to get many in trouble but like always Greg is the one to get in trouble. In this story Rodrik got in trouble a couple of tomes but not all the time. Manny is the one who causes the most trouble but never gets in trouble for it. This was the plot of the story. This story probably takes place in the present day. It takes place at Greg's school and at his house. The theme of this story is to respect your parents and love and cherish what they offer you. I liked this story because I can relate to Greg and how he feels sometimes in this book. Like when his brother Rodrik is tormenting him. One connection I had in this book is to me. I connect to this book because I have an older brother and he torments me a lot too just like Greg and Rodrik. Another connection I have to this book is to the world. This connects to the world because I'm probably not the only person who has a brother or sister that torments them. A couple related books I've read are Diary of a Wimpy Kid the Last Straw and Diary of a Wimpy Kid Dog Days. Thank you for reading my book report."

Junger did an excellent job in getting most of the details right. He told it like it was.

I served aboard the Coast Guard Cutter Tamaroa (the cutter that rescued most of the Air National Guard helecopter crew) starting shortly after this event took place, I knew many of the key players ivolved in all that took place. I have met many others that were involved as well. (The Tam's decommissioning ceremony was a very emotional event in 1994).

If you're looking for an acturate portrailal of what could and sometimes does happen on the open sea, this is a good book for you. It's also good for those who have ever wondered about what the U.S Coast Guard and the Air National Guard deal with on a daily basis.

This story of ""gods"" brought low is quite gripping, leaving the reader on the edge of his or her seat. The story of the Elantrans, and their once great race and city, is very deep, with a plot that has more twists and turns than a hedge maze. A prince deeply loved by his people, shows the signs of the changing, pronounced dead, and thrown in the old city of Elantris with the rest of these immortal beings. His betrothed arrives at the palace only to find that he has ""died,"" yet the story she is told seems not to fit with what she sees. A priest of the most powerful religion in the world sees the fall of Elantris as a sign that his religion is the one true path...or is it?

1049,"Elantris (Elantris, #1)",0765350378,Brandon Sanderson,Barnes and Noble,4.4,songbirdsue,"I really enjoyed this book. I found the time and world fascinating. It was amazing to think of an arranged marriage princess bride arriving to her new land to find out that her intended was dead and she was married to him, thus a widow never having met him in person. I have to admit that I have never met a character who came so close and yet had such a hard time getting married.

I marvel how both the Princess and Prince created their own realms similarly yet apart. You want so badly for them to get together because you know that they would be good together.

I love how the Prince pieces together the puzzle and comes to really love the Princess. He was so good at changing everyone in Elantris by giving them a job to do, a purpose. It really helps you appreciate our need for purpose in our lives. I was fascinated by the science involved in Elantris.

It is hard to keep track of all of the characters especially because they sometimes have similar sounding names. There are a ton of characters to keep track of too.

I found the priests involvement in the story disturbing at times but also intriguing.

I do like how it ends."

I thought the whole premise of the story was very original and fascinating.  My only complaint about the book is that the main characters are female - who despite the author's attempts - are unlike any women I have ever met.  They think like men, have sex like men, process violence and sexual assault like only a man could, etc.  I read this book with my bookclub - all female - and our opinion was unaminous that only a man would think that gang-raping a woman would ""tame"" her.

1052,Handle with Care,0743296419,Jodi Picoult,Barnes and Noble,4,TheLitChick,"As a person with multiple disabilities--a ""disabled person""--I have so much more respect for authors who tell it like it is, rather than glossing over the realities. I *am* dependant on my mother: at 24, I live in her house, paying no rent and contributing nothing financially to the household, and that situation is likely to stay that way for the foreseeable future. Even if I eventually get ""out on my own"" it'll likely be on her dollar; full independence is not something I expect ever to have. I'm also a burden to her, financially, of course, but also emotionally: I get hospitalized at least once a year--which is hard for her both because she's scared for me, and because she nearly kills herself trying to be there for me while working and taking care of her elderly mother--and also, I know that she hurts every time there's something I want to do that I can't. Whether it's going to school, or working, or even going out with friends, when I fail, it hurts my mom like I don't think anything else can. I know this. A person, even a child, knows these things, even if no one uses specific words to describe them.

That's why I applaud Ms. Picoult for writing stories that take place in the real world, in my real world. I'm sick of books where, at the end, the new treatment is found, or the child miraculously recovers. I'm sure it happens sometimes, and that's great, but it doesn't ring true to me. I want to read about people I can relate to. Would my mother have aborted me if she'd know what I was going to be like? I don't know. But I do know that she hurts for me every day, and that if someone told her she'd give birth to a child who suffered as I do, she would have thought long and hard about her options. That doesn't mean she doesn't love me. It means she loves me enough to hate how much I hurt. The idea of a mother, going to court to get money to help her child...my mom's not rich. And it is a huge struggle for her to pay for my care. If there was someone who could have told her I'd suffer this way 25 years ago...this book is real. It's about real people, real questions, and real struggles. You don't have to like it. But don't tell me what disabled people think, or feel, and don't tell me that Ms. Picoult's book, rather than your narrow-minded opinions, hurt me.

By the way: for someone so concerned with what ""disabled people"" think and feel: we mostly stopped calling ourselves that years ago. Just for your information."
1052,Handle with Care,0743296419,Jodi Picoult,Barnes and Noble,4,Lennonthegreat,"I agree with everyone else.  The lady that wants the book banned is living in some sort of 3rd dimension.  Jodi Picoult has and probably always will, write about controversial subjects.  What sets her apart from others is that she does so with such brilliance and subtlety.  She is one of the finest writers of our time.  If someone doesn't like a book, what they need to do is, close it and pick up another that they don't ""disagree"" with.  It is narrow mindedness like this that stunts emotional and intelligent growth."

My brother has autism and mental retardation, and quite honestly, I find this book to hit close to home, in a good way. Because when you really think about it, I would give anything for my brother to live a normal, happy, full health life, but in no way does Ms. Picoult's writing influence how I feel about him. I know you are just stating your opinion, but remember, hers are just opinions as well. Just because she comes out with this book does not mean it will influence how other people feel about their child. And I find your use of the world ""disabled"" insulting. My brother is not disabled. He does the same things you and I do everyday, even with all the problems he has. Disabled means something is stopping you. Nothing is stopping my brother from being perfectly happy. I find Jodi Picoult an amazing author knowing exactly how to tug at the heart strings, and how to make tears of joy, release, and pain flow from our hearts through our eyes. Her work is astonishing. I've read quite a few of her books, and they're all controversal, but in a good way. These sorts of things DO happen in today's world, after all."

What ruined it for me was when Stephen King wrote himself into the book.  I was okay with the brief mention in Wolves of the Calla.  It showed King had a sense of humor; however, he went too far in Song of Susannah.  It cheapened the whole story line for me.   Oh well, 3 out of the 6 so far have been great.

Maybe I'm weird, but I read many other reviews that didn't like that King brought himself into the book (probably the same people who complained that he brought in Harry Potter references in the last...), but I loved it. Can a fantasy book really give that surreal feeling? This one did.

Again, I'm having a hard time expressing my feelings about this book because it feels like one of the small pieces in a puzzle. It's starting to fill in some of the picture as a whole but not enough to really give you that ""ah-ha"" moment. It was like the first sip of great hot chocolate. It was delicious but not as good as the next, or the next or the next.

1054,"Reached (Matched, #3)",0525423664,Ally Condie,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Suvorov,"Reached is the third in the Matched trilogy. In this final installment, Condie will answer most of those pesky questions the reader has been asking and explanations to the mysteries of the Society and Rising. Happy days are ahead!     
-----
To be quite honest, I was underwhelmed with the first half of the book; it was slow and I had a difficult time getting into it. I don't know what's going on with some of the authors lately, but there seems to be a lot of unnecessary and boring fluff going around. For example, remember in Crossed when Cassia reads a note from Xander stating he has a secret he wants to tell her in person? Condie drags this out for a long time, even after both Cassia and the reader have figure out what the secret is. Then I started to think there was a huge, surprise revelation in the making because surely the author would not drag out something so insignificant. Prepare yourself for disappointment. Bad editor!     
-----
Then there is the letter Cassia writes to Xander with her own confession. The confession is at the end of the letter, which, of course, is damaged and unreadable. So right when Xander gets to the important part, WHAM- it's gone. I tell you, Ky may have been victimized by the Society, but Xander takes a beating from the writing- the author's that is.     
-----
Things did start to get exciting when Condie finally starts revealing those answers and explanations I mentioned earlier. I have to say, the connection between the Society and Rising is genius, although very Matrix-like. I thought it was awesome and just the right amount creepy.     
-----
Now to the whole Otherlands issue, which always remains mysterious- Does it really exist? Is it so wonderful that no one ever wants to come back, even to tell the others? Or is it all a fantasy and everyone who goes there dies while trying to find it? I could go on with all the possibilities, but I won't. Neither will Condie for that matter. For those of us oldsters, it is very reminiscent of Logan's Run.     
-----
And then the whole love story thing kind of fixes itself a little too easily. Any competition or complication is quickly remedied or killed off. I'm glad Cassia ends up with who she does, but she should suffer a little bit over her decision. Wrapping things up in a nice neat package and giving her an easy out is overly unrealistic. I guess I have to keep in mind that we are talking about a book geared toward teenagers and some authors underestimate the intelligence of this particular audience. I think it does a disservice to young adults to assume they want to end the story with all flowers and bunnies.     
-----
Condie did a really good job of bringing everything together in the end. There were some good &quot;[Luke], I am your father&quot; moments, which makes me wonder how the author does this. Does the author design a flow chart of characters ahead of time and make the story match? Or does the author write the first book with no idea where it is going, the book becomes a huge success and now she has to figure out how to tie everything together? Did she plant a seemingly insignificant detail in the first book with the full intent of using it as a spectacular revelation with far reaching consequences, or was it an afterthought? With a series, I would think there are a lot of pages and time in between books to mess things up, but with Reached, the author really did deliver a believable connection between characters and details in the end.     
-----
Unfortunately, I thought the first part of the final scene was a bit clich&eacute;, especially with what is going on at the time of its release. In addition, Condie leaves room for another sequel or, more likely, a spinoff. Don't be surprised if you see more books come out dealing with rebuilding Society, a new rebellion with Xander as the leader or a freakish Brave New World in the Otherlands. They could work."

1055,Midnight's Children,0099578514,Salman Rushdie,Barnes and Noble,4.1,WWCEBC,"""Midnight's Children"" by Salman Rushdie won the Booker Prize in 1981 and was awarded in 1993 the honor of ""best overall novel"" of all Booker Prize winners since the prize was first awarded in 1975.  In 2005 it made the 100 best English-language novels published since 1923. I agree that it is worthy of such accolades. It is basically a story of India's history immediately before independence from Great Britain and for its beginning years as a nation continuing on to Pakistan separation and ensuing wars between the two nations.  The story is built on and parallels the lives of those children born at midnight on that day of independence, August 15, 1947, at the designated time of independence thus the title, Midnight's Children.  The main character, Saleem Sinai, is one of those children and his life is linked to the 1000 other midnight's children all of whom have some type of magical powers or gifts. It is definitely a challenging and intellectual read, both thought-provoking and complex. I feel more knowledgeable about Indian history and the divisions within that nation that continue even into today's society there.  * * *"
1055,Midnight's Children,0099578514,Salman Rushdie,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"If I wasn't completely convinced before that Salman Rushdie has a claim to be the most gifted writer on the planet, I am after reading this book.     This novel is a generational saga along the lines of Gabriel Garcia-Marquez's 'One Hundred Years of Solitude' and Jeffrey Eugenides's 'Middlesex'. As those two novels reflect the history of their own respective nations, so does 'Midnight's Children.' It is the story of one family, and one person in particular, Saleem, who is born on the stroke of midnight on the exact day and time India achieved its independence from Britain. From that propitious birth onward, Saleem's life becomes a reflection and representation of the young Indian nation itself.     The title refers to the 400 odd children who were born at or near this same midnight. Each one of them have magical skills which vary in strength and importance in direct relation to their birth's proximity to midnight. Since Saleem was born exactly at midnight, he has the most valuable skill, the skill to look into people's hearts, minds, and souls, and to commune with the other midnight children mentally. In this vein, he forms the Midnight Children's Conference, a meeting of these 400+ children who communicate through Saleem's telepathic mind and have the stated goal of reforming India. If this sounds unbelievable, it is not. It is the same sort of magical realism fans of Latin American authors will be familiar with, and adds to the strength, beauty, and ultimate brutality of the story without making the reader roll his eyes in incredulity.     As is India, so is Saleem. He hears the multitudinous voices of India in his head, a mess of contradictions: peace and violence, forgiveness and revenge, progress and tradition. His family also reflects the indefinable character of India. They are by turns real and fantastical, living and dying, perservering and escaping. The amalgam of these voices and Saleem's family is an India that Rushdie seems to understand no better than anyone else, but his affection for and frustration with India could only come from a native.     The reader also follows Saleem's physical life. His face mirrors a map of India, and his enormous nose is gifted at sensing emotions. From the life of a rich boy in Bombay, to a fighter in the India-Pakistan War, to a broken carnival traveller, and finally to an owner of a pickle company, Saleem's journey through life is expansive, human, and always entertaining. The side characters are just as engrossing, and all have a part to play in the tumolt of Indian history.     To keep the earlier analogy going, I found this to be a slightly more difficult read than 'One Hundred Years of Solitude' but just as entertaining as 'Middlesex'. Rushdie writes with wit, style, anger, and absolute brilliance. He is generous with allusions, but I felt they were also extremely accessible. I recommend this book not only to India-philes, but also to fans of literature in general. This is a master in peak and rare form, and this is one of the finest novels written in a generation. Most highly recommended."
1055,Midnight's Children,0099578514,Salman Rushdie,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,I really wonder if anyone else can paint such a true and beuatiful picture of a newly born country in the form of its children.
1056,The Zombie Survival Guide: Complete Protection from the Living Dead,1400049628,Max Brooks,Barnes and Noble,4.4,MissAthena,"I would like to personally thank Max Brooks for this magnificent guide. It helps provide you with weapons flaws and benefits. Ranging from close combat, all the way up to explosives. It helps you prepare your home incase an attack were to form in your location. It educates the reader for defensive, offensive, and fleeing strategic measures. Advice is given for the location of where to rebuild a society if the case would permit to that extent and steps to take for that process. As well as containing information about zombie survival, it contains recorded attacks. With well research, I myself was able to learn about some of these attacks, second hand, not through this book but other resources."
1056,The Zombie Survival Guide: Complete Protection from the Living Dead,1400049628,Max Brooks,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"Max Brooks begins his Zombie Guide by answering the   most important question: What are zombies? Brooks   breaks down the 'fact' from fiction and thoroughly   provides the reader with an in-depth explanation of   Zombies  their characteristics, emotions, (if any), and   worldwide appearances are all described in detail. In a   witty and humorous manner, Brooks examines how   zombies are created, how they infect humans, and most   importantly, how to kill them. He studies and explains the   disease Solanum, which is only transferable via contact   with a zombie. He cites research instances in which   scientists attempted to provide analysis of the disease but   have come up short. Brooks provides a life-saving guide,   which is a necessity in any zombie related mayhem. He   lists several rules to follow in the event of a zombie   infestation, ranging from assembling survival groups to   creating defense strongholds as well as determining the   best type of protection, whether it is a vehicle, weapon or   remote location. Brooks even analyzes all different types   of protection available, from simple household tools to   guns and the most famous zombie-killing weapon, the   chainsaw. He also considers the effect zombies have on   the human psyche. He determines that the fear they   invoke and the constant, low-pitch drone they create is   enough to drive people insane. Thus, Brooks provides   solutions to keep sanity as well as various activities to   alleviate boredom and pass time. Brooks also cites various   instances in human history from 2000 BC Egypt onwards   to modern day occurrences in Central America where   documents, (formulated by Brooks, of course), prove and   record zombie attacks and sightings. At the end of his   guide Brooks even provides the reader with daily logs in   order to keep records and prepare for impending doom.   Brooks expects the reader to slowly prepare for the worst.   He makes it seem as if zombies were real and completely   immerses the reader into the situations provided. Brooks   eventually poses the ultimate question: What if the world   was plagued with a top tier zombie attack? Can humanity   withstand such a crisis? In The Zombie Survival Guide Max   Brooks creates an alternate reality in which zombies are   real and pose an immense threat. The Zombie Survival   Guide is a must-read and is quite the page-turner."
1056,The Zombie Survival Guide: Complete Protection from the Living Dead,1400049628,Max Brooks,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Sara58,"It is not a question if the zombie apocalypse will happen, it's when. As a firm believer in the event, author Max Brooks proves the seriousness of the threat through research and experience. From locations one should avoid to recorded attacks of actual breakouts, The Zombie Survival Guide is an excellent source for surviving the zombie apocalypse. The front cover grabs attention easily; the biggest word is ""zombie"" in black bold letters. The back has the top ten lessons for surviving a zombie attack, listed in red. The book begins with an introduction, stating the purpose of his guide: survival. He proves his credibility and lets the reader know the exact reasoning behind the book, which is great for those skeptical people out there. The book is separated into seven distinct chapters, which is perfect for quick reference points if you ever forget exactly what you need to do. The first chapter breaks down the myths and realities of zombies. He answers all those questions one might have thoroughly and purposefully. The second chapter covers weapons and combat techniques. He breaks every weapon into its own section in which he explains the efficiency or inefficiency of said weapon. The third chapter contains how to be on the defense: what places to hide if you do not properly prepare your home before the invasion occurs. The fourth chapter: on the run. What should you do if you end up in the desert? What type of transportation should you use? The fifth chapter teaches you what to do if you would EVER have to attack, which should be avoided at all costs. The sixth chapter shows how to live in an undead world, which is useful for everyone whether you believe in the apocalypse or not. The last chapter is what really proves his point: recorded attacks. Over 50 recorded so far! He makes all doubts disappear in 70 or so pages. All of this information helped me to prepare and will help me survive the zombie apocalypse. Obviously life is one's most important asset and protecting it should be your number one priority in everything you do. Max Brooks definitely helps you achieve this goal. If you do not believe in the apocalypse, this book may not be for you. However, if you are on the fence about whether it will happen or not happen, you may want to go to your nearest Barnes and Noble, grab it from the shelf, and rush to the counter to buy and study this terrific reference."
1057,The Testament,0440234743,John Grisham,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Okonkwo,"John Grisham has done it again. He has created yet another exhilarating novel that will keep you on our feet from cover to cover. The Testament proves that Grisham is still among the best authors of legal thrillers, having a well-balanced plot that combines adventures and politics. After the multibillionaire Troy Phelan commits suicide, everybody is aching to know who will become the heir of his great fortune. The old man lived by himself, and the tough world of business had taught him to love nobody. When his handwritten, improvised will is read out loud to the public, the mystery is revealed. Troy Phelan decided to leave the entirety of his assets to an illegitimate, completely unknown daughter living as a missionary with a barbaric tribe in Brazil. Now it is up to the lawyer Nathan O'Riley to travel into the wilderness of South America and find the woman that has just inherited eleven billon dollars. Nate must trudge through swamps, storms, rainforests, and even malaria so that the Phelan wealth ends up with its rightful owner, and not the hands of other greedy, malicious people pursuing it.
	Truly, this piece is a literary work of art. IT is among the best thrillers out there, putting up a fair fight to best-selling novels like The Da Vinci Code, by Dan Brown, and The Husband, by Dean Koontz. It realistically depicts the world of law and finance, giving the reader tremendous insight of how the worlds of politics and business are so intricately intertwined, The novel is not only fast-paced and engaging, but also profound and critical, reflecting many flaws present in modern society. Very much like in Kane and Abel, by Jeffrey Archer, The Testament realistically depicts the extent to which money can influence an individual's character, as well  as the mortal consequences of alcohol and drug addictions. Without a doubt, this New York Times Bestseller can quench the thirst of all those adrenaline addicts looking for a Grisham page-turner.
	Like all novels, however, The Testament is most definitely not recommendable to all audiences. Those who have extensive background knowledge on other books by John Grisham can find this literary piece to be very similar to his other works, like The Pelican Brief. Even though The Testament takes place in an exotic environment, it still revolves around the topics of laws, judges, cases, lawyers, and all the same old conflicts in Grisham's books. Additionally, this novel has very limited emotional emphasis. Romanticists in search of love stories will therefore find it to be mercilessly dry, dull, and superficial."
1057,The Testament,0440234743,John Grisham,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"I have read all but one of Grisham's books. The Testament is by far my favorite. From the very first chapter this book demands your attention and devotion. Use caution while reading it because you find yourself walking and reading, cooking and reading, cleaning and reading, you get the picture. I have read this book 3 times since it was first published."
1057,The Testament,0440234743,John Grisham,Barnes and Noble,4.1,BolivarJ,"In the review for this book, Just imagine as I quote the author "" The world at peace"" taking a ride in The Santa Loura with Nate's Pals Jevy and Welly into the Pantanal. Jevy at the wheel, and Welly strumming his guitar and one of us, readers holding a cold beer in our right hand while laying on a hammock. Johh Grisham's ""The Testament"" is an amazing ride full of adventures, an elite of characters, you will come to love, but most of all, a great book that you will not soon forget. It is amazing how John Grisham creates character that are so easy to like. However, in Nate's character there are some strong surprises. His portrait of his highs and lows are beautifully described by the author. The bittersweet reunion with his little children, and Rachel Lane at the end make Nate's character one of the most likable ones. The testament is about faith, character, life, greed, and yes, the pursuit of happiness that people only can find on a higher calling. This is one book that I am sure I will read again."

Written in the thirties, Christie's wry humor and wonderful vocabulary make this a great read! I enjoyed reading mysteries and challenging my vocabulary when I was young, so this is a good book for 11 to infinity. For Anglophiles, a Christie mystery is great with a cup of hot tea and a biscuit (cookie to you Yanks). I'm more familiar with Poirot, but I loved reading the first Miss Marple."

1059,"Among the Hidden (Shadow Children, #1)",1416924981,Margaret Peterson Haddix,Barnes and Noble,4.4,LAPROJECTDUDE,"Among the Hidden by Margaret Haddix created a wonderful reflection on the future. Not only will this book want you to read more of the book, after the ending, you will want to read more and more of this epic series called, The Shadow Children. This book is for kids who want a quick easy read and someone who is looking for and on going series (eight books).     In this capturing book, Haddix makes the future seem even darker then it already seems by enforcing the Poplulation Law which limits each family to a meager two children. Usually a family follows the law, but some of the daring have an illegal third child. these illegal third children are called shadow children. Luke, the main character is known as one of these shadow children. In Among the Hidden, Luke has to hide out in his house by himself, avoiding contact with windows light, or anything that could seem suspicious. After a few days of looking out of his vent (no one could see him there) he notices a flickering light in one of his neighbor's window knowing that all the family was gone. This new possiblity of a shadow child living next door gives Luke new hope. This new hope inspires him to brake into his neighbors new home and meet his new friend Jen. These two shadow children struggle to find what is actually right. Staying in or fighting for their right.           Other books from this grabbing-of-a series include Among the Imposters (book number two) and Among the Betrayed (book number three). Again, this book is a quick easy read and might not be that great for someone who wants to get into a big book, but for those of that kind, there is the on-going series this book is a part of.In this breath- catching, suprise-ending, epic novel Haddix gives the reader a dark, murky reflection of the not-so-far-away future. And does it triumphuntly."
1059,"Among the Hidden (Shadow Children, #1)",1416924981,Margaret Peterson Haddix,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,This is the best book in the whole wide world. If you like the hunger games this book is for you. You will be biting your nails near the middle and the end. The ending is also very suprising. It is about the population law that you can not have over two kids. If you do they will be killed. So allthe third children have to hide from everyone so the population police will not find out. I reccomend this book to fourth firth and sixth graders. I hope this helped!
1060,In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto,1594201455,Michael Pollan,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"I just read a number of reviews and want to write something a little different than what has been expressed.    If this diet is new to you and you are afraid you won't like it, relax. A major change in diet takes time getting used to,but the foods Michael Pollan recommends we eat are delicious.    At one time, I ate processed food, much of it with a high fat content, too much salt and so on. For years now, I have eaten what Pollan suggests. I love the food I eat and now find fatty, processed foods to be inedible.    My tastes have changed. This winter I have been experimenting with new vegetables and ingredients. Yum! Load me up on the simple but delicious flavors of real food!    Author ofthe award winning book,Harmonious Environment: Beautify, Detoxify and Energize Your Life, Your Home and Your Planet"
1060,In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto,1594201455,Michael Pollan,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Hometownulysses,"This is a truly enlightening book. Rather than lay out concrete rules and regulations for a diet, Pollan gives you a whole new way to view food - as whole beings. Rather than reduce food to nutrients, Pollan argues that maybe it's better to eat the orange than take Vitamin C. If you want to improve the way you eat and change your understanding of food, then read this book."
1060,In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto,1594201455,Michael Pollan,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"In a word, Healthy. Michael Pollack's interesting, informative, and eye-opening breakdown of Western food culture to help us figure out ""Why aren't we healthy""? 

Food is good. Food is necessary. Food is... well, just what IS food anyway? Surprisingly, food is living things. Food is the output from living things. Pollack's book suggests however, that what we eat is getting further away from being actual 'food' the more it is processed, enriched, chemically treated, and boxed for long storage and later microwaving.

A compelling read for anyone interested in understanding why things have become so bad for the health of Americans in general, and a source for common sense suggestions for taking back our dinner tables, and possibly shrinking our waistlines. If nothing else, in some measure we may eat - and even BE - healthy. 

Seven words make up the eating guidelines, and it's these seven words that most of us don't do anymore. EAT FOOD. NOT TOO MUCH. MOSTLY PLANTS.

Highly Recommended."
1061,The Witch of Blackbird Pond,0440995779,Elizabeth George Speare,Barnes and Noble,4.3,gumbaya,"I really liked the plot of this story.  I had to read an award winning book for my 5th grade book report.  I chose this and I suspected it would be boring, but it was really fun!  It is about a girl who used to be rich, but whose circumstances change when her grandfather dies.  She goes to live with her puritan Aunt and Uncle then she mets Hannah, a Quaker who is suspected of witchcraft. A really eye-opening view of Puritan times.  If you enjoy learning about different periods in history set within a great story, then this is the book for you."

I feel that Kit's character is someone that a lot of people can indenify with despite the period.  This book teachs you not to be afraid of the unknown, that through hard work and determination one really finds themselves, and finally never to settle.

Never go looking outside of yourself to appease the masses. Love is and always will be there with you. In the words of Hannah herself, ""There is no escape if love is not there.""

Great read!"

But I'm sure the wait will be worth it. A whole new selection series starring Maxon and America's daughter!!!! Now we get to see more of Maxon and America's life PLUS there is a whole new series with I'm sure swoon-worthy romance! It's going to be amazing!!! I literally can't wait! ;)"

Maxon and America's story is a fairytale...entirely perfect. I patiently waited a whole year to find out who America chose and I was not disappointed. Before i knew of the 4th and 5th book, I had wanted there to be a story of their child's selection. I can't tell you how excited I was when keira released she was continuing the series. To say the least, I am obssesed with the selection series. Now onto the the heir, i liked it! It was really weird that america and maxon were not the main part of the story but I'm so glad keira still showed their love for eachother (oh my gosh maxon's reaction to america at the end was heartbreaking?) i hated eadlyn at first. I thought she was self centered and a brat. I couldn't believe she was maxon and america's daughter. As the book progressed, i realized eadlyn was scared. I started to like her more after that. I definetly liked maxon's selection more but eadlyn's had its own pluses. They were bith pretty great? now onto possibly the most important part...the selected. First off the fact that kile was chosen was hilarious? and oh my gosh their kiss? i think eadlyn is falling for kile. Then there's henri... I personally don't think he and eadlyn have a chance but erik... What's going on with erik. Could they fall in love??? I reallg have no idea. I want her to fall in love with kile. They kinda remind me of maxon and america. I also love eadlyn's relationship with ahren but i can't believe he left without telling anyone... And america's heart attack?? i dont know what ill do if america dies... But overall i enjoyed the heir (read it in a night?) hate that it ended in a cliffhanger but can't wait for the next book. Hopefully it won't be the last!!!"

1064,The Woman in White,0141439610,"Wilkie Collins, Matthew Sweet",Barnes and Noble,3.9,CathyB,"The Woman in White is a Victorian mystery that is considered to be one of the best mysteries ever written. Written in 1859, it takes the form of an early detective novel with an amateur sleuth. The plot (man marries woman and schemes to get her money), albeit predictable by today's standards, is plausible, entertaining and, at times, slightly suspenseful. I attribute this slightness to the Victorian language itself. I'm not a fan of that style of speaking and  found myself frustrated at times and thinking just get on with it all ready, stop dragging things out. The story is told from the viewpoints of several characters - much like a legal deposition where each character relates what he/she knows about certain events. 
-----
The characters were interesting and memorable; however, I was disappointed in the characterization/treatment of women - weak and inferior. Was this an accurate portrayal for the times? I don't know. I have read other Victorian novels and didn't come away with the same feeling. Because of his portrayal of women, Mr. Collins didn't do justice to Marion Halcombe, one of the more memorable characters in the novel. A greater role would have been appreciated more by today's society but, in 1859, who knows. Creating a lead woman character who 'out thinks' a man may have been taboo. The other memorable character was Count Fosco, the mastermind behind everything evil in the world. I am being a bit facetious; however, the character was so full of himself that I couldn't help but inflate his imaginary ego a little more. His character was fully developed - I didn't like him and found him frustrating - once again this could be attributed to the Victorian language.
-----
Overall, I did like the novel; however, the above issues prevent me from giving it more than three stars. I recommend to those who enjoy Victorian literature and those who would like to read one of the first mystery novels. This is a long book and not a quick read - you will be in it for the long haul - which you will enjoy."

I love the Victorian, Jane Austenesque language of the book. The plot is also intricate and promising. But it was just too dang long to get where it was going. Somewhere along the way I read that this had  been a serialized novel published in a paper. I could see that and I had the same problem with another book compiled from a serial. Also while the plot was good on its own merits, the way it gets tied up at the end is disappointing in terms of the characters involved. That being said, if you love the writing coming from this time period, you will find this book satisfying. If you love intrigue and mystery you will also find something satisfactory in this book. But, Wilkie, couldn't you have just gotten to the point quicker!"

The characters were very realistic, and I loved that, even though Belly's whinning got on my nerves at times...but that's a typical 15-year-old girl. This was a very touching story.
The only complaint I have is the confusion of time. The author didn't indicate very clearly when she was talking about the past and when she was talking about the present, but once I got the hang of it (around the middle of the book) it was easy to follow. 
Just to spare you the same confusion, Belly is 15 in the present. When she talks about the past she was 13. And her friend Taylor came to stay with her, it was in the past when she was 13.

But Stephanie's also been promised a $1000 under-the-counter payoff from Maxine's ex-boyfriend, Eddie Kuntz who says he wants to retrieve some potentially embarrassing love letters that might damage his macho reputation ""with the chicks"". The case ratchets up to new heights of raucous, raunchy comedy when Stephanie teams up with Sally Sweet, a hairy seven foot tall cross-dressing rock singer who's shacked up with a very jealous, very gay, very male Marilyn Monroe look-alike.Four musketeers out on the prowl - Stephanie, Sally Sweet, Lula, the 200 pound black reformed prostitute with a heart of gold and a mouth of pure dirt plus Grandma Mazur - definitely make for some laugh out loud moments. But, for my money, this entry in the Stephanie Plum series didn't quite tickle my funny bone in the same way as the previous three novels. Evanovich's usual clever comedy and wit started to fall by the wayside and were increasingly replaced by Vaudevillian physical comedy and enormous helpings of vulgar trash talk designed to entertain by shock value.While there was some definite warm-hearted and enjoyable movement forward in Stephanie's relationship with long-standing love interest, cop Joe Morelli (not to mention some pretty hot action in the boudoir, the kitchen, the hall and the shower among other locations), the formulaic approach to the plot line in her stories is also beginning to wear thin after only four novels. Stephanie's apparently harmless chases after low level FTAs that look like they're going to be easy-picking low hanging fruit always seem to coincidentally cross paths and mesh with Morelli's much more complex cases. This time around is no different. Morelli's hooked up with the Feds chasing counterfeiters and money launderers and it isn't long before Stephanie finds herself involved in Morelli's case and up to her neck in mayhem, murder and mutilation.That kind of coincidence might work once or twice but to repeat it over and over again verges on silliness. Even for a series like Stephanie Plum that is clearly pure parody, it wears thin.For new readers, ""Four to Score"" probably is worthy of four stars as a stand-alone entertaining comedic parody of the typical PI novels and more serious mysteries out there. But for continuing fans, ""Four to Score"" is getting tired and has probably dropped to a somewhat lower three star rating. I'll still read ""High Five"", the next in the series, but if it's a repeat performance of ""Four to Score"" that will put paid to Stephanie Plum for me.Recommended.Paul Weiss"

I laugh out loud at Lula and Stephanie - and in another 20 years, its my goal to be just like Grandma Mazur 'just kidding, of course'....I'm reading the books in order and the books just get more entertaining as I read them.  Stephanie may not be 'wonder woman', but she always does manage to 'get her man'.....and at the end of the day, there's just nothing like the Evanovich sense of humor."

I thoroughly enjoyed the captivating life stories of James and of his white, Jewish mother.

I would recommend the poignant and touching accounts of James and his mother to anyone of any race, any religion, and any background."

That's how good the book is to read. McBride provides excellent details and gives the reader a good view of what the characters are like and what their purpose is in the story. James McBride is an author I would like to meet and I will for sure read 'The Color of Water' again and I will most definitely read more books writen by McBride. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to others. The book will, I think, give people more of an understanding of what black people had to go through in the 1990's. It will also give people an understanding of what a white mother had to go through while raising twelve black children. Over all, I think, 'The Color of Water' is a book every one should read."

I love that they take the ""truths"" that the world hold as self evident and test them. From the radio interviews I have heard it is obvious that some people believe that some things shouldn't be considered. I was floored when their analysis showed that walking drunk was significantly more dangerous than driving drunk. They, of course, are not recommending that we drive drunk (are you stupid, or what?) but that we be more mindful of our decisions.

Right down to how beautiful her hair is, and her beautiful eyes.  This, continues on and on through out this book.  Still, I found to subject matter decent.  Just understand, everyone in this book seems to be both beautiful, strong and so on.  Also, considering the main character is all of twenty two years old.  And, had never been far from her small home town.  The writing style would suggest that she's wise way beyond her years.  Now, having said this, I have to go.  I need to find the second in the series, so I can find out where the first book left off, and the rest of the story continues.  I, believe this is will appeal more to females, than males.  But again, here I am a fifty something retired military man finding I need to read more.  Just, so I can find out the rest of what is happening in the next series.  Thanks, and good day friends"

1072,Heart of the Matter,0312554168,Emily Giffin,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Jeanelle_C,"Heart of the Matter is an astounding and contemporary read. This book is layered, told from two points of view from a brokenhearted single mother struggling with circumstances she did not wish for herself and a stay at home mother battling through the boredom and monotony of motherhood. Both women are on a mission for personal fulfillment in the novel as their lives become connected by a heartbreaking accident. The story is a page turner filled with emotion jerking words that are both relatable and tangible. 





I appreciated the detailed medical procedures, sports matches and elementary schools application process scenes that I possibly would not have understood otherwise without the author being so descriptive in her writing. The author also has an aptitude for understanding the human experience, especially the experience of living amongst the judgment, rivalry, loneliness, need to feel completed and to be continually happy that many women face today as well as men. Many love her earlier books but I will have to go out on a possibly blasphemous limb and say that Heart of the Matter is her best, should they ever be compared. The content of the book is true literary escapism and so true to life. Single, married, old, young and women from any walk of life can relate to this book. Please do not dismiss this book as a narrative lacking substance. There is so much to this story. Well done Emily Giffin, five stars well deserved!"

1073,Vanity Fair,0141439831,"William Makepeace Thackeray, John Carey",Barnes and Noble,3.6,inkarus,"Surprisingly, after over 150 years, Vanity Fair is still a page-turner.  This novel is supposed to be a groundbreaking work of ""English realism"" for its time (middle 1800's), but is surprisingly pertinent to today's consumer-oriented culture.  Anyone who wants a slightly cynical look at the human condition will really enjoy this rendition of the foibles of human society and the sharply drawn characters of Becky Sharp, Emmy Sedly and her brother, Jos., and Thackeray's alter-ego, Dobbin (who is a bit too virtuous, of course).  Not only is it a classic but it is very entertaining.  It helps, however, to know just a bit of French an German, since there are a few foreign phrases salted in here and there.  Even if you are in the dark about these exotic expressions, however, there are plenty of quips and escapades to keep you amused and anxious to move from chapter to chapter.

I would have given Vanity Fair five stars, except for the difficulty of downloading the entire novel.  My first attempt produced a (1853) download of the beginning third of the book (despite being told I was downloading ""Vanity Fair"").  My next attempt got farther, however this version ended in mid-sentence.  I then downloaded another ""Vanity Fair, Vol. II"", which picked up later than the point at which I was dumped by my second attempt,and this third (and final) download also included another short novel not noted on the cover page.  Furthermore, the OCR image of the ""Vol II"" final download had a fair number of uncorrected errors, although it was usually possible to understand what was in the original.  I managed to fill in the missing chapters between my second and third downloads from a paperback I had purchased (I had only downloaded to the Nook because it is more convenient to read than a fat paperback).  These problems with the descriptions of the various copies available for download limit the overall enjoyment of the reading experience.  B&N needs to clear up these problems before they can expect perfect scores!
   The novel is well worth the effort, however."
1073,Vanity Fair,0141439831,"William Makepeace Thackeray, John Carey",Barnes and Noble,3.6,Anonymous,"I just finished reading vanity fair and was very pleased with the book. There were some parts that were alittle boring but the rest of the book makes up for it. The ending, in particular, could not have been better. This is a very big book and does take alot of time to read, however, it is well worth it. I read Anna korenina right before Vanity Fair, and I have to say that this one is much better. Vanity Fair is definately going into my book collection."

You know, before reading Vanity Fair, I had no idea how bad the magazine disgraces this great book. I loved it!

1074,The Sirens of Titan,1857988841,Kurt Vonnegut Jr.,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Tyler-S,"The Sirens of Titan is the best Vonnegut book I've read by far.  It tells of Malachai Constant, the richest man on Earth, and his adventure through space.  This science fiction story is just great in every way imaginable.  The characters are deep, the plot is meaningful, and the theme will blow your mind away.  Vonnegut's 'The Sirens of Titan' questions the whole reason of mankind's existence on earth, and adds a completely unique theory to how and why we came to arrive on our planet.  It will definitely get you thinking."
1074,The Sirens of Titan,1857988841,Kurt Vonnegut Jr.,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"Once you start this book, you will want to read directly through to the finish in one sitting.  Vonnegut creates entire worlds through writing, and entirely new creatures.  This book can be best descibed as a 'Sci-Fi-Drama,' because it intertwines human emotion into a science-fiction atmosphere.  After you finish this book, you will take at least twenty minutes to sit back and contemplate life.  Believe me.  I did."
1074,The Sirens of Titan,1857988841,Kurt Vonnegut Jr.,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"I had never read any Vonnegut until a friend told me I had to read this book and loaned it to me. I thought slaughterhouse five was some kind fo slasher movie.   Anyway, I started this and was completely surprised. Vonnegut tells this strange science fiction story well. He's got a great imagination. The way the story wraps around on itself is amazing. The ideas he came up with to make the story work are very creative. I haven't read anything else of his yet, but I look forward to trying. 
The same friend gave me 'Visions of Reality' by David Gregory, which, in my experience, is as close as current writers get to this sort of wildly creative Science fiction."

1075,Dolores Claiborne,2266047426,"Stephen King, Dominique Dill",Barnes and Noble,3.8,PhoebeReading on LibraryThing,"How the hell does Stephen King create such sympathetic, multifaceted, complex and wonderfully written sixty-year-old women?I initially found myself extremely annoyed by the lack of chapter breaks. This is my problem, really, not King's, because I don't have the self control to stop reading without a discernible break in the action. But there is no break here, and that's the point--Dolores' four hundred page monologue sweeps the reader rapidly through a rather ugly life. By the time we get to the horrific act itself, she feels like an undeniably real woman, a consciousness as concrete as our own. I think I like King best when he's closest to reality--here, the supernatural is only delicately hinted at. What's horrific about the killing of Joe St. George isn't that there are supernatural spookies behind it, but that it's realistic, disgustingly so. The ending is a bit neat for my tastes, but after we've been so thoroughly convinced that Dolores Claiborne is worth cheering for, it's hard not to feel satisfied at her triumph."
1075,Dolores Claiborne,2266047426,"Stephen King, Dominique Dill",Barnes and Noble,3.8,BookBindingBobby on LibraryThing,"Stephen King. How do you perceive him? Well, forget about all that, because in Dolores Claiborne, we find one of the richest, beautiful stories ever told. And it isn't even horror. Stephen King shows us his talents like never before, with a book that is told as a monologue, about a grouchy, loving mother named Dolores, seeking revenge against her abusive husband Joe. A few uncomfortable scenes are present, but they add to the story. Another hit by King."

If you like fantasy in an urban setting, tight storytelling, intriguing art, and great dialogue you should pick up this book.    The first issue from DC is completely sold out! The only way to get this storyline now is to either beg it off of a friend who has it, or to pick up this trade paperback!    The premise of the book itself is simple. Characters from fairy tales, folk tales, mythology, and world literature have been chased out of their homelands and are now living in modern America. A large number of the humanoid (or those who can purchase a glamour to make them appear so) live in a community in New York City. Many of the non humanoids live on a farm in upstate New York.    This first trade paperback deals with a murder mystery. Rose Red has disappeared under mysterious circumstances and a sinister message ""No More Happily Ever After"". The Big Bad Wolf (now known as Bigby Wolf) is investigating the case. The suspects include (but are not limited to): Prince Charming, Bluebeard, and Snow White."
1077,"Fables, Vol. 1: Legends in Exile",1563899426,"Bill Willingham, Lan Medina, Steve Leialoha, Craig Hamilton, James Jean",Barnes and Noble,4.3,theokester,"I've heard good things about this series and have almost picked it up many times over the past year or so. I finally broke down and grabbed a copy a couple of weeks ago and I'm really glad I did.

I've enjoyed a lot of the ""fairy tale retelling"" stories that have been coming around lately, some more than others. What I found even more fun about this premise is that the fairy tale characters have been dislocated from their fairy tale worlds and are now living in our world.trying to 'fit in' but also striving to maintain their own identities.

The character development and presentation was excellent. I loved the adult depth given to these characters that are otherwise fairly 2-dimensional. Seeing Jack (of Beanstalk fame) as a conniving, lying, scheming, unsuccessful con-man of sorts was great. Snow White as the semi-snobbish clean cut acting-leader felt a little flat at first, but as the story went on and we saw more into her personality, she became even more intriguing. Prince Charming was great as the over-confident schmoozer. But my favorite had to be the portrayal of ""Bigby"" (as in ""Big Bad"" Wolf) as a sort of noir detective for the fairy tale folks. Having just recently read Red Harvest, I had a feel for the hard-boiled detective and really liked Bigby's portrayal.

The art in this novel was well done and a lot of fun. The central art was clean and nice and helped the story along..while at the same time, the artist had a lot of fun along the periphery by adding in small details that added humor or tension to the scenes and may not even be picked up on (I'm sure I missed a lot of the subtleties).

The story was engaging and very interesting. At the heart of this particular book (the first in the series), there was some focus on introducing us to the characters. By doing it through the course of a murder mystery, it allowed the author to provide backstory without it sounding like contrived monologues. The mystery itself was a lot of fun and very engaging. I wish I could say I had it figured out before the very end.but I can't. I did suspect something along the lines of what happened, but not exactly as it played out, which (in my opinion) is the way a good mystery novel should be framed (the reader shouldn't be able to figure things out too easily, but should feel like they came just inches behind the detective).

[Photo]I was a little turned off by the amount of swearing in the book (I would love to have been able to share this with my kids, but the language will definitely make me keep it out of their hands for at least the next few years). There were a couple of scenes of violence which were a little over the top (especially for young readers), but weren't overly graphic or offensive. And the one ""sex scene"" and the couple of suggestive panels we in the PG to PG-13 range. Overall, a movie version of the book would probably receive a PG-13 rating, possibly pushed to R if they decided to overplay the language/violence or expound on the sex. 

Overall, this was a great read and a very fun world filled with wonderful characters. I'm definitely planning to follow this series (from the B&N shelf, it looks like there are 10+ books already). I may have to increase my book allowance so I can catch up more quickly."
1077,"Fables, Vol. 1: Legends in Exile",1563899426,"Bill Willingham, Lan Medina, Steve Leialoha, Craig Hamilton, James Jean",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"I just started reading the Fables series last week and have quickly made it up to the 22nd or so issue, each just as enjoyable as the last.  I had no idea what the big deal seemed to be about this series, but as other reviewers have pointed out, it has a very addictive and magical charm to it.  Keeping the backgrounds of the characters remarkably intact while thrusting them into a modern world, with much more mature themes, makes for very compelling reading.  Excellent writing, beautiful art which makes a perfect fit for these stories.  I would highly recommend this title."
1078,Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity,0142000280,David    Allen,Barnes and Noble,4,David_Beck,"GTD rests on the principle that a person needs to move tasks out of the mind by recording them externally. That way, the mind is freed from the job of remembering everything that needs to be done, and can concentrate on actually performing those tasks. GTD is based on making it easy to store, track and retrieve all information related to the things that need to get done. Allen suggests that many of the mental blocks we encounter are caused by insufficient 'front-end' planning (i.e., for any project we need to clarify what is to be achieved and what specific actions are needed to achieve it). It is most practical, according to Allen, to do this thinking in advance, generating a series of actions which we can later undertake without any further planning. Allen contends that our mental ""reminder system"" is inefficient and seldom reminds us of what we need to do at the time and place that we can do it. Consequently, the ""next actions"" act as an external support which ensures that we are presented with the right reminders at the right time. The core principles of GTD are: Collect: The notion of stress-free productivity starts with off-loading what needs to get done from one's head, capturing everything that is necessary to track, remember, or take action on, into what Allen calls a bucket: a physical inbox, an email inbox, a tape recorder, a notebook, a PDA, a desktop, etc. The idea is to get everything out of one's head and into a collection device, ready for processing. All buckets should be emptied (processed) at least once per week. Process: When processing a bucket, a strict workflow is required. If it takes under two minutes to do something, it should be done immediately. The two-minute rule is a guideline, encompassing roughly the time it would take to formally defer the action. Organize: Allen describes a suggested set of lists which can be used to keep track of items awaiting attention, including a calendar which is important for keeping track of appointments and commitments; however, Allen specifically recommends that the calendar be reserved for the hard landscape: things which absolutely have to be done by a particular deadline, or meetings and appointments which are fixed in time and place. To-do items should be reserved for the next action lists. Review: The lists of actions and reminders will be of little use if not reviewed at least daily, or whenever possible. Given the time, energy and resources available at a particular moment, one must decide the most important task to be done immediately, and do it. If one is inclined to procrastinate, one may end up always doing the easy tasks and avoiding the difficult ones. To solve this, one can decide to do the actions of the list one by one, following their order, just like processing an inbox. Do: Any organizational system is no good if excessive time is spent organizing tasks instead of actually doing them. Allen's contention is that if one can make it simple, easy, and fun to take the necessary actions, one will be less inclined to procrastinate or become overwhelmed with too many 'open loops'. Phew! It's a lot, but it's a lot of useful information and a foolproof system once you get it all down. Another book that I strongly recommend because it has helped me immensely when it comes to managing myself and keeping on track is: ""The Emotional Intelligence Quick Book"""

I've nearly finished reading it - for the first time, and I think I'll read it again and take better notes.  But the editing in the ebook version is HORRIBLE.  The editor may not realize you need spaces between ALL the words, not just some of them.  There are sentences where you have to delete or add a word for it to make sense.  I'm sure this isn't how the book was written, but the publisher needs to issue us an update.

I'd give it five stars for content, but 1 star for editing - so I'm splitting the difference and calling it a three."

Samantha Reed's mother is the type of person who believes herself to be &quot;above&quot; certain others. Their next door neighbors are some of these people. I love the fact that while Samantha's mother complains about just about everything about the Garrett's in actuality its their own family that is the disaster. 

Jase is such an AMAZING male lead in this book. I love the world he opens up for Samantha. Not only has she watched his family ever since she can remember, but he has noticed she watched. Their friendship which blossoms into a genuine romance is great to watch unfold.

I completely fell in love with all of the characters of this story. The twist in this is a BIG one and you find yourself asking what you would do in that situation. 

Stand out Young Adult Novel. I highly recommend it!"

1080,My Life Next Door,0803736991,Huntley Fitzpatrick,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Cupcakegirly,"Once I started it, I couldn't read it fast enough and yet I didn't want it to end. This is a beautifully written story about family and friendship, first love, and learning how to be true to yourself. Huntley Fitzpatrick writes about life with all it's quirkiness, even covering tough topics like politics and addiction with such honesty and humor that had me laughing so hard I cried. Samantha Reed lives a life of relative privilege with her single mother and older sister that includes private school, weekly dinners at the local country club and a summer job where she gets to spend time with her long time BFF, Nan and her twin brother, Tim. Life isn't always what it seems and Samantha's is no different. Her Mom's a Senator and a contradiction of sorts. On one hand, she's rarely around but when she is, she takes ""involved"" to a whole new level, going as far as checking to see if Samantha's hair is properly conditioned and making sure she's in bed by a certain time each night. (She's seventeen, not seven for crying out loud!) Then there's the issue with the vacuum cleaner and making sure the lines in the carpet are just right. OCD, much? Samantha takes refuge each night on the balcony off her room where she's able to watch the Garretts, the family who lives next door. They're the ones with the 25 kids who obviously never learned what birth control was for or how to properly care for a pool, a yard or a house but managed to snag their own reality T.V. show on TLC. Oh, wait...wrong family. The Garretts really only have 8 kids and yeah, they have all those other things I mentioned, save for the reality T.V. show but that's they way they're treated by a lot of people in town. People feel the need to comment on their lives, how many kids they have, etc., etc., What outsiders fail to miss is how much love the Garretts have going on. Samantha has secretly watched the Garretts for years, something her mother would have a cow over if she ever found out. Her mother thinks the Garretts are ""those kind"" of people and turns her nose up at them any chance she gets. But all that's about to change when Jase, the smart, funny, considerate and of course, gorgeous boy from the wrong side of the fence decides to climb Samantha's trellis. One simple question will begin a journey of love and adventure that neither Samantha or Jase will ever forget and one that will change both of their families lives' forever. Jase and his family immediately suck Samantha into their big, loud, crazy and close-nit family. Much of the time she is completely out of her element and you can feel her mix of discomfort and fascination which is nothing short of hilarious! She isn't used to life in Garrettville but she's learning to love it and who she is when she's there. But each time Samantha goes home, she still struggles with having to be the person her mother expects her to be. The more time she spends with the Garretts though, the more she learns how to love people even with all of their shortcomings, how to handle delicate situations with little people and the importance of doing what's right regardless of what others may think. Just when Samantha thinks her life couldn't get any better, one choice changes everything leaving her to decide whether what she and Jase have is worth fighting for or if family always comes first. Making the right choice isn't always easy but it's always worth it. READ THIS BOOK, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!"
1081,Winter of the World (The Century Trilogy #2),0525952926,Ken Follett,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"These imbeciles who do book reviews based on COST should put a sock in it and go to the library.  If you can't afford to buy a book, don't complain and post a bad review when readers are looking for reviews about the CONTENT of the book.  Most, if not all people who read book reviews are not interested in your sob stories about how you should get all your eBooks for free because you feel entitled.  I'm sure you don't think twice about spending twenty bucks on junk at your local Walmart.  

Second book in trilogy is as good as or even better than the first.  Can't put it down, except for when I have to work.  Ken Follett is a master at creating characters that are so colorful and fascinating that I wish I could step into the book and meet them.  The amount of historical research that Follett had to do is amazing.  Maybe he should do all of that research and writing for free..."
1081,Winter of the World (The Century Trilogy #2),0525952926,Ken Follett,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"Good Lord--what happened?!  ""Fall of Giants,"" the first book in the proposed trilogy, is a wonderful, ""grab you"" read. It was like the best comfort food on a dreary day, and I read it in one long sitting.  Waiting for this, I was terribly excited...and and utterly crushed to find this next volume largely unreadable.  It's a huge disappointment.

***WAY too many characters, WAY too many plotlines and little to no in depth characterization--there's no time! Therefore, it becomes not only difficult to keep track of who they are, where they are--but to care about them.  That was not a problem in ""Giants,"" but here?  This rambles to the point where, at times, I found myself skimming.  With the exception of Lloyd and Robert (who, unless I  missed it, just disappears in the first 150 pages and is never mentioned again)--the rest? Uh--whatever.  ""Pillars of the Earth"" also proved Follett can masterfully handle a large scope...but this does not work.

***Tries too hard to be too many places; there seems to be a need to have ALL the characters in history's hot spots: Berlin, Pearl Harbor, Midway, the Solomon Islands, meeting Hitler, being in Parliament, seeing Churchill, rescuing Blitz victims--it's too much and begins to read as too contrived. (Long lost and now estranged brothers suddenly finding each other as one is dying in a RAF battle...come on)

***Ponderous pace and writing; while ""Giants"" moves swiftly, getting us involved in the characters' plights, this is wooden.  At times, the prose is mechanical, leaden--no elegance or grace.  Minute battle details that lose attention quickly--then areas brushed over that would probably grab our attention.

If half the characters, half the scope and half the length were cut--we'd still have a 500 page novel--and a gripping, intriguing read.  This is mind boggling and pretty much tells me that even if part three takes another two years...no matter.  I won't be reading it.  Oh--so disappointed."
1081,Winter of the World (The Century Trilogy #2),0525952926,Ken Follett,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"Following the ""Fall of Giants"" this second installment in the Century Trilogy follows the five families from the Nazi encroachment in Germany in 1933 through World War II and the atomic bomb. Follett paints a portrait of an atrocious period in our world with an interwoven web of darkness, hope, crisis, and despair. Presented through American, German, Russian, English, and Welsh perspectives, the characters play out this drama with harmony and discord. Even staunch Follett fans will find it somewhat difficult to plow through this latest tale. Although the historic accounts and the inclusion of real historical figures add a wonderful dimension, too often the characters get lost in tiring repeated opinions, political and moral discourses, and lengthy literary proselytizing. The style is leaning too much towards James Michener's sweeping verbose sagas and further from Mr. Follett's gripping, memorable narratives originated in ""Pillars of the Earth."" I am on the fence about reading the third installment."

Some people may like an ending that is vague, so it can be Imagined, but I found it to be an anticlimax. Mr. Murakami is a very creative author and describes his characters and settings with great detail, non of which is repetitive and some of his observations of mundane daily human life are thought provoking. I gave it a 5/5 as it was well written, but just not the mind gripping tale I had hoped it would be. His IQ84 would be a 10/5 in comparison."

This was too short for it to be developed properly. The hero and heroine were already in love when the story begins. They just hadn't admitted to it. They get stranded in a cabin due to a snow storm and finally hook up. They next morning they admit to being in love, quick epilogue, the end. They are both likeable characters (although the hero was a tad arrogant for my taste) and the sex scene was hot, hence the extra star."

1083,Lucky,033041836X,Alice Sebold,Barnes and Noble,4.7,JackiesBookWorld,"Nobody Does it Better is Lauren Blakely’s latest book/novella in the Lucky in Love series that is funny, steamy and romantic. A definite must -read to those that love a good forbidden romance story! 

In this story we get to meet Shaw and Vanessa who are connected by Perri (Shaw’s sister and Vanessa’s best friend). Although they have been friends for a while, it has always been clear to Shaw that Vanessa is off-limits, but that hasn’t stopped him from wanting her. On the other hand, Vanessa’s loyalty lies with Perri and she can’t do anything about her feelings for Shaw because she is afraid of what Perri might say. So the two have been avoiding what they have for each other and with Perri’s wedding on the way it has become a race for some very interesting matchmakers to get the two of them together. Yet neither expected to get stranded in a cabin when a storm hits and now they have to face each other and find out if what they feel is mutual or not. 

I absolutely loved reading this story, it was sweet and swoon worthy! Now since it is a novella we don’t get to read an extended version of the story, so the pace is faster but well thought out. Blakely managed to deliver yet another story full of interesting characters and storyline. Shaw is everything you would want in a leading character, he is charming and has a way with words to leave you swooning for the guy. He is also a very sexy firefighter who loves what he does every day no matter how risky it can be. Vanessa has an interesting taste in fashion and owns a bowling alley. She is cool and has a charming personality. So it’s no surprise that the two would click right away. Their chemistry is instant and undeniable. But they maintain loyalties to those that they are closest to and that is Perri. It was nice to see how they are close to their siblings and to their friends. Previous characters make appearances but this can be real as a stand alone. All in all, if you are looking for a short story full of swoon worthy moments then I would highly suggest reading this novella and any other books by the author. You will not regret it! :)

1084,To the Lighthouse,140679239X,Virginia Woolf,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Though it was somewhat difficult to get through, it was amazingly written. I read the book 6 months ago, and I can still vividly remember scenes from the book. I especially liked the one and only scene in the book with Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey alone. I still remember it after all these months."
1084,To the Lighthouse,140679239X,Virginia Woolf,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,"Ms. Woolf has crafted some of the most wondeful, idiosyncratic and mystifying sentences in the English language, and, in the process, has created a portrait of a family that is unerring in its truth. Yes, the book is difficult, but the rewards are great, as the changes wrought by war, death, marriage, age and life itself are slowly revealed. This is my favorite book because it exemplifies all that literature can be and more, and I'm only 17. If I can reap the benefits of such a literary wonder, you can too."
1084,To the Lighthouse,140679239X,Virginia Woolf,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,"This book was my first encounter with Virginia Woolf's work and it will certainly not be the last. From the moment I opened the book, I was engrossed with Virginia's ability to create an ebb and flow of human emotion mirror the actual presence of the ocean. As you read the innermost thought of the characters you connect with them, seeing small clips of characteristics that describe yourself. This book is a minor taste of the stream-of-consciousness movement that Woolf was a part of, but is not as difficult to follow as the works of Joyce and others."

It is no literary masterpiece and it would be wrong to compare it with one. It is a dime novel through and through and a good one at that. It offers a good, quick read - it is a page turner and keeps you hooked till the end.   Good pieces of literature linger with you even when you have read the last word. This is not one of them. It does not leave any lingering impressions. You do feel a little good and warm when you reach the end.  If you have to while away an afternoon or have a long commute or have to pass a long night or if you have watched the movie pick up this book - it won't disappoint; just don't expect to gain anything from it.  This is the best piece by Mr. C and his writing has gone positively downhill with each subsequent work."

1086,"Guilty Pleasures (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, #1)",0425197549,Laurell K. Hamilton,Barnes and Noble,4.2,FDRoe_282,"The first book of the Anita Blake series was highly entertaining. I picked up this book originally because of Twilight withdrawal. The only thing Twilight and Guilty Pleasures have in common is the fact there are humans, vampires, and werewolves. That's about it. This book was positively addicting. Anita Blake is the type of characeter you hope to find in books. She is edgy, witty, and accessible. I wasn't expecting to be sucked into Laurell K. Hamilton's world so easily. After reading this, I immediately had to continue with the other books. I read nothing but the first nine in the Anita Blake series, and still working on reading through the rest.
I reccommend this to anyone who like vampires, or werewolves. Anyone who is a Twilight fan or fan of similiar titles. As well as anyone who wants a fairly quick read that's simply entertaining."
1086,"Guilty Pleasures (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, #1)",0425197549,Laurell K. Hamilton,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"Ok--I do love vampires.  Werewolves, too.  So I was really excited to read this series and was left disappointed.  The plot was all over the place with major chunks left out or it simply wasn't cohesive.  Anita's character made decisions that made no sense and I found myself skipping over some of the big ""fight"" scenes because they lost my interest--the gore factor was superfluous and the fact that Anita got attacked every time she returned to her apartment got old very quickly. And all the taglines for this series promised it would be sexy and sultry, but those scenes were few and far between, or not even present.  I bought & read the first 4 books and they didn't get any better, so I'm done.  Kresley Cole and Gina Showalter write far more interesting, sexy, & funny fantasy/romance books--I would recommend those over the Anita Blake series."
1086,"Guilty Pleasures (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, #1)",0425197549,Laurell K. Hamilton,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Fangbanger,"The world that Anita Blake lives in is a lot like our own.  The one major difference is that vampires, lycanthropes, and other creatures that go bump in the night are real.  Not only are they real, but they are legal.  The city of St. Louis has a thriving vampire district.  Anita Blake, the main protagonist of this great series of books, is an animator and part-time vampire slayer.  She is quite good at both of her jobs and has earned the nickname the ""Executioner"" for the amount of vampire kills she has to her credit.  She is also a consultant for the Regional Preternatural Investigation Team or RPIT.  Anita's main job is working for Animators Inc, and using her birth given ability to raise the dead.  Anita is small in stature, but makes up for it by being uncommonly standoffish and in your face.  She is not afraid to use the Browning High Power that she keeps with her at all times.  Anita is a great character.  She anchors this series and is a great narrator.  Thre thrust of this first novel comes from old vampires, dubbed Master Vampires, being killed.  Her normal enemies come to the Executioner for aid.  They are at first rebuffed but Anita is soon convinced when someone she cares about is put in danger.  Anita is skilled in dealing with the vampires.  She knows not to look them directly in the eyes.  She also keeps her gun loaded with silver bullets.  The debut of this series is a quick read and introduces a few of the mainstays of the series.  The cops who work in RPIT, Rudolph ""Dolph"" Storr, and the wisecracking Zebrowski, Anita's best friend and PI, Veronica ""Ronnie"" Sims, and of course, Jean-Claude, wanna be Master of the City of St. Louis, and otherworldly gorgeous.  Anita is in immediate lust with him and that causes her quite a few issues.  This was a great, face paced read, that kicked off the series with a bang.  If you're a fan of vampires or other supernatural fiction I would give it a shot.  You won't be disappointed."
1087,I Am the Messenger,0375836675,Markus Zusak,Barnes and Noble,4.4,TeensReadToo,"Ed Kennedy is a nineteen-year-old cab driver who is kind of a nobody! He hasn't achieved anything great, isn't a genius, his mom despises him, and his dad died of alcoholism. The only real thing that he has is his dog, named the Doorman, who everyone says desperately needs a bath. And, he's in love with Audrey, a girl from a bad neighborhood, just like him, who also happens to be one of his best friends since forever. The thing is, Audrey doesn't know that Ed is in love with her, and worse yet, she says she doesn't believe in love. One day, Ed and his friend stop at a local bank, but a robbery begins while they are in line. And Ed stops the guy. So then he becomes a local hero. He is just trying to live a normal life, and then he gets a playing card in the mail with three addresses and times on it. Ed doesn't know what to do. Should he just throw the card away, like his friends instruct, or should he go to the first address to see what this is all about? This book would be a good recommendation for fans of THE DA VINCI CODE and the movie National Treasure. Ed is such a cool character! He seems like such a normal guy, who does things that normal guys do, and lives a very ordinary life. Until he gets the card in the mail, and he's not so ordinary anymore."
1087,I Am the Messenger,0375836675,Markus Zusak,Barnes and Noble,4.4,MeleeMelon,"Markus Zusak is the best author ever-NO JOKE! The only book I can say is better than this one is The Book Thief (also by him). The story is perfect for finding yourself and realizing that you're not the only person in the world, and even though you think your life is bad there are other people in the world who are worse off than you. I love this book and not one person I know that's read it has disliked it."

Lucky for me, I found this!  I can say honestly, it is one of my favorite books and one of only two that I literally could not put down.  I found myself up at two in the morning with half of the book still to go and all I could think was ""I can finish it....I have to finish it!""The story line is simple enough.  A young man accidentally foils a bank robbery and because of that is singled out (by someone) to become a hero.  They start sending him playing cards in the mail, each with three clues on it.  He has to figure out the clues and do whatever needs doing.  The results vary with everything from his befriending an old woman who has no one else left in her life, to stopping a man who has been beating his wife and child most of their lives.  In the end, he learns a lot about himself.It is an incredible, emotionally gripping roller coaster that will leave you thinking back on every decision you've made in your life and evaluating how it has affected you and those around you.  It will challenge you by making you think about how you affect people around in your life.  I highly recommend it for any teen or adult who loves the sort of book that you can't forget.  This is a great book club title because it encourages discussion and, quite frankly, you can't help but want to share it!"

It took quite awhile for me to work my way through this book.  I almost quit reading it several times.  The writing style definitely takes some concentration.  I felt more comfortable with the 'prose' after about ten chapters of reading.  Some of the sentences stretch on for an entire paragraph (which takes some getting used to).  The next sentence is a typical example of the sentence structure:  ""For dreariness nothing could surpass a prospect in the outskirts of the city of Melchester at a later hour on this same snowy evening - if that may be called a prospect of which the chief constituent was darkness.""  This book is not for the average modern reader."

I was starting the book at the time and thought, ""Really?"", because the first chapters are rather slow with few interesting parts.

Thank goodness I don't give up on books I start because this tale of a sheep herder, a girl whom he falls in love, and their interwoven lives within a rural English farming town (including a classic English gentlemen) was superbly captivating.

I also liked the overarching theme that failures in life, though dark and fearful, can be the commencement of something greater and better for someone in the future."

The descriptions of the 19th century country side are crafted as only a master could.  I savoured this novel and the tale has continued to haunt me.  I probably would not have enjoyed it in my younger days but now relished the impressions Hardy paints for us of time and place. I highly recommend it."

Danielewski,Barnes and Noble,4.2,FocoProject,"Though I was warned, by reading the sleeve, that this would be experimental reading, nothing could have prepared me for the trip this book took me in. By far, this is the most fun I have had reading a book, literally. And when they used the word experimental to describe it, they were not using it lightly, I have read nothing like it in my life.The story is actually a series of embedded stories, told by the person, who writes the introduction to the book, named Johnny Truant, who finds the actual book, written by Zampano, which is the body of the work. So essentially, you are reading a story about a man reading a story and following the two in tandem. But its a bit more complicated than that, because the story Johnny has found which is written by Zampano, is actually an over the top, study of a film which does not exist, which in `Blair Witch-esqe¿ fashion, tells the story of a family that moves into a house, only to find out that the house is bigger on the inside than it is on the outside. Much bigger.The complexity of the stories is further multiplied by the fact that half of it is the work you are reading, and the other half told through foot notes, which in turn have their own foot notes, apendixes, drawings and exhibits which they reference. In a most unusual way, through poetry and prose, you are taken in a bizarre ride through the most unusual house you ever heard of. The study providing so much detail about this movie that you essentially feel like you have watched the movie yourself¿oh, and I should probably mention, Zampano is blind. It begs the question, how did he see the movie to begin with? Or was it even a movie?Prepare yourself to tear this book apart and truly interact with this book. This book reads in pages, columns, spirals, upside down, single words, geometrical and asymmetrical arrangements, footnotes, poetry, letters, sideways, on diagonals¿upside down on diagonals and hanging. You will find yourself going from page seven to page four hundred and back only to be forced to go back to the end before you can continue with the beginning. It is a book that covers so many writing styles and approaches it actually may test some people¿s patience, but it pays off in the richness of its characters and the thrill the actual story provides, at some points forcing you to do your own detective work and not leave a single foot note unscratched regardless of how unimportant it may seem.If you are tired of reading books from cover to cover, if you ever really wanted to engross yourself in a book, this is the book for you."
1090,House of Leaves,038560310X,Mark Z. Danielewski,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"One of the best books I have ever read. This book was recommended to me as 'the scariest book I'll ever read' - there are indeed some parts that are creepy, but this is definitely no easy-reading thriller, and the book goes way beyond just trying to scare you. The opening warns you about the possibility of nightmares if you keep reading, and while I did not exactly experience nightmares, there were a few times I woke up from sleep after a late-night read realizing in near delirium that I am deliberating the contents and meaning of the book in my sleep. A must read, but not while you have important business to take care of. This book will affect you."
1090,House of Leaves,038560310X,Mark Z. Danielewski,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Veronica23,"House of Leaves is a book for those who truly love to think and read. As the novel progresses, there are times when the reader has to figure out how they will go about reading. I loved having to figure out that I needed a mirror to read certain texts. I felt proud of myself when I figured out that I had to read certain parts of the book in a different order to understand what it meant. 
The story itself is fascinating, even without the puzzle-like presentation. The idea of an ever-growing house that becomes a character itself reminds me a little of The Fall of the House of Usher and House of the Seven Gables. While I love reading longer novels, I know many would find the length and effort to decipher some of the text off-putting. It does take a while to read, so if it was for a book club I'm not sure people would have time to read it within shorter periods. Too long for a rainy day, as well. 
Overall, it has become one of my favorite books, and I certainly recommend it to anyone who listens."

First, I hate that Dr. Scarpetta's lover, Mark, had been killed somewhere in between the last book and this one. Although this is a crime/murder book, I enjoyed the brief moments of romance. Second, although they knew who the killer was in the end and the case was basically solved, the killer was not actually found and is still at large in the end. With all the twists and turns and things that transpired in the book (corruption within the justice system, specifically in the ME's office), the ending did complete the story for me. They got to the bottom of who was involved and why things happened. I suppose that to chase the killer at that point would just be extra pages of writing that was not really suspenseful anymore. After reading the first three books in this series, I was just surprised that the killer was not found or killed in the end. Cornwell took a different path than in her first three books. Overall, this is an excellent book. I really enjoy Patricia Cornwell. I love how scientifically accurate she is. With an understanding of anatomy, physiology, and chemistry, Patricial Cornwell writes at a higher level that keeps me interested. Her books don't just appeal to an elementary level. Yet, I think that she explains things well enough that a person without a scientific background would understand the tests and findings presented in the book."

I was ready for Zoey to save the world by the 5th book. I'm glad Zoey only has one guy now because it was getting pretty tiring of reading about her teenage anxiety over three guys when the world is at stake. Hopefully the authors will wrap this up soon. I personally dont want to read how the heroine postponed the big war for another book again, it's a waste of money. Somebody please tell me when the FINAL book comes out so I can just finish this already, it's taking up too much time and honestly, I've forgotten everything about the series just waiting to find out what happens next...."

The last two books......barely readable. This series has drug on for far to long and the quality of writing continues to decline. My recommendation...if you haven't started reading this series then don't begin. If you have already starting the series and curiosity forces you to read onward then go ahead, but don't read with any real expectation - you'll be more than sorely disapointed. I do believe I can say that this is my final read of the House of Night series."
1094,My ??ntonia,1583485090,Willa Cather,Barnes and Noble,3.8,JSAlex000,"Since contemporary novels seldom draw me in and retain my interest past the first 60 pages, I sometimes pursue the bookstore for quality classic literature that I have yet to read. Thanks B&N for including Willa Cather's My Antonia in your Classic Series. Although relatively well-educated and well-read, I discovered this novel when browsing in-store. Cather's story-telling style and vivid descriptions transported me to a different time and place while her character development prompted me to continue reading. The quality of the story made it a page-turner and one of the two novels I have enjoyed reading most in the last 10 years."
1094,My ??ntonia,1583485090,Willa Cather,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Emilsay,"This dynamic novel does what too many contemporary novels fail to do- it portrays heartbreakingly authentic characters without drowning the reader in nonessential details.  This style of writing allows the story to become personal to the reader as he or she subconsciously fills the unexpressed components with his or her own unique thought process.  As the principal character discovers his own personal ""patria"" {home, or rather, home of the heart} the reader cannot help but to reflect upon their own ""patria"".  Perhaps this, out of many other contributing factors, was the most essential element in creating this American masterpiece.  With a flawlessly imperfect setting and ruggedly realist situations, Miss Cather's writing simply jumps off the page and captures the very mind, heart, and soul of the reader."
1094,My ??ntonia,1583485090,Willa Cather,Barnes and Noble,3.8,book-a-holick,"I will read this book over and over, every 5 years or so. The writing style (may I please call it lyrical?) is beautiful, separate and apart from the story-line. And the story-line complements the style. I was never bored. I never felt hurried reading this. I was sorry when I got to the end of the book. It is an experience, a journey, with a satisfactory ending, totally unexpected, but 'just right'. I learned a lot about this time period, but mostly, I fell in love with the characters and the story. And I keep musing about what might come next if the author had kept writing..."
1095,"Life As We Knew It (Last Survivors, #1)",0152061548,Susan Beth Pfeffer,Barnes and Noble,4.2,A_IS_AMAZING,"Oh my gosh; Life As We Knew It is one of my favorite books ever! This book is about a 16-year-old girl named Miranda who lives a normal life for a teenager. Everything is going well in her life, and it¿s all good. But all of this changes one night when a meteor hits the moon and knocks it closer in orbit to the Earth. After the meteor crashes, the ¿normal¿ way of life completely changes for everyone. There are catastrophes all around the world, like sickness, food shortages, and many natural disasters. Miranda has to let go of almost everything that she is used to, and she and her family have to struggle every day just to survive. I really love this book because it is written in Miranda¿s diary entries and it felt so real. Sometimes, I even felt like I was struggling along with the characters in the story. The only thing that disappointed me a little was the ending. But oh well, the rest of the book was great!"
1095,"Life As We Knew It (Last Survivors, #1)",0152061548,Susan Beth Pfeffer,Barnes and Noble,4.2,acsimps,"The story is centered around sixteen-year-old Miranda's life after a meteor crashes into the Moon. Life as they knew it would never be the same. The collision pushes the Moon closer to Earth and causes tidal waves, earthquakes, volcanoes, etc.Thousands are dead within the first 24 hours and the numbers just keep rising as the book continues. Power outages as well as food, water, and fuel shortages all create a platform for the chaos that ensues.

The story is told through journal entries where Miranda describes her life and the fate of her town over the course of a year. Miranda is living with her mother and two brothers (one older and one younger). Her father and his new pregnant wife live in another state (which is a cause for concern for Miranda throughout the story).

To be honest the book is sort of scary in a way. It portrays a fairly realistic glimpse of how people would react if food and resources were suddenly scarce. For most people who read this book, this realistic portrayal will be what makes them love it. The constant death and destruction soon left me feeling depressed whenever I picked the book up. 

This book was pretty good. It has a good message behind it: ""Appreciate what you have, because tomorrow it could be gone."" But it was also kind of depressing. I recommend you flip through this one before you buy it. I will probably read the second and third books when I get around to it so I guess I liked it enough to do that. I hope this review is helpful! :)

There was excellent character development and you couldn't help but to fall in love with the main characters. I usually don't like it when authors change the POV but Sparks made it work and I enjoyed the different views and stories. I also like how no one was portrayed as a hunky male heroine or a damsel in distress, this was a believable book about love. Thank you for sharing this book with the world"

After I read this book, I think it is the most faithful and satisfying English version. The translator understood Lao Tzu completely and never gave excess transcendental meanings.

1101,Change of Heart,0743496744,Jodi Picoult,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"Ms. Picoult knows how to pick them. She takes a topic and truly makes you think. I wished at times to have Shay's perspective but then this book probably wouldn't have been so powerful. The different view points got a lot across and I was so enthralled with this book. It tested the limits of even my beliefs but I realized that is what she wanted to do. She wants to make you think about where you are and have you come to your own conclusion. She never says what is right or wrong and that's why I come back to this author time and again.
Maggie had to deal with the faith she had and a client who really didn't want help. He had things figured out just wanted to go through with them. Father Michael say things that even he wasn't sure were happening. Lucius, the cell mate next to Shay, was shocked by all that he saw. June doing her best to deal with the deaths of her loved ones wasn't sure she could accept the one thing that could keep her life going.
This is one book that will keep you turning pages from every point of view. It does test boundaries but like every other book I have read by her truly makes you think. This is definitely going on my list of favorites for just how open she is with all sides of the issue. I can say I am not for the death penalty but I can see in which instances it might be the only way. Ms. Picoult really does her work and it shows on each and every page."

I am now reading ""The Lifegaurd"" and so far it's great.Sam's letters to Jennifer was a good read. I read it in two sittings and it kept my attention the whole time. I thought it had a good story line and I enjoyed to two love stories.I believe the story could have been played out more. But you can tell it was a get to the point story. I wouldn't surprise me if Mr. Patterson wrote it over the weekend.I recommend this book to someone who is taking a long flight or isn't a avid reader, because it is such a good short read. Not a disappointment,"
1103,Sam's Letters to Jennifer,0446613347,James Patterson,Barnes and Noble,4.2,sendy_s,"If you like a good love story, then Sam's Letters to Jennifer is the story you're looking for. It gives two love stories from a grandmother and granddaughter. It all happens in the summer in Lake Geneva. Jennifer the main character of the book leaves her job in Chicago to go to Lake Geneva where her grandmother, Sam, lives. A family friend found Sam on the floor unconscious. Jennifer has been very close to her grandmother; it's like if she was her best friend. Jennifer feels lost because she doesn't want to lose her grandmother like she did her husband, Danny.
This novel is different from any other novels because it has a lot of feeling to it as well as imagery. A good example of the imagery the book has is in page 102, ""A cooling breeze gusted under a hazy sun, and the air was a perfect seventy-five degrees."" I can really picture the way it would be out. It has a good story to it, and gives you two sides of love stories. Some of the surprise moments in this novel are when Jennifer finds letters to her from Sam. She reads them little by little while Sam is in the hospital. In one of the letters it tells Jennifer how Sam will be telling her secrets nobody ever knew about her. The first letter told Jennifer how Sam never really loved Charles, Jennifer's grandfather. Sam goes into detail how she met Charles. He was a gentleman at first but the 3rd day of their honeymoon Charles slapped Sam. Sam left everything for him and he slapped her, she felt like running away. Sam calmed down and told him next time he raises his hand to her she'll leave. After that nothing was the same, Charles was moody and always was working. Sam also says ""These letters aren't just about my life, Jen; they're about yours."" She wants to get Jennifer to move on and feel better. Sam tells Jennifer that only because Danny is dead doesn't mean she should shut love out of her life. This book has a good story to it.
I enjoyed reading the book Sam's Letters to Jennifer. I usually don't read books but this book I am almost done with. It has a lot of imagery to it, tone and feeling. It makes you think about life and all the good things it has to it."

I want every cent of my money back.  This book was absolutely horribly written.  Instead of actual insight into Christian's life and thoughts,  we got a poorly written rewrite of the very first FSOG. I wouldn't have minded so much if the book wasn't verbatim. It's like reading from a history book ad nauseum.  It just went on and on.  I couldn't even finish the book. B&N should really consider refunding this book to any and everyone who has purchased it. This book was a halfhearted attempt to breathe new life into a franchise that is already dead.  You had a good run with FSOG,  now let's see what else you can do.  And don't get me started on that travesty of a movie and is horrible cast.

James,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"Yes, the book is very repetitive and there is a lot of texts that are word for word from the Fifty Shades of Greybook...but why wouldn't there be? I knew before I read this book to expect to be rereading events and words from the first. That being said...it was still a great view into Christian's world present and past. Sex scenes were still good but not as good as from Ana's point of view, but I also expected that. What I wanted from this book it delivered. I want to see Christian develop, learning a new way to think, feel, and behave. His dreams gave an amazing insight into his childhood and his thoughts gave us a good hard look into his relationship with Elena (bleh). It seems that he was already addressing his past with her in a new light. I thought that he didn't revise his thinking until their final meeting in Fifty Shades Free. All-in-all I think it was a fun read, if a bit repetitive, but I would read it again...in fact I'm starting again now!"
1104,"Grey (Fifty Shades, #4)",1101946342,E.L. James,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"I was excited to read Christian's point of view. And it was good. However, 70% of the book reverberates word for word the Fifty Shades of Grey book. I understand that there is going to be similarities but I would have preferred more of his thoughts than an entire replay of the first book. The end of the book was good because it is his thoughts only and new. I think his view on all 3 books could have been summed up in one book if it wasn't for so much redundancy of the first book."

I loved DUNE personally, but DUNE was something that in my opinion happens once in a lifetime. It was such a mastery of all the topics touched upon in the novel and it brought together many concepts that should be lived through everyday life. Dune Messiah on the other hand is still an amzing novel. It however is made to show the imperfect sides of our beloved Paul so we constantly push it to the side. It truly leads up to the events of the next book and is needed to bridge the gap. stop hating."

Dune Messiah, while short, was excellent - even moreso when read immediately following the Paul of Dune installment.  Best part was the return of Duncan Idaho, in any form.  Interesting to see the Guild's involvement in the conspiracy when you consider how Norma Cenva might have viewed the collusion.  Recommended read."

1106,The Great Divorce,0006280560,C.S. Lewis,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"CS Lewis is an extremely talented individual and I think The Great Divorce is a perfect example of his gift and his craft. He has taken the subject of Heaven and Hell, a subject that it usually 'black and white,' and had added several different shades of gray. It's as though he wants the subject matter to be attainable to his readers. He has created characters that are real and believeable - not only because of his descriptive nature but because you may know any one of those characters. This book really makes you think and it leaves you with a new perspective. I strongly recommend this book. It's a great, quick read."
1106,The Great Divorce,0006280560,C.S. Lewis,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"Ever observant and insightful, Lewis has taken mankind's major shortcomings and embodied them in a group of ghosts from Hell.  Each of the doomed spirits is given the opportunity to shake off the chains of purgatory and respond to the invitation given by the heavenly host to 'come and feed'; in turn, each ghost finds one excuse or another why they cannot possibly do so.  Through the eyes of the narrator, we witness those who hold themselves back because of fear, pride, selfishness, cynicism, ignorance, and blindness.  Ultimately, Lewis' story hails individual choice as the chief determinant of where we will belong in the eternities: 'no soul that seriously and constantly desires joy will ever miss it.'  Whether a warning to or a reflection on society, the book stimulates thought and forces the reader to look inward at their own weaknesses.  Far from being pessimistic, however, the book leaves us with the notion that change, while perhaps difficult and even painful, is indeed possible.  Lewis gives us a small glimpse of how the celestials might view and value important qualities such as joy, freedom, forgiveness, charity, and love.  In the end, we are reminded that to live in a celestial environment, one must forego the telestial perspective."

Then, the opportunity to read it again arose when I was a senior and I fell in love with it. It's a simple book that deals with the not-so-simple topics of heaven and hell. This book, written by an amazing critic and author, is one to read and understand and think about for years to come. Please take my advice and read this book! You won't regret it."

Kelly works hard so that she and her spouse can live a better life than she did as a kid, but her husband Steve lost his job and seems not to care about anything even her.  Reporter Ayinde is married to a basketball superstar Richard who she though was faithful to her, but now knows he is just like every other jock, using the wrong head to break his vows................................

Can this quartet provide the safety net and support that each one desperately needs at a critical time in their prospective lives?.........................    LITTLE EARTHQUAKES is a strong insightful character study that runs along four subplots that rotate between the women, but intersects as each tries to be there for the others.  The story line hooks family drama readers from the start as the tales seem real, touching, and somewhat amusing though serious.  The key cast comes across as friends and neighbors helping one another cope.

So much so, that i immediatly went out and bought a 2nd copy of it and handed it over to my then-pregnant friend.I think it's a very good and accurate, without being frightening, view of in-laws, pregnancy, and life after childbirth."

This book was about pregnancy, childbirth, raising an infant and losing an infant to SIDS. As a breeding woman in my 20s, I was entralled."

read them. Then there are books where you read it, and you think WOW what did I just experience, and it stays with you... 
This book gave me that reaction and then some! It's the type of book where the author got everything right.
I want to tell everybody that I know to read this book so they can experience what I just did!"
1110,"Maybe Someday (Maybe, #1)",0000000000,Colleen Hoover,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Kristas_Dust_Jacket,"I am not quite sure if a book has ever affected me in such a way as Maybe Someday did. Colleen Hoover is a master at reaching inside of me, grabbing my heart and squeezing it with her beautiful words. She's done it before, and, I don't know. I shouldn't be surprised by it anymore. And, yet, when I read the final word, I sat here blinking my eyes, my mouth opening and closing like a damn fish, completely blown away. 

Sydney and Ridge catch each others' eye across the courtyard of their apartment complex when he plays his guitar on his balcony and she sits on hers and makes up lyrics. Ridge asks for her help in giving words to his songs, and a friendship is born. Just in time too, because when Sydney's boyfriend cheats on her, she has to move out, and it turns out Ridge's apartment has an empty bedroom. The close proximity allows them to continue writing music together, but it also monumentally complicates things. You see, Ridge has a serious girlfriend, and his feelings for Sydney are now blurring the lines. 

I was thrown for a loop nearly right away when Ridge reveals a secret he's been keeping from Sydney (I won't spoil it for you!). It affects the entire story in an incredible way, and was probably my favorite part of the whole book. How this secret is woven into the musical part of Ridge's and Sydney's story was utterly beautiful and a little heartbreaking at times. When it was first revealed, I was totally shocked, but once I finished the book, I don't see how this book would've been even half as amazing as it was without it. 

It was Sydney really for whom my heart broke the most. Ridge was amazing. He's funny, charming, intelligent, artistic and chivalrous. He takes Sydney under his wing, protects her from her douchey ex and gives her a real purpose. How could she not fall completely and utterly in love with him? And, yet, he's been in a relationship for five years with a disgustingly wonderful girl named Maggie, and has no designs to break things off with her. Being around the two of them absolutely kills her, but it's the lesser of two evils, as far as she sees it. Because her world without Ridge in it at all would be even worse. 

Can you imagine what that would be like? Sydney is constantly denying herself what she wants more than anything in life. And to make matters even worse, sometimes Ridge makes it seem like he wants her too. Talk about head games. But, they share this incredible connection through music that is impossible to ignore. 

Unfortunately, the fact that they have a harder and harder time ignoring that connection and the beautiful music they make together, causes the worst heartache ever. Because Maggie also has a secret, and when that is revealed, it changes things for Sydney. She has to come to terms with the nature of hers and Ridge's relationship and face the fact that she might never be able to have him the way she wants him. 

Sydney is stronger than I could ever be. She makes tough choices and tries to make the best of an increasingly difficult situation. Even though Ridge is the main link in this love triangle, it's absolutely impossible to be mad at him. You think you would, right? Nope. And then there's Maggie. You really, really want to hate her. But, you just can't. She's a genuinely nice person. 

Maybe Someday is told in dual POV, so we get the benefit of all the angst from both Sydney's and Ridge's heads. The language pretty clean; the sex very minimal. Although there's almost no sex, the passion and sexual tension between Ridge and Sydney made my head want to explode. It was That. Good. And then there's the end. OMG - THE END. Completely, utterly, totally, wonderfully P-E-R-F-E-C-T. 

I need you to go out today and read this book. Then, come back here and tell me that you get what I've been trying to say. That you understand now why I'm telling you how amazing it is. I can't wait to hear from you."

1112,"Anne of the Island (Anne of Green Gables, #3)",0553213172,L.M. Montgomery,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"As old friends come out of the picture and new ones come in, Anne Shirley clings on to the days of the past.  But as old friendships become far more than friendships, she¿s not so sure she can.  From young frivolous, little Anne to grown up woman going to college, Anne Shirley has changed a lot over the years.  She wants to hang on to the past, but as old friends marry off and new ones come into the picture, Anne firmly believes that she has finally reached adulthood.  But, is she really happy?  	I really like the story plot in Anne of the Island because it¿s a sweet story and many parts of it remind me of special memories that I had.  To me, the plot of this story is like a winding path.  Whenever I think it¿s going uphill, it¿s going downhill, whenever I think it¿s turning right, it¿s turning left.  There are many unexpected, yet subtle, turns in this book.  It really makes me wonder what will happen in the next book of the series.    	The characters in this book are so real, so defined, it seems to me, that they could never be anything but themselves.  This book plants very firm pictures of the characters in my head, so they look very different to me when I see a picture on the cover or something else.  This is probably because of the many great descriptions shown in this book.  I wouldn¿t change one single character in this book, they¿re just so unique and special.  	The writing style of this book is very old-timey and professional.  Many times while reading, I find myself thinking, ¿Huh?¿  And that¿s a good thing  I learned new words and it challenged me.   The language in this book is very poetic.  There are many metaphors and similes, and it creates a mood for the reader.   If you ever decide you want to read this book, I think you¿ll really like it, I know I did.  It is the third book in L.M. Montgomery¿s wonderful series Anne of Green Gables.  Just like the two before it, it is a very fun and unique book.    A. Ambler"

The movies are good, as well, except for the very sensitive (like me) you may not want to watch the last one; it takes place during a war and it broke my heart to watch all the suffering even if it is just a movie."
1112,"Anne of the Island (Anne of Green Gables, #3)",0553213172,L.M. Montgomery,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"Anne of the Island is a wonderful book.  It takes you back to another place and time and has delightful characters that are very easy to relate to.  I felt myself experiencing the highs and lows that Anne and the other characters were going through.  It is my favorite book of the series, probably because it is the most romantic.  It is an incredible book!!"
1113,Thus Spoke Zarathustra,0140047484,"Friedrich Nietzsche, Walter Kaufmann",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"The most important aspect of this book is to keep an open mind.  Nietzsche is presenting the reader with the character of Zarathustra, yet we must keep in mind that the book is Zarathustra's journey as well as our own.  At the point of Zarathustra's maturation the reader will have completed the journey as well.  An excellent read, this book is filled with metaphors and aphorisms that may take a second read to fully comprehend.  However, I highly recommend this book to any one who even comes to this page.  This is the culmination of Nietzsche's work as he himself said."
1113,Thus Spoke Zarathustra,0140047484,"Friedrich Nietzsche, Walter Kaufmann",Barnes and Noble,4.2,unheimlich27,"Clancy Martin (the 'translator') pretends that this is an original 'from scratch' translation: it is not. For the most part it is not much more than a very light revision of the Thomas Common translation (e.g removing archaic verb-endings and pronouns), occasionally enriched with renderings lifted straight from either Hollingdale or Kaufmann (e.g. 'lie around lurking and spy and smirking' - is Kaufmann's work). Plagiarism aside, however, or perhaps precisely because of it, it is perhaps the best available translation of Zarathustra, - even if in one or two places it is let down by some rather silly renderings (though at least they are Clancy's own work)."
1113,Thus Spoke Zarathustra,0140047484,"Friedrich Nietzsche, Walter Kaufmann",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"This book educates us on the reality of 'eternal recurrence' and how Nietzsche would hope that someone would one day rise and personify themselves to be (or live) like his Zarathustra but to follow on their own path to reach this goal. The other lesson learned here is that solitude for each individual in this world wouldn't be a such bad idea from time to time. In fact, that may be the divine secret on how to reach a certain goal expressed in this book. Ubermensch"

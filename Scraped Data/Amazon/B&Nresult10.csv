910,"Old Man's War (Old Man's War, #1)",0765348276,John Scalzi,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"Old mans war has to be the best book that i have ever read. I stumbled apon it in the airport on one of my journeys across the country the last summer. The book was marveing and i found it to be so interesting that i couldn't put it down. The story of John Perry giving up his 'old' body for a new military green one to fight for the CDF. As the book moves on you will became attached to the characters as they went on missions against alien species bent on destruction of mankind and the aquisition of planets that bare natural resources. I won't tell about the book because it would give away the book, but i will tell you that if your a sci-fi/action&adventure lover that this book is definently for you! Be warned that this book and the sequels to this book(The Ghost Bridgades, The last Colony) are extreme in detail to violence/gore and love/sex.    But all in all one of my favorites along with the sequels.                !!!Enjoy Them!!!"
910,"Old Man's War (Old Man's War, #1)",0765348276,John Scalzi,Barnes and Noble,4.4,harstan,"When he turned seventy-five, earthling John Perry visits the grave site of his wife of forty-two years Kathy interred in an Arizona cemetery.  He reflects how much he misses her, how he hates coming here, and that her last words dealt with finding vanilla as she was making pancakes when she stroked to death.  With nothing to keep him here, John abruptly decides to join the Colonial Defense Force struggling to defend or annex other worlds in deadly competition with alien races for control of the few hospitable planets.......................    As a recruit, John receives standard gear to include a much younger healthier body that is beyond the ability of most non government citizens to buy except the affluent.  Like his brothers and sisters in arms, he bonds with them as they are his family and his hope to survive one skirmish after another in many cases against superior aliens.  As his comrades die and collateral damage devastate civilian population, John begins questioning the worth war that enables a few to economically gain a lot at the cost of others even as he begins to ponder whether he is still human....................    Paying homage to Heinlein (Starship Trooper the book not the movie), John Scalzi provides a tense anti-war military science fiction thriller that will leave fans pondering what is war good for.  Readers will also wonder about who benefits from scientific advances and military operations and what actually a human is as science changes Homo sapiens.  The story line is action-packed once John enlists as the audience get inside his head while he goes from ¿youthful¿ awe to experienced cynic.  OLD MAN¿S WAR is a terrific tale of a belligerent future in space..........................    Harriet Klausner"
910,"Old Man's War (Old Man's War, #1)",0765348276,John Scalzi,Barnes and Noble,4.4,LaKitteh,"When I saw this book compared to 'Starship Troopers', I was skeptical.  As a lifelong sci-fi reader I can honestly say that not many books can be compared to Robert A. Heinlein books... but this book, this ENTIRE series of books, is the exception!  Once I picked it up I was unable to put it back down.  Imagine a future where the OLD are encouraged to go into the army while the young stay behind... the lure?  To be young again.  Follow along as John Perry leaves behind Earth and old age, to be a soldier for the Colonial Defense Forces."
911,Gerald's Game,0831727527,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,3.8,JessLucy,"Super scary and disturbing novel! This book starts out with a husband and wife at their cabin in a remote location. What started as sexy fun and games quickly turns terrifying. I was mad at King about the how the issue of the stray dog was resolved; he didn't do anything wrong! Anyway, this book truly scared me...after reading it one night I woke up in the early hours to use the bathroom and I was so spooked I made my German Shepherd come to the bathroom with me! I couldn't believe the ending; King really surprised me with this one! I would also recommend: The Stand, The Dark Tower Series (especially Wizard and Glass), Needful Things, and The Eye of The Dragon. You may also like the novels of Dean Koontz, especially the older ones (Whispers, Watchers, Night Chills, Phantoms, and Cold Fire)."
911,Gerald's Game,0831727527,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Anonymous,"This is the kind of Stephen King novel I absolutely love. Gerald's Game is a story of psychological horror, with the merest hint of something supernatural (or not) only at the very periphery of the story. At the heart of this story, however, are the very real horrors of this world, particularly the ones from our past that continue to haunt us in very real (albeit unconscious ways). This book stands alongside Cujo, Misery, and the early Bachman books to name but a few. This is where Stephan King excels. He knows what scares us, and this one is truly frightening."
911,Gerald's Game,0831727527,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Sean_Patrick_R,"Without spoiling anything from the story, and making this long, I can only say this is a book that makes me question the mind of the author. Simply to think all of this up and put it down in writing is absolutely scary. Partially from what happens before the Main Character and her Father, the way her entire ordeal is handled, and I guess just every aspect of it. 

I have always been aware that Stephen King is an amazing writer. Now I am starting to realize just how creative he can be. You'll feel chained up in the room with her."

Great mystery! Lots of Laughs!
The characters are sooo real! Just when you think you have an odd ball family, in comes Stephanie Plum! I love, Grama! I love all the characters!
In this world of ever unemployment and stepping out of your comfort zone, it goes to show you that you can recreate yourself to keep a roof over your head, while the bullets fly over too!
Start with One for the Money if you can! But be sure and buy the next two or three books because you will get done with one and want the next book! Of course, You can jump in anytime with these books because Ms E. catches you up in ever book. She does it differently each time and so when you are reading the series you don't get bored with the reintroductions.
This is great for the gals, but I find the guys are laughing and enjoying it too! Just start reading 'em. Soon you will want to read and collect them all!!! I am!!! lol
Let the fun begin!!!"

913,The Joy of Cooking,0684818701,"Irma S. Rombauer, Marion Rombauer Becker, Ethan Becker",Barnes and Noble,4.7,eeminy on LibraryThing,"After much use of both, I have to admit I don't like Ethan Becker's recently revised edition as well as the elder Rombauer generation's old standby. The new _Joy_ has more international cuisine and fancy stuff, and I'm glad for a few of the healthier/updated recipes, but there are just as many new or updated recipes that don't work as well, and there are too many missing classics. I find the new edition just isn't a kitchen bible the way the old _Joy_ has always been. The new _Joy_ is a very good cookbook, but if I could only have one, I'd choose the earlier edition in a heartbeat."

914,"The Forever War (The Forever War, #1)",0060510862,Joe Haldeman,Barnes and Noble,4.3,DominicMichael,"The year is 1997, and mankind is locked in a cosmic war with an enemy it's never seen.  First, let's set the stage: twelve years before, scientists discovered the collapsar jumps, naturally occurring wormholes that allow instantaneous access to the stars.  Fly in one end at just the right angle, at just the right speed, and pop out at some distant corner of space.  What roads were to Rome and ships were to the British, so now are collapsars to Earth.  Whoever controls them rules the known galaxy-and it seems other intelligent beings besides those on Earth understand this simple fact, as well.

So begins The Forever War, a novel chronicling the story of elite soldier William Mandella through humanity's conflict with an alien race known as the Tauran.  The author, Joe Haldeman, accomplishes a feat with his first novel that doesn't seem possible.  He's written an epic adventure story in less than three hundred pages.  What's more, the world he creates is so believable that after a short while, you don't even question the techno jargon anymore.  Instead, you find yourself blindly accepting all the rules and also thinking of new ways to fight with the tools at hand.  This complete immersion into a foreign reality is one the book's greatest strengths, and lays a strong foundation that seems to be missing in a lot of modern sci-fi.  It's refreshing to see science as the cornerstone for science fiction.  The author obviously had schooling in some of these areas to handle them so convincingly.  And if he didn't, he sure fakes it damned well.

At its heart, though, The Forever War is a war story.  ""Tonight,"" begins the first chapter, ""we're going to show you eight silent ways to kill a man.""  It soon becomes clear that the 'actors' in the demonstration video are convicted criminals who are actually being executed for the sake of teaching new recruits how to kill a man with a kidney punch.  Cute.  There's little outrage among the men and women, though, which is a hint at what kind of world you're entering.  This is a world where men and women are forcibly conscripted into an organization called the United Nations Exploratory Force, or UNEF, and sent into battle.  This is a world were 50% casualty rates simply during training are the norm, not the exception.  This is a world where your superiors fire live ordinance at you during drills and execute you for insubordination.  This is a brutal world.  Accept that going in.

It's this inhumanity, though, that truly gives The Forever War its soul.  Haldeman, based on his own real life experience in Vietnam, gives us a front row seat to the savagery of war and the lengths unchecked bureaucracies are willing to go in order to 'win.'  His subtle, concise writing style adds to a gripping narrative that conveys the power of his themes without patronizing the reader by banging them over the head with a proverbial shovel.  This is a story that truly gives the reader an honest impression of what armed conflict is really like, minus all the glitz and glitter and rhetoric.  In these uncertain times, with America engaged in places like Iraq, it reminds you why war is always the option of last resort.

914,"The Forever War (The Forever War, #1)",0060510862,Joe Haldeman,Barnes and Noble,4.3,RJ45,"This is quite possibly the best book I have ever read.  I say this having read the book back in high school, and then having reread it several time since.  Joe Haldeman very effectively tells a story that takes place in the future yet speaks to a modern world where soldiers fight in wars that they don't really care about using skills that are largely alien to their basic personalities.  These same soldiers then come home to a world that has seemingly changed (in the book, the world really has changed) and must choose to live in that world, or go back to do what they detest."
914,"The Forever War (The Forever War, #1)",0060510862,Joe Haldeman,Barnes and Noble,4.3,JCarter,"Originally published before Star Wars, this work is based on science fact. Man is unable to go faster than light speed, time moves forward on Earth but not for those in space. These things lead to soldiers fighting a war lasting thousands of years on Earth and only a few years where they are.
     Civilization on Earth evolves beyond what soldiers on the front can grasp. but beyond that are still the horrors that soldiers face in battle.

     For me this is the definitive science fiction work. Having written Mr. Joe Haldeman several times he had given me the inspiration to write science fiction and the encouragement to do so. I would place this book alongside Red Badge of Courage."

916,Reading Lolita in Tehran,0812971060,Azar Nafisi,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,"People have complained about this book for numerous   reasons, for everything from Nafisi being a propagandist   for the Bush administration to it being too 'boring' for   focusing on literary criticism in detail when it should just   be a narrative memoir.        First of all, this book is a book written by a woman   who is passionate about books - in essence, a book about   books.  Nafisi was a literary professor at a university in   Tehran before her expulsion during the ascent of the   regime/revolution.   Her sobering, first-hand experiences   living during the Regime in Iran, coupled with her   unquenchable penchant for literature, drove her to write   this memoir, and the result is a triumphant weaving of the   two - current events in the Middle East and timeless   Western literature playing off each other as described by   an Iranian woman passionate about freedom, women's   rights and¿Western literature.  This is hardly propaganda.    What it is is a memoir about literature and the powerful   joy it brings, even in tumultuous times in the Middle East   during bombing raids and wearing the veil mandatorily,   and a consequent first-hand look into the lifestyle in such   a predicament by an author who, while candid and   completely honest in her condemnation of the totalitarian   regime she was subjected to, does not once act bitter or   caustic about her ordeals, or write about her impressions   in a way that is at all manipulative or self-righteous.   Any   'human' emotions or a opinions Nafisi does express   simply reflect the fact that this is, after all, a memoir - a   personal account of things that could be written in   otherwise impersonal works (i.e. current events books and   literary anthologies).   'Reading Lolita In Tehran' gives us   an insight into both famous books and modern   politics/history, but through the less-formal account of a   woman who, although isn't treating it formally, knows an   awful darn lot about both.  And she happens to be a really   interesting person and a really good writer."
916,Reading Lolita in Tehran,0812971060,Azar Nafisi,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Viejo,"This book is beautifully written in the intimacy of Azar Nafisi's literary book club. The club is composed by seven Muslim women that just like Nafisi, open their heart and invite the reader to take a step into their life in the Islamic world. Each week they come into Nafisi's house unveiling their faces and freeing themselves from the restrictions of their society by reading and discussing tabooed subjects. In a sense, they find an escape to their real life problems in the fictitious plots of literary classics. It invites women of all ages around the world, to seek comfort for their own problems by submerging themselves in epic novels while standing up for their rights. This memoir is an  example of how literature can help us heal the wound of our past and how important it is to defend freedom of expression.

As a high school student, I consider this novel to be a great educational treasure. Not only does it create conscience on the empowerment of women and invites us to believe in gender equality, but it also teaches us about the different cultures and political issues in today's world. At the very same time it is also a book promoting Western literature that introduces us to the stories of each woman by relating it to the plot of  classical novels such as The Great Gatsby, Pride & Prejudice and Lolita. As one reads the novel, you become acquainted with each member of the group and have access to their most intimate but important feelings and opinions. I consider that this novel can change the perspective some men have about women, and encourage them to see them as equal. 

Nafisi is a woman to be admired. This book comes from her true life personal experiences in the battle towards spreading her love for knowledge in a restricted world. Reading Lolita in Tehran will touch the emotions of any reader, it will make us cry, laugh, but above all mostly think. For anyone interested in Literature, Politics, Anthropology  or that has ever been a book club member it is a must read. 

In my personal experience, the book opened my eyes towards life for women in the Islamic world. Although sometimes I found their experiences to have been heart breaking and intolerable, they also made me respect them much more than I did. I got to know the woman behind the Hijaab (Muslim veil), her culture and her life. 

 	The only recommendation I would give off when it comes to Reading Lolita in Tehran is that if you have read The Great Gatsby, Pride & Prejudice and Lolita it will be easier for you to understand the full context of the plot. The author constantly related the plots of these books to the experiences of the book club members. However, it is not something necessary. I had not read any of these books except for Pride and Prejudice and really enjoyed the book. Except that at times I wished I knew Lolita by heart to feel as if I understood each and every detail of the book."
916,Reading Lolita in Tehran,0812971060,Azar Nafisi,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Baomei,"A revelation of a revolution that promised a country the keys to heaven but gave its people the evils of hell instead. Nafisi tells her story eloquently on how she survived the upheavals of the revolution. Using her imaginative mind for fiction and her passion for literature, she brought a degree of comfort to the hearts of her students in the face of tyranny. Reading this book was a heartfelt experience of compassion and new found empathy for victims of an oppressive government."
917,"The Blade Itself (The First Law, #1)",0575079797,Joe Abercrombie,Barnes and Noble,4.4,DAY-READER,"First let me say that as you look at the reviews you will notice mr. Negative giving this book a bad review...I never respond to other reviews as they are entitled to thier own opinions. I must make a exception here because this book is just that awesome and deserves to be defended. Most of you may know me by now as i have wriiten alot of reviews and read 46 fantasy books a year...So when i say that Abercrombies First Blade is a diamond, a gem, one of the best wriiten fantasy epics of all time, Then you shouldnt take that too lightly. Mr. Negative probly gave Mr. R.R Martin a bad review.,(lol)...In short ""This book has it all. Great characters, its funny at times and most importantly you will remain excited throughout the entire series....RARELY do i find a book that i can say that about with the exception of ""A Song of Fire and Ice"""
917,"The Blade Itself (The First Law, #1)",0575079797,Joe Abercrombie,Barnes and Noble,4.4,MalcolmVardy,"True to form for a contemporary fantasy, The Blade Itself plunges us straight into an action scene, a desperate bid for survival and a literal cliffhanger. The mechanics were initially arresting to my cycnical take on novel craft, but Abercrombie pulls it off well. He is never verbose and always seems to come up with simple words that convey the greatest image.

Perhaps the biggest strength of the book, for me, is Abercrombie's use of voice and point of view. The principles have little idiosynracies of speech - sometimes action - which makes them instantly recognisable without a surfeit of speech tags (he said, she said.) There is the ""say one thing for Logan Ninefingers."" and ""you've got to be realistic"" of Logan the barbarian, the italicised thoughts of Inquisitor Glotka, always commenting dryly but giving nothing away to his interlocutors), and the preening narcissism of Jazal dan Luthar.

Logan and Glotka in particular are extremely strong memorable characters - at times pantomimic but great fun. Many of the characters are caricatures, broadly brushed and stock types. This in no way hinders the comedic elements of the book but occasionally distances the reader from full engagement with them.

The plot is at times lumbering, a slow coming together of the principle characters. There are elements of intrigue, detective work, sword and sorcery (shades of Gene Wolfe at times, particularly in the House of Questions scenes). Abercrombie creates a hotch-potch of parody and tribute that nevertheless has moments of brilliance. He is at his best with action and character but occasionally lulls into mediocrity.

Language is also a slight inconsistency. Often it is used effectively, particularly when he remembers the point of view. There are, hovever, some incongruities and a smattering of contemporary expletives that don't always fit the moment.

Whilst point of view is a definite strength in the book, I felt Abercrombie over did the changes of point of view. We often get a chapter from Logan's perspective followed by a shift to Glotka, then to Jezal, back to Logan, off to Ferro. I found myself being drawn into a character only to be spat out and forced into another induction. I would have prefferred a little more balance and pacing here.

Nevertheless there are great things in The Blade Itself, the odd sublime scene, cruel wit, and (most of the time) a deceptively simple and utterly effective use of language. It is a refreshing read and stands out from the heap of turgid mush that the genre has been spilling onto the bookshelves for the past few decades."
917,"The Blade Itself (The First Law, #1)",0575079797,Joe Abercrombie,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"The Blade Itself is by far one of the best fantasy novels I've read to date! Abercrombie has created a vivid world full of drama, epic battles, sprawling landscapes, magic and mystery. You won't find yourself weighed down by lenghty back-story or boring histories that is expected in this genre. The real gems of this book, however, are the terribly cynical characters. Abercombie stays away from the 'safe' fantasy characters we've come to expect. They are pessimistic, blunt, foul and offensive, and from the very beginning, you'll find yourself loving every one of them. I've bought this book for several of my friends as gifts, and have recommended it to countless more."
918,"The Arctic Incident (Artemis Fowl, #2)",0786851473,Eoin Colfer,Barnes and Noble,4.4,TeensReadToo,"I didn't discover the delight that is the Artemis Fowl series until a week ago, when I read ARTEMIS FOWL in one day. So, of course, I had to pick up a copy of THE ARCTIC INCIDENT right away, to see if it was as good as the first. It definitely is, and in my own humble opinion, I think I liked it even better than the first book. There are points throughout the book where Artemis, now thirteen, shows a softer, more vulnerable side that I truly enjoyed. Don't get me wrong, he's still an evil genius, but he's an evil genius with heart, and you can't help but love him. Now that Angeline Fowl is out of her depression, thanks to some fairy magic from Captain Holly Short, she's sent Artemis back to Saint Bartelby's School for Young Gentlemen in Ireland. Artemis is having quite a large amount of fun flumoxing the school's counselor, Dr. Po, when he gets an urgent message from Butler, his bodyguard/butler/majordomo--it seems that Artemis Fowl the First is alive in Russia, being held for ransom by the Russian Mafiya. Young Artemis, of course, immediately sets out to devise a scheme to rescue his father. It's been almost two years since Artemis Senior was last heard from, and his son is most eager to bring him home. Before he can work out a devious scheme, though, he's visited by none other than Captain Short and her superior, Commander Root, and brought down to Haven City and into Police Plaza. It seems the goblin triad, the B'Wa Kell, have a human counterpart aiding in their smuggling, and Artemis the Second is, quite justly I believe, suspected of being that human. The fairies soon realize, however, that this time Artemis Fowl isn't the bad guy in this problem. But now they'd like Artemis and Butler's help in figuring out who is behind the allaince between the goblins and the Mud Men--and Artemis is quite willing to help them out, in exchange for the fairies help in rescuing his father. What follows is an action-packed story of good versus evil below ground, with deceptions, backstabbing, and revenge taking center stage. As Holly, Root, Butler, and Artemis race to save Haven City from being destroyed, some of the same characters from the first book make appearances--Foaly, Mulch Diggums, Cudgeon, and Captain Trouble. There's also a new foe in THE ARCTIC INCIDENT, Opal Koboi, to be dealt with. I highly recommend the ARTEMIS FOWL series to anyone and everyone. Highly enjoyable, thoroughly entertaining, and not soon forgotten."

918,"The Arctic Incident (Artemis Fowl, #2)",0786851473,Eoin Colfer,Barnes and Noble,4.4,bookfreak54,"A year ago the child prot&#233;g&#233; Artemis Fowl took on the fairy underworld in a plot to restore his family fortune. This plot put the lives of his mother, his bodyguard, and all that was dear to him. But that was then and this is now. Artemis is a year older and has promise to go on the strait and narrow. He enrolled in one of Ireland's most premier colleges and now uses his talents to drive the psychologist to the brink of insanity. He almost put his greatest secrets behind him. The fairy people. He almost became normal. Well, as normal as a thirteen year old genius can be. But things don't stay the same for long. 

But one email is all it takes. It acted like a drop of water on a still pond. A simple email sent ripples in the once calm waters of his life. His father had been found. But getting would be no easy task. The Russian Mafia had gotten to him. At the same time the LEP (a fairy police unit) was doing a routine check-up on an abandon tunnel when they were attacked by goblins armed with illegal weapons. But that's not the bad part. They were powered by human batteries. So they naturally assumed that it was the only human who knew about the People's existence, Artemis Fowl.

The fairy people capture Artemis and his massive bodyguard named Butler and takes them underground for a typical police integration. They find him innocent but are left with a problem; whose behind this. Artemis decides to help them; but there's a catch. He wants their help getting his father back. After a major break in the case they send Butler to France to investigate a suspect. While Butler is in France they trace the email and get everything ready to go. In Russia everything goes wrong and when they go back underground everything's different. 

This amazing work of literary art is well written and will capture the imaginations of readers young and old. It is a captivating book for readers of all ages. You will be drawn into the story by the truly unique writing style of The New York Times Best-selling author Eoin Colfer. This book is full of twists and turns from the beginning to end. Even some of the most hard to please and easily board reader will be delighted by this masterpiece. And if you're very lucky you may find some similarities between you and him. Will Artemis save his father; read the book to find out."
919,The Shipping News,0743225422,Annie Proulx,Barnes and Noble,3.7,kimdep,"This is the story of Quoyle.. who is always the foil.. he was treated badly growing up, was severely emotionally abused throughout his marriage to a whorish nymphomaniac, and repeatedly got fired from his dead end job. So when his aunt suggests they move to Newfoundaland he picks up his children .. Bunny & Sunshine (love their names).. and moves. 

In Newfoundland he is re-created. He becomes successful at his job. He is respected by others. The town has it's own quirkiness so he & the family fit in well.

I liked the story a lot. To me it really reflects how our roots affect us in ways we don't even realize. I think it's really cool when a character discovers things about themselves through digging into their ancestry. The writing style is quick and easy to read. The dialogue is engaging as the town people speak with their unique accent. I enjoyed reading this story of self-discovery."
919,The Shipping News,0743225422,Annie Proulx,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Anonymous,"I can't imagine anyone not placing this book at the top of their Must Read list. The characters are real - not grand in stature - but so like the rest of us - not pretty, struggling, abandoned, but filled with a great desire to find a life. As a former newspaper woman, I especially like the way our hero narrows everything down to alliterative headlines. How could you not howl when the entire family is confined to a single motel room and the dog is farting up a storm in its sleep: Farts Fell Family of Four. You've got to love it."

    I wanted to read All the Bright Places because I am always interested in mental health books, especially ones dealing with suicide. As someone who has mental health issues, has had thoughts of suicide myself, and lost my father to suicide, it is a topic that is very important to me. I think that books like this can help people relate to someone who is depressed or thinking of suicide even if they have never had clinical depression, 




    In a society where everything is becoming all about instant gratification and what feels good in that moment, it is important to realistically address what happens when moods get dark and it feels like there is no way out. I think that it is important to learn how to love people that are in that situation and
 even if they are not normally your friend, if you see someone hurting, talk to them, be their friend, and it may make all of the difference in the world to them. It is also crucial to look at the times where a person may go through with suicide. Blame cannot be placed, you can't ask the what ifs and you have to learn how to let their memory be honored and stay alive and heal and keep living however you can. 




    All the Bright Places is smart shocking realistic and messy emotional. No holds barred with finch. He was the kind of character who amazed me at his kindness and broke my heart. I loved that he could help someone else and talk them down when he himself can't quit thinking about death and how it could be his escape. But he is also a person who lived life fully. He didn't conform to expectations and tried to see the beauty in life and take risks, chances and life hard. 




   Our other main character is Violet. Where I can connect with Finch on some levels, and admired him where I didn't understand or that wasn't my personality, I connected with Violet in others. She is a people pleaser, she is more withdrawn, and she is hurting deep inside, and tries to keep it hidden. The healing and growth on violet was undeniable watching her learn to accept loss and still remember and love those that have left her life was inspiring.  




     Finch is eccentric and troubled but also with a love for life even with thoughts of and plans for suicide torment him. Their reluctant friendship and camaraderie in meeting on that water tower, and Finch talking her down and not thinking less or correcting when people thought that it was Violet who saved Finch. He is persistent in being around her and trying to bring her out of her shell. They both have a lot to teach the other. 




    The ending is bold and raw. I couldn't believe the route that it took but think that it is eye opening and realistic. Not everything can be a happy ending, there are aspects to mental health that can't be fixed, and there is some pain that is inescapable. But I do like the hope that it does give us. That there are other ways, there is help out there, and there are friends in places we may never have thought to look. 








Bottom Line: Gritty, raw, emotional, powerful."
921,All the Bright Places,0385755880,"Jennifer Niven, ?????????? ??????????",Barnes and Noble,4.7,KikiD870,"This book was... amazing.  For heart wrenching novels, this is right up there with The Fault in Our Stars and Love and Other Unknown Variable, two of my favorite novels of 2014.  It touches the soul, it touches the heart, and leaves you reeling.  I started it in the morning and didn't put it down again until I had finished it.  And then I sat there drained.  It was so beautiful in its own way.  I love that this book recognizes that happy ever afters don't always happen in life.  Life is messy, sad, funny, loving, and every emotion in between.  There is love and there is loss.

Theo is the guy that no one really understands, including himself.  Even his two best friends seem to know him only on the most basic of levels.  His family is largely a group of people living separate lives and I frequently thought that his little sister Decca was the most together of them all.  He has had a pretty troubled past and he struggles to figure out who he is.  Violet is the, on the surface, the popular girl with the &quot;right&quot; friends and the &quot;right&quot; boyfriend.  Inside, she is a mess, struggling to survive after losing her sister, her best friend.  She doesn't know how to move on, bogged down in her grief.  The two meet in the worst possible moment, two people who are seemingly totally different.  Yet they are drawn to each other and their story is beautiful.

There is so much depth to this story.  Yes, there are heart wrenchingly sad moments, but there are beautiful ones, too.  There is a ton of unexpected and witty humor, and so much sweetness from Theo that made him even more amazing.  But there is no denying that Theo's story also made me angry, as a parent.  Without giving too much away, it just angered me to see him as he was through much of the book.  If his parents had just opened their eyes and taken the time to BE parents, his story could have been so very different.  And that drove me insane.

My Recommendation:  This is a beautiful read.   The story is not light, but touches on real issues with compassion.  Not every story has a perfectly happy ending, but there is always a lesson to be learned and that is the case with this incredible novel."

I love the quirky characters in the show and was hoping that the book's Temperance Brennan would be the same as the show's.  As it turns out, they have nothing to do with each other.  If you're hoping for the show, don't pick up this book.  If you want a good murder mystery, then this is a pretty good one.  The characters are fairly realistic.  The forensics appear spot on.  The French phrases do get annoying, though.  And WHY do authors always have the main character do really stupid things (like go into bad neighborhoods alone in the middle of the night)?  The ending was appropriate and didn't feel rushed.  I would recommend this book to mystery lovers, but I don't think I'll be reading another one of hers."

923,"The Alchemyst (The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel, #1)",0552562521,Michael Scott,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Double0Kevin,"My girlfriend knew I was a HUGE Harry Potter fan and she saw these books online.  She decided to buy the three books that were out for me.  I began to read The Alchemyst and must admit, at first I was a little turned off and not sure I wanted to finish the book.  It was dwelling a lot on pop culture like the new batman movies and cell phone and lap tops.  Knowing my girlfriend would be disappointed should I not read all the books, I pressed on.  Once the story started unfolding I got more and more into it and realized the pop culture references began to symbolize the link to the real world and became pretty important.  The book became fast paced and really interesting.  Scott does a great job connecting all sorts of real mythology and legends from around the world and brings them in as this connected universe.  I spent a ton of time looking up characters, monsters and locations online just to see if the things they mentioned were real (well...  really myths and legends).  

The Alchemyst is probably the least enjoyable in the series, but thats not bad, it just leads into some even more fast paced and epic stories that are the sequels.  Scott's stories(just like JK Rowling did with the HP series) become more and more complex and well written, they just get better and better.  I can't wait to read the remaining books as well as see the upcoming film adaptations."

The first few pages of this book are absolutely horrendous. The storytelling is stiff and the action scene in the beginning is about as interesting as watching grass grow.
It gets better though. Much better. Rather quickly, the rigid storytelling smooths out and the pages begin to flow. Sprinkled throughout the book are plenty of gods and goddesses (mainly goddesses) that I've never heard of before. And by the end of the book I was very glad that I read it. The only cons are a dull and rather stiff beginning, a gaping plot hole (that will probably be addressed), an irritating main character (*cough* Josh *cough*), and the fact that the book, during the first hundred pages or so, tries too hard to pander to teenagers. Other than that I would really recommend it. If you are looking to start a new series, then try this book out. Believe me; it gets better!"

Jeffrey Eugenides is an extremely talented writer and Middlesex is one of the best pieces of modern fiction I have ever read.  This book, which I highly anticipated, is awful by comparison. The characters are a bunch of whiny,self-centered college students who don't mature by the end of the book. Even the most sympathetic character, Mitchell, grated on me.  So one of the main characters suffers from manic-depression---it really doesn't add much weight to the story other than the reason for the self-absorbed female protagonist to skip her graduation.  I was horribly dissatisfied by this book.  If I could give zero stars on this site, I would."
925,Daughter of Fortune,0061120251,"Isabel Allende, Margaret Sayers Peden",Barnes and Noble,4,Joan-Gareth,"When I first read its synopsis three years ago, I was immediately drawn to what seemed to be a puzzling storyline. How can a young girl from Chile arrive in California, especially in the 1800's during the Gold Rush? The summary read ""because of love,"" but in reality, what can love really accomplish?
The first half or so of the book gives no mention of California until young Eliza Sommers, raised by wealthy owners of an English import/export company in Chile, falls in love with Joaquin Andieta. It is no coincidence that Joaquin and Eliza meet at the time right before the California Gold Rush fever reaches Valparaiso, Chile. Eliza's loneliness and her sense of pride driver her to follow her lover to California and find him, even recruiting the help of a Chinese man whom she knows little about. Armed with only the pearls and golden jewelry her uncle Captain John Sommers has collected for her over the years, she leaves for California and experiences suffering and hardship, both which make her realize that life is too short-lived and it would be impossible for her to return to the proper world of corsets and milky skin. Over time, she even begins forgetting her lover's identity, clinging to their love letters as she tries to overcome the desperation time imbues in her. Driven by legend and a shell of lost romance, Eliza must eventually decide for herself whether or not to forget the past.
The characters themselves are colorful and well-developed. There are chapters in the book devoted to almost every one of them, and Isabel Allende does a wonderful job at developing their history. This significantly builds their development as their attitudes and decisions are driven by their past, and no little detail goes unnoticed. From the stage of the dramatic Italian/English theater to the crowded and buzzing streets of Hong Kong, Allende CREATES a believable world and portrays the characters in a higher dimension. Allende demonstrates a savvy for almost every type of culture, and that knowledge shines through to create a higher level of drama rarely achieved by other authors. As she explains each character, the reader is able to understand them deeply and thus creates a bond between character and reader, enhancing readability.
""Daughter of Fortune"" is an excellent book, and once picked up, it is difficult to put down. Each page is full of imagery, full of choices, and full of a world nobody remembers and few have seen. I highly recommend reading this novel: A tale about a young girl who is willing to lose it all for something she herself lost."
925,Daughter of Fortune,0061120251,"Isabel Allende, Margaret Sayers Peden",Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"The book Daughter of Fortune by Isabel Allende is an extremely engaging and colorful novel. It spans several generations and explores the effects and difficulties of unrequited love. I especially enjoyed the author's wonderful imagery which creates a much more vivid and intimate connection for the reader. Allende's personal ties to the setting in Chile make the description exceptionally powerful. The book incorporates accurate facts and details of the time to make this fiction story seem like reality. Allende uses actual dates and events to verify her plot and places her characters in a historically important background. This setting is not only essential to the plot but to themes as well which touch on the role and view of women in society during this particular time period. 
 The characters are very well characterized and developed, adding to the thrilling story-line. Early on, the reader is able to form a connection with these characters because of their aspirations for the future. The struggles that they overcome and the adversity that they face are very easy for the reader to identify with. The story is focused primarily on the protagonist, Eliza, however, the other supporting characters full of depth and life. Eliza is strong, independent and full of vigor and her undeterred spirit is a driving force in the novel. She is an exceptional example of a woman, escaping the boundaries of her time, by establishing herself as controller of her own fate and destiny. 
This novel would be enjoyed by anyone who enjoys historical fiction with an intriguing plot."

This is the complicated saga of Eliza Sommers, raised as an orphan by a Victorian brother and sister - strict and unfeeling Jeremy and his spinster sister Rose. Secrets abound in Daughter of Fortune. When Eliza falls in love with delivery boy Joaquin Andieta her whole life changes. An obsession to be his ""slave"" claims her and compels her to follow him from Valparasio, Chile to California during the gold rush of 1849."
926,Luckiest Girl Alive,1476789630,Jessica Knoll,Barnes and Noble,3.7,KDH_Reviews,"I admit it. The sole reason I requested this book from Netgalley was the comparison to Gone Girl. I love that book. I love it hardcore. Yes, I know that a lot of times comparisons are unjustified and generally leave you feeling very disappointed. However, I had to take the chance. While I thoroughly enjoyed this book, I wouldn't compare it to Gone Girl (though I suppose I can see the similarities).

Luckiest Girl Alive is a solid book. It captured and held my attention from the very beginning. This book needed my attention. I just had to keep reading and find out what happened. I kept waiting for the BIG twist, the huge reveal... and it just never came. Yes, there is a twist or two. That's true. However, nothing hit me like I expected. I think that says more about my expectations, though, than the book itself. Especially since I stayed fully engaged and interested in the story throughout the book.

Though not comparable to Gone Girl by my standards, this is definitely still a winner. It's a fantastic book that I'm sure many will enjoy.

I clearly am living on a different planet from the editors of Good Housekeeping and all the other reviewers who have favorably compared Jessica Knoll's Luckiest Girl Alive to Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl. I loved Gone Girl, but I found Luckiest Girl Alive so slow and uninteresting (at least for the first 11 chapters, which take up almost two-thirds of the book) that I would have given up on it had I not committed to review it.

Once Knoll turned her attention from the minutiae of Ani's impending society wedding to the hackneyed &quot;chilling and violent incident&quot; which occurred when Ani was a teenager, her story gained some momentum, but Knoll never adequately integrated these experiences into Ani's adult persona so as to explain her present-day actions. On the very first page of the book, for example, Ani fantasizes about stabbing her fianc&eacute; in the stomach while they are shopping for kitchen knives, yet nothing we learn about her past (or, for that matter, her fianc&eacute;'s behavior) accounts for this. Ani remains shallow, self-centered, and unlikeable from start to finish, without any hint of the cleverness which made Flynn's anti-heroine so fascinating.

I received a free copy of Luckiest Girl Alive through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."

The story is fantastic and I may only be a sixteen year old, but when it comes to reading I am extremely picky. I read this book in less then a day. I couldn't put it down. I read it in class, through the halls, on the bus. It followed me everywhere the day I got it from my library."
927,"Crank (Crank, #1)",0689865198,Ellen Hopkins,Barnes and Noble,4.6,JESSZAMBRANO,"There are no words to describe this book.
I think every teenager should read this. It's honest and brutal and really describes the horrors of the addiction without straight up describing it. Through Crank, Ellen Hopkins has created this astoundingly true world that exists right outside my door or yours; almost in a way regardless of age, and there is just no way to truly describe what this book did for me. Even though I've never touched drugs or wanted to, it just seemed to hit. I found myself deeply relating to Kristina, feeling the issues with parents but never saying a word, working to keep that A average, etc. But I also understood the allure of Bree because, no matter how smart a person is, sometimes the desire to just let everything go can start to overpower a person. Even not knowing the feelings and effects in which the drugs instill in Bree, the way Hopkins goes about describing her highs and lows, fall outs and blow ups it makes you feel as if your right in the same state of mind she is in. I also believe that the way in which she actually composed the book, through the short stories/ poems the thickness of the book dissolves much like you do into the pages. The way Hopkins writes about serious subjects like drug abuse and suicide, which make her a frequent target of book banners. One of her most popular books, Crank is based on her own daughter's struggle with drug addiction which leaves more doors open to the thought of ""don't drag myself into something like that"", rather than opening a door to experimenting.
If nothing else, I will continue reading the sequels and every other book by Ellen Hopkins I can get my hands on. Especially since they're not only wondrous, but very quick reads."
928,"The Raven Boys (The Raven Cycle, #1)",0545424925,Maggie Stiefvater,Barnes and Noble,4.4,majibookshelf,"The Raven Boys is a story that is full of fantasy and supernatural occurrences that actually originate from factual, real life beliefs that I actually looked up after finishing the book. However, with this stellar and rich plot, The Raven Boys has a cast of unique, individualistic characters that you can&rsquo;t help but fall a little bit in love with and also be jealous of their friendship and want to be a part of their posse. Four boys, The Raven Boys, the name given to boys who go to Aglionby, the private school for rich kids, are what the story revolves around, along with Blue, the girl that somehow triggers everything around them. 
I honestly think what landed this book in my top books of 2012 list are the characters, their friendship with each other, and how the four boys, even with their differences and their distinct personalities, mesh so well together and would do anything for each other. Then enters the psychic&rsquo;s daughter, Blue. She&rsquo;s destined to either fall in love or kill one of these four boys, and we find which one at the beginning of the novel. Also, prophecies from all psychics have warned her about kissing the love of her life because with that one kiss, death will do them part. Blue quickly becomes a part of their group and I really liked how there are no lies, deceits, and backstabbing happening between them. 
Blue ends up getting close to someone but who is NOT the Raven Boy we were promised in the synopsis and that our hearts, well at least mine, has been dying to get them together. But I must warn you, if you are expecting romance to be the leading theme, or even the secondary theme, then you are mistaken. The first theme is most definitely the boys&rsquo; obsession with finding out the ley line (click on the link to find out more about Ley Lines) and finding the buried one. The second is the friendship between them and how normal life still gets in the way of their quest to unraveling the supernatural that this world does indeed have. Maggie&rsquo;s writing was so enchanting in The Raven Boys; I was holding my breath in so many scenes. I also somehow became as obsessed as the boys were in trying to find the ley lines. Also, Gansey, one of the boys, has totally stolen my heart. He was like the father of all the boys. He busted their butts when they weren&rsquo;t studying, saved them when they got into fights, and vouched for them when they were going to get kicked out of school or were abused at home. 
If you are not a fan of The Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy, then I still urge you to read The Raven Boys. This book is not in the least bit similar to the Shiver series. I honestly wouldn&rsquo;t have guessed for the life of me that the same author wrote both books. I am so glad Maggie has decided to explore her own fascination in ley lines and create such a powerful and memorable novel that had me yearning to get my hands on the second book when the first hasn&rsquo;t even come out yet!"
928,"The Raven Boys (The Raven Cycle, #1)",0545424925,Maggie Stiefvater,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Joie-de-Lire,"Let me just start off by making this clear: the synopsis of this book does not do the actual story justice. Not by a long shot.
Yes, Blue is apparently destined to kill her true love with her kiss, and yes, she meets four Raven Boys.

More than that, though, this book is about an eccentric family of secretive psychics and a non-psychic daughter, a journey to find a magical ley line, the legend of the Welsh king, Glendower, and the fierce friendship between four boys that is complex and heart-breakingly beautiful.

The best part of this book, for me, is definitely the friendship between the four Raven Boys.

You've got Gansey who is born with unimaginable privilege and harbors an obsession for finding the legendary Glendower. I loved the dichotomy of Gansey's character! On the surface he is the cookie-cutter rich boy, but beneath that there is this inexplicably complex nature, from his deep insatiable yearning for Glendower to his love and protectiveness of his friends. I wish I knew the right words to describe Gansey, but all I can tell you is that he is a truly unforgettable character. 


&quot;In the end, he was nobody to Adam, he was nobody to Ronan. Adam spit his words back at him and Ronan squandered however many second chances he gave him. Gansey was just a guy with a lot of stuff and a hole inside him that chewed away more of his heart every year.
They were always walking away from him. But he never seemed able to walk away from them.&quot;

Then you've got Adam, sweet and endearing Adam. He's a tortured hero who has been able to retain this rare kindness and gentleness about him despite the hell he grew up in. Adam comes from nothing and, like Gansey, yearns for something more, but he won't accept anything unless he's earned it himself.

&quot;It means I never get to be my own person. If I let you cover for me, then I'm yours. I'm his now, and then I'll be yours.&quot;

Ronan is the bad-boy of the bunch; angry, intimidating, and downright dangerous. However, there is a concealed softer side of him, a side that may not be described as &quot;kind,&quot; but definitely shows that he cares more about people than he seems to. His past is shrouded in mystery and I really cannot wait for the sequel to find out more about him!

&quot;Gansey had once told Adam that he was afraid most people didn't know how to handle Ronan. What he meant by this was that he was worried that one day someone would fall on Ronan and cut themselves.&quot; 

Last, but certainly not least, is Noah, the most mysterious of the four--but just as endearing. Noah harbors a dark secret which plays an integral part in this novel, both in the the mystery of the book and in the relationships between the Raven Boys.

&quot;Noah was a good bellwether for people. He was so shy and awkward and invisible that he could be easily ignored or made fun of.&quot;

These four boys are as different as could be, but they fit together like jigsaw pieces falling into place, balancing each other and keeping each other in check. Their relationship is complicated, but so compelling to read about, and before I could help it, I'd fallen in love with each of them.

I've read Stiefvater's Shiver trilogy and part of her Scorpio Race, and in The Raven Boys, her writing is still effortlessly gorgeous! Her descriptions are so vivid it's really like I'm in Henrietta, Virginia with its hot days, cold nights, and mountain air.

The only frustrating part of this book, for me, was the romance. Or lack thereof. As a romanceaholic, I crave that bit of romance in books and as I was reading this, I was constantly anticipating the emegence of the romantic element....but it never came! Not really. There was a slight blossoming of feelings, but for a story that emphasized how Blue was going to kill her true love, there really wasn't a whole lot of love present.

AND THAT'S OKAY.

Let me repeat: It's okay that there wasn't much romance. I still loved this book regardless. The story, the mystery, and especially the characters drew me in and kept me a willful prisoner for 408 pages.

Rating: 4.5 stars*

All in all: I. Need. The. Sequel.
I need it now! This book captivated me while I read and even when I finished, I could not get the story or the characters out of my head. So the question now is, how many &quot;reallys&quot; do I have to put before &quot;recommend&quot; to get you to read this?

Let me just say that there is more to this book than what is explained in the synopsis. I am eagerly awaiting what will follow in their quest. I love the depth of the characters and the ""magic"" that comes alive."
929,I Am Legend and Other Stories,031286504X,Richard Matheson,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"After seeing the movie, I wanted to know more, so I picked up the book. I discovered this is actually a short story & was totally different than the movie.Like a lot of books, the story starts out in the present. However, Matheson did not delve into the past's details & when he did, it wasn't quite the chronology I was expecting, which sets this novel apart. Also, I think Matheson portrayed the main character wonderfully! I love that he was so rough & flawed, but this also made the character more real to me. I also enjoyed the sporadic dialogue the main character had with HIMSELF. The dialogue kept the book from being monotonous. Thought-provoking read with enough emotional & scientific-based depth to keep me interested. Not a disappointment."

Most people died while those who survived were biologically altered into nocturnal blood drinking in-humans.  That is everyone except for one remaining purebred  Robert Neville never changed as he apparently was immune to the plague.  He is the last surviving Homo sapiens, but the converted see him as being different as the monster tied to the dead legendary past who must die.  He endures his ordeal through alcohol, but his loneliness is driving him insane as each night he considers giving up until he meets his first non vampire friend since the disease, a dog fearful of him.--------------    This book actually contains a reprint of the 1954 classic novella I AM LEGEND in conjunction with an upcoming movie (note that Vincent Price starred in the 1960s film The Last Man on Earth based on this tale) and ten short stories that are entertaining and well written, but feel like padding to almost double the size of the book.  Readers will understand why some of the great horror writers like Stephen King consider this novella one of the best ever as it crosses science fiction with horror yet holds up well because the bottom line is this is a character study of the human need for companionship as well as a Frankenstein like question as to just who is the monster?-------------    Harriet Klausner"
929,I Am Legend and Other Stories,031286504X,Richard Matheson,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Vivian_Metzger,"There were some things I really loved about I Am Legend. First, it is number one on my list for most scientific books about vampires I have ever read. I was surprised to see the book was very different from the Will Smith movie, but I loved this version too. The thing I liked most about the novel (especially compared to the movie) was the ending. The events of the ending portion of I Am Legend really came out of left field for me. I wasn't expecting what happened, at all. It is very much the most important part of the novel. It leaves us with a message, questioning what we have known and what we believe. I thought it was poignant and powerful, and it certainly left me thinking.

A superb book, filled with such powerful emotions when pondering the existence of humans.

Yes, this book is Legend."
930,Olive Kitteridge,140006208X,Elizabeth Strout,Barnes and Noble,3.7,emmi331,"Elizabeth Strout has crafted a series of short stories revolving around Olive Kitteridge, a retired math teacher in a small town along Maine's coast.  In many of the stories she is barely present, yet is always an influence on the characters.  Like her or loathe her, the reader cannot be indifferent to Olive, or totally unsympathetic.  One of the most intense and memorable stories is ""A Different Road"", about a traumatic experience in which Olive falls briefly in love with a most unlikely character.  Olive's dysfunctional relationships with just about everyone, especially her husband and son, are often ineffably sad, but with occasional hints of redemption.  Each story is completely absorbing."
930,Olive Kitteridge,140006208X,Elizabeth Strout,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Anonymous,"Well writen, well described characters.  Sad stories that leave you feeling sadder than the characters in the end.  I kept looking for what was holding the stories together and hoped for something that made it worthwhile to read.  I suppose it is realistic and somewhat poetic. But it would have been nice to have seen one story end happily."

The supporting characters, Henry Kitteridge, her husband, the complete opposite in character, who is an out going pharmacist, their son, Christopher, a podiatrist, daughter-in-law, Suzanne, all play their roles full of human emotion. These are multi-dimensional, complex, interesting, flawed characters,and how they develop over time. Living in a New England village, they run the gamut of life experiences, good and bad. This is an insightful, profound, moving and thought-provoking look into family conflicts and loss. No life is insignificant! Elizabeth Stout is a master!"

But, if you like the show and are looking for a light-hearted look into twenty-something awkwardness, you will love this book. Lena Dunham does not disappoint with her first book. What reads like a series of personal essays, the book touches on navigating through twenty-something life, sprinkled with advice and of course plenty of humor. In many ways, the book feels in tone like Girls is to watch: self-deprecating humor, neuroses, therapy-laden dependence, bad choices, and awkward situations. Best of all, Dunham sprinkles it with enough humor and affability to let the reader look back at their own life and laugh a bit too. Overall, this book is highly recommended and definitely a must read even if you have to convince your sister to buy it and borrow it when she is done."

After reading the first 20-30 pages, I was so appalled at how trite and empty-headed the writing and the story were that I couldn't go on.

My main complaint is the obscenely ridiculous reviews that came nowhere near delivering the truth and suckered me into wasting my time and ten bucks on an effort that couldn't survive an adolescent book club even if it came with pictures."

932,Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap... and Others Don't,0066620996,James C. Collins,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Shyamashree-Rudra,"Good to Great is Jim Collins's follow-up to Built to Last, the 1994 management classic, which he co-wrote with Jerry Porras. Infact, Collins calls Good To Great a ""prequel"" to his hugely successful Built To Last. I call it one of the most important Business Leadership books I have read. While Built To Last was a great book, however, it left out critical information, because those companies were already great. What about those of us struggling to move our companies from Good To Great as opposed to those trying to hold on to greatness? The missing piece is clearly identified in Collins' Good To Great. Collins spent five years of research assisted by 20 business school students, who analyzed 1,435 public companies for this book. Their findings - just 11 companies from were able to sustainable their good to great efforts. 
Having identified the companies that made the leap from Good To Great, Collins and his team set out to examine the transition point. What characteristics did the Good To Great companies have that their industry counterparts did not? What didn't the Good To Great companies have? Collins maps out three stages, each with two key concepts. These six concepts are the heart of Good To Great and he devotes a chapter to explaining each of them.
.Level 5 Leadership
.First Who... Then What
.Confront the Brutal Facts
.The Hedgehog Concept
.A Culture of Discipline
.Technology Accelerators
Many experts have problems with the way Collins and his team performed their ""research."" Some argue that Collins's measure for greatness is flawed or that his work fails to be classified as true research because it does not follow any scientific method. Or that the key measure used by Collins (""Ratio of Cumulative Stock Returns to General Market"") looks at the company only through the eyes of one stakeholder - the owners. These arguments may be a bit unfair because some of the variables in business do not lend themselves well to true research; greatness is a subjective quality; and the amount of immeasurable historical variables for this particular project is so immense. If research of this nature was an easy task, we should have written tried and tested formulas for perfect businesses, leaders, schools, cities, et al during our 3,000 plus years of civilization. 
Unlike many business books that are based on hype and after-market consulting services, Good to Great is mainly based on good old fashion business principles. Sure, Collins renames some of them with gimmicky names like Hedgehog Concept and The Flywheel. But for the most part, Collins's book has some sound principles in it that the reader shouldn't necessarily take as a game plan, but rather a starting point for conversation, reflection and inspiration both for themselves and their team. 
How does his research reflect in the current economic slowdown? If I were to apply Collins' theory in today's recessionary environment, I would show one priority above all others: to acquire as many of the best people as possible. I'd put off everything else to fill my bus. Because things are going to come back. The flywheel is going to start to turn. And the single biggest constraint on the success of any organization will be the ability to get and to hang on to enough of the right people.
To sum up, Good to Great can be a very useful tool when its principles are adapted to the user's unique situation and variables."
932,Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap... and Others Don't,0066620996,James C. Collins,Barnes and Noble,4.2,MAXIMUS15,"After reading this book I was not very impressed. Jim Collins started with a template and tried to find companies that would fit into his template. His leadership idea is nothing new and he could have taken all the leaders in the world and found stories that fit into his mold. His revelations are obnoxious and he spends about half the book talking about the good to great concept instead of using deep analysis to uncover some hidden truths.

One of the greatest flaws of this book is how he took a good look at certain companies through interviews but he failed to study any of the accounting changes that effected some of the businesses he discusses. One of the most notable is Walgreen's and circuit city who were able to structure their leases in such a way that they did not have to disclose them on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities. Walgreens and Circuit City grew because their bankers didn't get the full picture of how much debt the company was able to take on under the table and not disclose. Now that these companies are forced to disclose that information they appear less solvent and their stock price has adjusted to reality. Additionally Circuit City tanked when the new accounting practices and bad economy showed how insolvent they really were.

Other things Jim Collins failed to mention involved the establishment of right to work states that ended union control on companies and allowed NUCOR to establish one of the most efficient manufactures in the world.

Most of the companies Jim talks about have fallen apart in heaps and are bad to average. He should have written a book about how little research he had to do to write a book that would get praise from the entire academic sector but be a complete bad to worse book at best.

Don't buy the book! Save your money and take some accounting classes and you can then uncover what takes a company from good to great!"
932,Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap... and Others Don't,0066620996,James C. Collins,Barnes and Noble,4.2,KROG,"I thought this book was well written and a pleasure to read. While reading I could not help but wonder where are these companies now? Many are no longer in business and several have been able to continue with their success. Circuit City, Fannie Mae, and Gillette are three that are no longer &ldquo;great&rdquo;.  Two that seem to still be thriving are Walgreens and Wells Fargo.  Although three out of the eleven companies studied are no longer in business I do not think this discredits Collins&rsquo; work. His overall message that, &ldquo;Greatness is not a function of circumstance. Greatness, it turns out, is largely a matter of conscious choice&rdquo; can still be applied to anyone who wants to enhance their company. 

The book is instructive and accessible and I think this is a great book to add to the curriculum for all business students.  By using metaphors Collins makes his ideas easy to understand and follow which will become critical as future business executives try to emulate.  He gives concrete examples of company&rsquo;s successes and failures and then applies tangible models that are easy to imitate.  I also believe that this book goes beyond just a business book. This book can be used for several different professions and for the overall betterment of one&rsquo;s life.  We all look to become an effective leader, find something that we are truly good at, and surround ourselves with people who help achieve our goals. Sometime in life it better to think like Collins and not always try to come up with the answers, but better to ask the right questions."
933,"Fire (Graceling Realm, #2)",0803734611,Kristin Cashore,Barnes and Noble,4.4,alissa47,"I loved Graceling, so I was more than eager to jump into Fire-and believe me, it did not disppoint. It was every bit as good as Graceling. Within the first five minutes of reading I had an oh #@%& moment,and was hooked until the end. I love the way Kristin Cashore developes her characters-and to think, this is only her second book. I am already in great anticipation for the realse of Bitterblue. If you are a fan of Graceling, this book will not disppoint and no review will be able to do it justice."
933,"Fire (Graceling Realm, #2)",0803734611,Kristin Cashore,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Angieville,"GRACELING was one of my very favorite reads of 2008 and the year's best YA I would venture to say. And before you get all up in arms, let me assure you I enjoyed THE HUNGER GAMES as much as the next person. But GRACELING was just the one, you know? And I have this feeling that Kristin Cashore is something special. I was positively thrumming with anticipation when I heard she had a second book to follow. FIRE is, in point of fact, a prequel to GRACELING and takes place 30 years or so prior to Katsa and Poe's story. It is also set in an entirely different land, though definitely in the same world, and (as I am sure you have already heard) a certain terrifyingly familiar character from GRACELING makes an appearance in FIRE. Otherwise, it is its own story and it stands completely on its own feet.

Fire is a monster. A human monster. And the last of her kind. In her homeland, the Dells, there are all manner of monsters from lizards and mosquitoes to leopards and raptors. But they all have one thing in common--their incomparable beauty. These creatures come in a gorgeous riot of color and texture and are so beautiful they literally impede rational thought in the humans they come into contact with. With the ability to control the minds of those around them, they inspire an uncomfortable (at times deadly) mixture of fear, hatred, and absolute longing in the people of the Dells. And no one is more hated or sought after than Fire. Her father was King Nax's most trusted advisor and closest friend. He was also the one responsible for the king's untimely death and for the current chaotic state of the realm. When Fire's service is requested on behalf of the young King Nash and his brother and war commander Brigan, Fire is thrust out of her quiet life and into a mounting war. Forced to reconcile her questionable abilites with her own demanding conscience, she is immediately caught between right and wrong, a dark past and uncertain present, and a pair of brothers determined to win at all costs.

This book made short work of me. There was just so much hope inside me wrapped around how good it would be and when it turned out to be approximately ten times better than all that wrapped up hope....well....I was a goner. I looked forward all day long to the moment I could crawl back in bed and read more about the Dells and Fire and Brigan and Archer. And the list goes on. These characters are breathtakingly real and the way the gorgeous, understated writing tugs and pulls and builds a complex and lovely world around them makes the whole package irresistable. Best of all, Fire herself struck a chord deep within me and I held my breath as I watched her move through her world, worried she wouldn't meet with enough care, hoping someone in the messy throng of plotting, planning, warring kings and soldiers would recognize her for what she was. Like Katsa before her, she is so very strong, an outcast her entire life, and yet she never turns her back on those who need her. Even when they have no idea how desperately they do. Even when she herself is afraid. FIRE is, wait for it, even better than its predecessor. It's subtle and thoughtful and throbbing with genuine emotion--three qualities I often find lacking in my reading. It is, without a doubt, the most difficult of combinations to achieve, but when the right note is struck....magic."
933,"Fire (Graceling Realm, #2)",0803734611,Kristin Cashore,Barnes and Noble,4.4,acornucopiaoflove,"Ever since I read that Kristin Cashore was writing two companion novels to Graceling, I couldn't wait to read them. Graceling was a great novel (that I couldn't put down), so I set my hopes very high for Fire.

Characters:
This story focuses on the character, Fire, a half-human, half-monster. She's able to control the minds of people around her, but she's very cautious about using this power unless it's absolutely necessary. Similar to Katsa, Fire is an extremely strong female character, but she's conflicted about her gifts. She's extremely beautiful, due to her half-monster lineage. This may sound like a blessing, but she is forced to hide her dazzling hair under a scarf, because it attracts people to her. To Fire, her monster powers are more of a curse than a gift. It's also because of these powers that she's constantly reminded of her father. He was fiercely protective of her, but cruel to everyone else he encountered.

Plot:
I really enjoyed Fire's story. It seemed like the book delved a lot deeper into who she was. Particularly, what it meant to be part-monster, but feel as humans do. I enjoyed reading Fire's memories of her father, Cansrel. He was a full monster, and had no qualms with manipulating the minds of people around him to do his bidding. Fire's memories seemed to emphasize that, while she hadn't always made the best choices, she had a conscience. She never manipulated the minds of people when it wasn't completely necessary. The romance was very subtle, and built up very nicely over the course of the story. It didn't feel rushed, or forced, and really affirmed the humanity in Fire.

We also got to see the origins of a character from Graceling. I won't give away the name, even though he's introduced in the very early pages of the book. I'll just say this, I hated the character in this book too!

Final Say:
Is it wrong that I want a sequel about Fire? I absolutely loved this book, and can't wait for Bitterblue, Cashore's next book."
934,Waiting for Godot,0000000000,Samuel Beckett,Barnes and Noble,4,ShotgunAndy,"As a matter of fact, I do dare to state such a claim.  Samuel Beckett is such an amazing writer, and in WfG, he has created some of the most memorable characters and dialouge in any medium.  A must read for everyone."
934,Waiting for Godot,0000000000,Samuel Beckett,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"Waiting for Godot is humorous and ironic. It's characters' senility gives the book a similar feel to that of old Charlie Chaplain movies. The characters repetitive conversations add to that feel but also allow the reader to, if he/she wants to, pull out several meanings from the book. The whole book parallels the human experience of waiting for our own Godot, whether it be God or Wealth or family, whatever gives our lives meaning. With each meaning the detail of the book presents different symbols, unique to whatever it is the reader is comparing it to."
934,Waiting for Godot,0000000000,Samuel Beckett,Barnes and Noble,4,Devil_llama on LibraryThing,"A play that can be called true genius. Word play is delightful, and the characters are quirky and original. It does lose a bit in the reading as the action must be visualized rather than seen, but reading it makes it easier to catch all the double entendres and language tricks that sort of pass over you while watching the play staged. This is a play for the ages; the central theme does not date, and the metaphor is subtle enough to be enjoyed, but not so subtle that it is overlooked altogether. A must for any theatre aficianado."
935,White Fang,0439236193,Jack London,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Wiicho-,"In the amassing story White Fang By Jack London the author teaches you to keep moving on.  This is because through out the story white fang (the main character) faces many problems such as losing his mother, getting into illegal dog fights, and many more, but despite that he kept moving on.

    The story begins with two men mushing (dog sledding) up in the mountains of Alaska.  Soon their dogs start to disappear one by one, this is because of a she-wolf and her pack of wolfs killing them.  One night Henry (one of the men) spots the wolfs trying to eat one their dogs.  Immediately got his gun out, sadly it only had 3 bullets.  As quick as possible Henry charged towards the wolf's.  Henry fired his gun but sadly missed.  Before Henry could reload his gun one of the wolfs pounced on him and killed him leaving Bill (the other man) all alone.  Luckily Bill scared off the wolfs by using fire.  Afterwards the wolfs regrouped.  The she-wolf then found a mate and had puppies, unfortunately only one of the pups survived.  The she-wolf and white fang(the pup) then returned to a native American village where the she-wolf's master lived.  Soon the master sold the she-wolf to another man leaving White fang all alone with Gray beaver(The master).

    Time went on and white fang grew more vicious each day.  Grey beaver then decided to move to another city.  Once there Gary beaver encountered beauty smith(a monster of a man) and was forced to give white fang to him.  Beauty Smith then started to make white fang more vicious.  Afterward he put white fang in illegal dog fights.  White fang kept wining and wining, until one day that he met his match a bulldog.  White fang fought but got injured and almost died luckily a young man named Scott save his life.  Scott then tamed white fang and brought him to California whit him where he lived a happy life.

     This book has been one of the best ones I've read.  This is because this book has action, drama, and suspense all packed into one book. I also recommend The Call of the wild By Jack London.  I recommend this book to anyone who likes action and suspense."
935,White Fang,0439236193,Jack London,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"You should read White Fang cause its a very interesting book  and when ur reading it, it teaches kids a lesson and puts the world in a diffrent point of view"

To really bring his entire ability to work in the Calla. The pictures that imagination pulls and forges with King's words are intense and powerful.

936,"Wolves of the Calla (The Dark Tower, #5)",141651693X,"Stephen King, Bernie Wrightson",Barnes and Noble,4.3,sturlington on LibraryThing,"The fifth installment in the Dark Tower series is full of cross-references to other King works that I love, further unifying the Stephen King universe, which even in this one novel has an infinite number of connected worlds. It begins by bringing in a familiar character from our world: Father Callahan of `Salem¿s Lot, who after that fateful encounter with vampires began to walk the hidden roads of America, finally winding up in a rice-growing village in Roland¿s world. There Roland and crew meet him and make him a part of their ka-tet. Father Callahan also has another piece of the Wizard¿s Glass: the black eye of the Crimson King himself, which our heroes can use to get back to New York to do important things.There¿s a lot going on in this long novel. We learn more of the rose first glimpsed by Jake in The Wastelands (Volume III) and find out what kind of danger it is in. There is news of the Beams and the Breakers, and even the Low Men make an appearance. There is the small matter of Susannah¿s demon pregnancy. And there is a spaghetti Western-style plot in which Roland and the others have to save a town from marauding wolves who steal one-half of all the town¿s twins (and the kids are mostly twins), only to return them retarded and doomed ¿ ¿roont,¿ as the townsfolk of the Calla say.The cross-references abound, and King even manages to gleefully introduce elements from Marvel comics, Star Wars and the Harry Potter series. But the climactic reference in thrillingly audacious, even for King. I won¿t give it away; suffice it to say, you won¿t be able to wait to start reading Part 6."
938,"The Edge of Never (The Edge of Never, #1)",1480095532,J.A. Redmerski,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Ari_K,"This is, hands down, one of the best books I've read this year! Not just because of how original, emotional and brilliant the story is, and not because I'm a huge sucker for road-trip/traveling stories, but it's written in exactly the way I like it and I am just blown away by it.
Actually, I'm writing this on zero sleep because I got the &quot;one more chapter&quot; disease reading it - I really just wanted to read the first chapter while getting ready to go to bed to see if I'd like it...and see how that turned out!

Andrew is the perfect hero! I have never said this before, and probably never will again, but yeah, he really was perfect. He is a genuinely nice guy with just the right amount of cockiness, but there are just so many more layers than that to his character. You seriously can't help but fall in love with him and everything about him!

I loved Cam, too. She is strong but fragile at the same time, and honestly, I admired her bravery to just get away from everything and leave. I love it that she breaks all her rules and doesn't fight herself breaking them.

And I loved their banter and camaraderie, the way they were teasing each other (the pool playing scene? brilliant.) the chemistry between Cam and Andrew was just...perfect. Somehow their relationship progressed in very realistic way and I really really liked that.

So many feelings about this.
You don't see the twist coming at all, at least not one like that. I mean, I guessed there was something going on, but it kind of all comes crashing down when you least expect it with a BAM! and it's a lot to take in.
The last two chapters made me gasp and cry in turns.

I mean, just wow. The pacing of this is perfect, the switching of POV was unexpected but welcomed - I was concerned about this in the beginning, but really, the author handles it perfectly, she gives these two characters two completely different voices! Oh and yeah, some of the best sex scenes I've read in a while.
I haven't read anything by J.A. Redmerski before but I will definitely try to, now that I've seen what she can do!"

938,"The Edge of Never (The Edge of Never, #1)",1480095532,J.A. Redmerski,Barnes and Noble,4.6,DaisyLovesBooks,"I laughed, I cried, I perfected my O face. And I was completely jealous that Andrew Parrish wasn't mine. 

First off, let me begin with how gorgeous that cover is. The girl's a beauty and it immediately draws you in and makes you envious. However, that envy was short-lived as I journeyed through The Edge of Never. At first, I felt the beginning read a little slow. I didn't realize until later that the problem wasn't pace, it was her life. Cam was absolutely miserable, and just following along with her made me realize how unhappy she was, just how mundane everything around her was as she dealt with the aftermath of the past two years. Her first boyfriend, who she lost her virginity to, died in a car accident, her next boyfriend cheated on her, her alcoholic brother was in jail 'cause he killed someone driving drunk one night, and her father cheated on her mother and they got divorced, so now she was tramping around dating everything in sight. It wasn't until she got fed up with everything and boarded the bus to nowhere and met Andrew Parrish, that Cam seemed to come to life and her story began to excite me. And then I appreciated the way the beginning read, 'cause if it hadn't, I never would've realized what an impact Andrew had on Cam's spirit.

Andrew Parrish: Sexy. Protective and Possessive (in a Good Way). Sexually Confidant. Secretly Passionate. And there were soooooooooo many times I wanted to give Cam the boot and take her place. The best part of all was that Cam didn't even know why he was trying to keep her attention in the beginning, and the more time they spent together, the more he fell for her. They both had their reasons to be stubborn about taking their newfound relationship further, and the angst was literally ripping my heart to shreds. Both Cam and Andrew had fallen on hard times, and both deserved something positive to happen in their lives, so you can't help but root for them as one problem after another tests their strength. By the end, I think I shed enough tears to fill Lake Pontchartrain.

J.A. Redmerski has won my heart all over again. The Edge of Never is by far the best of her work. Okay...I may be a little bias 'cause I love books heavy on angst, where the couple doesn't just throw themselves into bed, but eventually gets there and gives me some of the hottest scenes that perfect my O face and activates the launch sequence for book boyfriend jealousy. Check it out, you're gonna love it. And peeps, this novel is for the 17+ crowd for language and very hot, yummy, descriptive sexual situations."
939,Reconstructing Amelia,006222543X,Kimberly McCreight,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,Definitely a MUST to read! Leaves you on the edge of your seat and keeps you hooked all the way through. An ending you never saw coming and so many twists &amp; turns. Outstanding!
939,Reconstructing Amelia,006222543X,Kimberly McCreight,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"Every now and then you read a book that surprises you for just how unique it is. A story that sets itself apart from any other. This book was that for me. Some reviewers were disappointed with the end. I wasn't. I honestly don't think the end matters. This book is about relationships, about lost opportunities and forgiveness. It is about finding out who we are by learning about who the people we loved really were and still finding a way to live with our mistakes and the 'what if's'. A fantastic story, terrific writing, and a book and characters that keep you thinking. You cannot ask for more."
939,Reconstructing Amelia,006222543X,Kimberly McCreight,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"The writing was absolutely horrid.  I couldn't stomach the way the writer was trying SO HARD to sound like she knows how teens/young adults talk -- she missed the mark by A LOT.   This is the last sentence I read and gave up (this is supposed to be a 24 year old IT guy who works at one of the top law firms in New York&hellip;but is also a stoner...):  &quot;...Because you don't want to like [sic] get into the deets of your kid's Facebook page. I mean, I'm twenty-four, and I'm a pretty scrubbed-up guy and whatevs, but my 'rents would stroke out if they saw my whole page. You've gotta filter it for ma and pa. I mean, who wants to see their kid doing body shots, like, ever?&quot;
 There are grammatical and spelling errors riddled throughout the book, which drove me bananas. Sentence structure was that of somebody who has never written before. The plot could have been interesting, but the writing was just too much to get past.  Also, this is definitely not a book that should be marketed towards adults.  Her &quot;trying-to-be-hip-and-with-it&quot; lingo will turn off the younger crowd as well...Definitely not recommended."

940,One Plus One,0525426582,Jojo Moyes,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"One plus One was an okay read.  Typical love story.. Girl meets boy, girl doesn't like boy, girl falls in love with boy, boy leaves girl, boy comes back...ta-da...Happy Ending. Still, even though I knew the happy ending was coming, the over all story held my interest. I finished it, but nothing that shook me up."

The characters were very true to life, a mother struggling to do the right thing for her children, the children a little off center and a goofy dog.  And not to forget the male character and his connection to the family.  The book was very different from Me Before You.  It was a delightful and funny book. Ms Moyes other book, The Girl I Left Behind was also very good and very different from this book.  She is an excellent writer and brings so much to her books.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book and her other books."
941,The Hours,0312305060,Michael Cunningham,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"Michael Cunningham's The Hours is a timeless piece of literary achievement that is deserving of its Pulitzer Prize. He remarkably and cleverly weaves the stories of three different women of three different time periods into one flowing story. There is Virginia Woolf in 1923, and her story is followed as she writes her greatest literary achievement, Mrs. Dalloway. Then, there is Laura Brown, a wife and mother from 1949, who struggles with the confinement of her life and seeks to escape it through reading Mrs. Dalloway. Then finally, there is Clarissa Vaughn, a curious reincarnation of Clarissa Dalloway, who is alive at the end of the twentieth century, and whose story follows the planning of a party for a friend. Each finds herself in an undesired position -one of dissatisfaction. These three stories are soon woven together, depicting each individual's triumphs and sorrows and eventually, the connection all three share, despite the passage of time. 
The book really gave me something to chew on. For one, Cunningham's depiction of the theme of confinement was certainly interesting. Though each woman is under a very different situation, each feels that they are somehow constrained. What is more interesting is how each woman handles her situation. Another thing that amazed me was Cunningham's ability to highlight the most everyday things, and give them the most expressive descriptions to make them come alive. He is able to portray that life does not just go on, but every waking moment of life is something special. Interestingly enough, he also contrasts that theme with the idea that life is just a fleeting picture. 
I personally found the book enjoyable. The imagery Michael creates is just stunning, and really brings out the essence of everyday life. At the same time, he is able to manipulate the imagery, syntax, and diction to create a different picture depending on the character. The plot is certainly unique and is very craftily put together. I enjoyed my time reading the book for its literary brilliance. At the same time, I feel that the book was a little over-done at times. While the descriptions certainly add to the life of the book, they do become slightly overwhelming or confusing at times. Also, there are a lot of names to keep track of, making certain parts feel like they're too much to swallow at once. I would recommend this book to those who are looking for a good read and a good piece of literature. After I finished reading, not only was I left wowed, but I was also left with a lot to think about. However, I wouldn't recommend this to someone looking for a climactic plot, or a thriller as this is one of those pieces that is simply done to show the power of the pen. Also, it is better suited toward juniors in high school and beyond, as it features some material that requires some maturity to appreciate. 
And so, through his great style of writing, Cunningham is able to entice the reader into getting lost in The Hours, much as Laura Brown fell into Mrs. Dalloway."
941,The Hours,0312305060,Michael Cunningham,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"If you've seen the movie and not yet read the book, I would highly recommend Mr. Cunningham's work. The successful transfer of his novel to motion picture says a great deal about David Hare, the man who wrote the screenplay,and did a beautiful job, I must say. The way the movie flows from one era to another is done so masterfully by all who worked to create the motion picture version of this work. Both the novel and screenplay are a 'NOT TO BE MISSED, MUST READ AND SEE'. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND BOTH!"
941,The Hours,0312305060,Michael Cunningham,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"THE HOURS is a book both beautiful and agonizing, portraying human emotion clearly, like a bell rung through a forest: you hear it, you want to run to it, but it is too far away. Lovely."
942,"Wallbanger (Cocktail, #1)",1623420024,Alice Clayton,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"There&rsquo;s almost nothing in this world that I love more than laughing out loud while reading a book. I did that over and over while reading Wallbanger. Alice knows just how to intermingle hilarious situations with crazy monkey sex without making me feel uncomfortable for laughing at a sexy book.

Wallbanger is a Smut Book Club MUST MUST read for fans of a well-written story, well-crafted characters who make you warm in your belly and laugh out loud."
942,"Wallbanger (Cocktail, #1)",1623420024,Alice Clayton,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"So funny and engaging!
I almost did not buy this book because of its title. But am I glad I did! I don't usually laugh reading books, but this one cracked me up from beginning to end. The dialogs are so fresh and funny that you feel as if you are part of them, like the way you would talk to your girlfriends or the friend next door. The jokes don't get old or tiring. And the continuous banter between the characters is critical to the storyline and the development of this beautiful love story that starts in the most unconventional way: the woman meeting the man that wakes her up every night with his steamy sexual encounters (he is the 'wallbanger'). This book does not disappoint!"
942,"Wallbanger (Cocktail, #1)",1623420024,Alice Clayton,Barnes and Noble,4.5,calwen,"Wallbanger is quite funny and enjoyable story. Main theme of the story is heroine's unsuccessful sex life and her frustration with the fact that she cannot change it while her neighbour is enjoying his harem girls reguraly and loudly... Besides the sexual frustration of main heroine, the level of angst is quite low, so it was light read for me. From time to time I just need to switch off and not think during the book, and Wallbanger gave me exactly that. Caroline had great sense of humour and it kept me intrigued through out the whole story. 

If you are in mood for some funny and easy reading, go for this one."

943,Holidays on Ice,0316191299,David Sedaris,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,Holidays on ice is absolutely one of the funniest books I've ever had the sheer pleasure of reading. The 'Macy's Elf' essay is side-splittingly funny.
943,Holidays on Ice,0316191299,David Sedaris,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,Holidays on Ice - It's hard to write a review through the tears of laughter. A very funny book. Remember the school Christmas plays? Suppose a theater critic was there and wrote a review. It happens in Holidays on Ice. Santaland Diaries is a classic that everyone who ever waited in line to sit on Santa's lap will appreciate. And there's the Christmas letter from hell. Don't wait until December to read this book.

944,Desperation,0451188462,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"Everything seems normal for the various people travelling through Nevada on the U.S. 50, that is, until a cop with strange eyes pulls each of them over for no apparent reason. Mysteriously, each of the novelÃ¢â¿¬â¿¢s characters are charged and arrested for crimes that they are almost certain they did not commit. One individual finds drugs in the back of his car and has no clue where they came from  another is ushered into the back of the police car after all four of his tires were punctured by an inconveniently placed piece of police equipment. All of these individuals are taken to a small town in Desperation, Nevada, an area with a name that sets the mood for the novel. The plot takes an ugly twist almost immediately when the now erratic and seemingly insane cop kills off one individual and throws the rest into holding cells. From there, the main characters of the novel, which are surprisingly well developed, despite the large amount of them, try to break out of the copÃ¢â¿¬â¿¢s prison (complete with a guard wolf), and escape from the twisted and plagued town which prays upon the fears and weaknesses of each individual, undermining their every move in an attempt to supply hosts for a greater, primal entity. While it may seem that KingÃ¢â¿¬â¿¢s novel is a bit out there and much too unbelievable to contain anything beside a fun read, this is not so. In fact, one of DesperationÃ¢â¿¬â¿¢s most appealing factors is its in-depth analysis of the human psyche, which, as a real world application, presents a satisfying contrast to the novelÃ¢â¿¬â¿¢s fantastical (Although I stress that it is darker and more twisted than the typical fantasy tales) plot. Combine such an intriguing, thought provoking story with Stephen KingÃ¢â¿¬â¿¢s writing, which describes every horrible moment of the novel in such a way that the reader can picture the scene perfectly. Desperation is the only book that I have ever read which was able, through such descriptive writing and a captivating, yet revolting (in a good way), tale, to make me paranoid for a while after putting it down at night. Thus, I give Desperation a full five star rating and label it as one of my favorite books."
944,Desperation,0451188462,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.3,xMissMelaniex,"I started reading Stephen King as a teenager. Back then he could throw anything at me and I ate it up. As an adult, he actually goes places I'm not sure I like him going and I'm totally horrified! He's still a masterful writer and if you love having the tarnation scared out of you, no one will do it better."
944,Desperation,0451188462,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"I think this book is classic Stephen King, and it represents the best of Stephen King.  I loved this book for the same reasons I love The Green Mile and The Stand.  The novel contains a well proportioned mix of fear, humanity, and spirituality.  What made Desperation different from The Stand and The Green Mile was that the scare factor was much larger in this novel.  There was a lot more violence, suspense, and thrill to it.  However, the undertones of the story, i.e. the spirituality of it, was what really made it impossible for me to put down.  I read it in less than a week, which is unprecedented for a slow reader like me.      Don't listen to the nay-sayers.  This book is VERY worth reading and I suggest you give it a try if you are feeling on the fence about it."

Scales (1 to 10)

Characters - 6
The characters in this book aren't as likeable as those in The Maze Runner. The just don't have the same pizazz as Thomas and his friends in the maze.

Writing - 7
Dashner definity improved his writing tecniques since The Maze Runner trilogy. However, sometimes I felt as though the author was only writing certain selections for the sole purpose of appealing to young people through unecassary violence and romance.

Violence - 9
The book is packed full of action seens. Although it's not as violent as The Maze Runner or even The Hunger Games. The gore is kept to a minimum although parents and teahers should be wary.

Sexuality/Sensuality - 4
The main character, Mark, has a girlfriend. The do hug and kiss on some occasions. Towards the begining of the book, his girlfriend makes a joke about the two of them having sex and later in the book, they spend the night togeather but the book goes into no further details.

Drugs/Alchol - 2
There are a few minor alchol references in the book, but nothing extreme.

Swearing - 4 
Mild inapropriate language is used. Words such as ""damn,"" ""hell,"" and ""bastard"".

Sexism/Prejuicism/Racism - 3
There are practically no strong female characters in the book.

Recomended minimum age of reader: 12"

(Team Minho FTW) However, this wasn't what I was expecting. There's a prologue and epilogue that focus on the characters of the Glade but other than that, this is a completely different story with new characters. It's still interesting and action packed with characters as intense as the ones we've come to know but for fans looking for more information on Thomas, Teresa, or Brenda, they might be disappointed. I was hoping for more background on the Gladers themselves. For those readers who are just beginning the series, I would say to this is a good place to start."

Susan Ee puts you right into the action on page one and never stops. Action packed and infused with snarky humor that had me giggling between moments of holding my breath, this book never lets go. 

Post apocalyptic, dystopian, and fantasy lovers will LOVE this book. Six weeks after angels of the apocalypse have destroyed the modern world, life as we know it is over and chaos ensues. The survival of her family falls on Penryn's shoulders and once her sister is taken by the angels, Penryn must rely on a wingless and broken angel, fighting his own battles, to help her get her back.

Angelfall runs the emotional gamut here and Susan Ee's ability to make you feel it all is amazing! Action packed, a touch of horror, a hint of romance, and always with a bit of humor. Susan Ee has written an amazing book and I look forward to seeing where the story goes from here. 

Congratulations Susan Ee on a wonderful debut book and for being a finalist in the 2011 Cybils Award for the Year's Best Fantasy & Science Fiction."

Penryn is an engaging heroine as she travels through a post-apocalyptic world to rescue her paraplegic sister from angels. She's a fighter and survivor. Love that! The chemistry between Penryn and Raffe, the maimed angel, pulls you in at emotional level. You root for each of them even as their interests seem to be conflicting. 

I hope the next book releases soon! It's so exciting to see an indie author become successful.  I can only see this author becoming a HUGE success."
947,"Angelfall (Penryn & the End of Days, #1)",144477851X,Susan Ee,Barnes and Noble,4.7,The-Happy-Booker,"Angelfall deposits the reader right in the middle of this formidable post apocalyptic world where there are dangers lurking everywhere, both human and other. Angels have descended and ravaged the earth and those who are left resort to any means necessary to survive. Penryn is trying to take care of her small family since her father skipped out on them. She has to worry about a mother who is often lost in schizophrenic delusions as well as look out for her crippled and wheelchair bound little sister. Penryn is the one responsible for finding food and shelter as they try to constantly stay one step ahead of the dangerous street gangs and the bloodthirsty angels that can swoop down from above without warning. These angels have been in a really bad mood since their leader, Gabriel, was gunned down and they have been wreaking havoc, destroying so much of the world that the landscape has become unrecognizable and the few survivors struggle to endure day to day. It all seems rather hopeless and Penryn's only motivation to continue on is the little sister who couldn't survive without her. When Penryn impulsively saves an angel from being torn apart by his own kind, the other angels retaliate by flying off with her helpless little sister. Now Penryn will risk anything to get her back, including joining forces with one of the enemy.  

Awed..speechless.blown away.these are the words I would use to describe how much I enjoyed Angelfall. The writing was impeccable, I was lost in the story from the first page and it only got better as it continued. The author created a desolate world using vivid imagery and fascinating characters. The angels were crazy scary. At one point Penryn sees a sign that says ""Who will protect us from the guardians"" and I think that pretty much sums it up. They view humans as talking monkeys and are ruthless in taking what they want. These are not the pretty creatures we see on Christmas cards. I was surprised that, although these were the angels and archangels of the apocalypse, Angelfall didn't stray too deeply into religion. It was interesting they way the author weaved bits and pieces of the angels background into the story, leaving them somewhat mysterious but giving enough of an explanation to satisfy, for now. I definitely want to understand more about them in the sequel. 

The growing relationship, not necessarily romance, between Raffe and Penryn was one of the highlights of the story for me. There was the slow development of mutual respect for one another which then progressed into trust and loyalty as they helped each other through some pretty scary situations. There was also a physical attraction that was always there but didn't overshadow the more ""real"" things they started to feel for one another. I don't see that slow, realistic progression often in fiction but I liked it. And Raffe..wow..I can't wait to read more of HIM!!! His courage, strength, and loyalty was certainly swoon worthy for me. 
Ultimately, this is one of the best, if not the best, book I have read in 2011.  I can't recommend it enough. I can't believe this was only $2.99!!! Angelfall is as a fast paced exciting page turner that will keep you up late into the night reading. I devoured this in just one day, staying up until 4 in the morning to finish it! This dark and gritty and beautifully written novel is a must read for fans of fantasy, dystopian, post-apocalyptic, angels, or anyone who just enjoys an exciting and ext"

948,Empire Falls,0375726403,Richard Russo,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"When my mom recommended this book, I was a little skeptical- her taste and mine don't necessarily mesh. From around the third page, I could see why she enjoyed this book. Great subtle humor from the main character's perspective! You can envision living in Empire Falls, because it is not so different from many small towns in America. As a mom, I was interested in the relationship between Tick and her mother, as well as her and her father's relationship. Overall, a wonderful read for just about anyone. Even my sister wants to read it now after how I said what a good book it is, and she doesn't even like to read! This would be a great book for book club discussion as well."
948,Empire Falls,0375726403,Richard Russo,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"When I first started reading it, I wondered, 'what is this book going to be ABOUT?' By the time I was halfway through, I was so involved with the character's lives that the plot evolved without my realizing it. Engaging, insightful, heartbreaking, a wonderful read, fully accessible to all readers.  Empire Falls, a small town economically ruled for many years by the Whiting family in Maine, begins to lose over the years the 'ROYAL' family and their influence. The true power lies not with this wealthy family, but with the force of HUMAN WILL POWER 'whether a WHITING or a NON-WHITING'.

If you buy this book be ready for a heavy handed dose of female melodrama. This book definitely has it bright spots but they are almost always eclipsed by the female characters constant back and forth banter. If you buy this book you would be better served skip large portions of the book when ever Egwene or any other of the female characters goes on a rant."

Are we to believe that the male characters are effecting changes in the world that will rock it to its very foundation, yet they can't tell these women to get off their backs?  The rare (and I mean RARE) women in these books that are straight-shooters always seem to get the shaft."

And not just in Tar Valon, but the other side of the Spine of the World, as a rogue group of Aiel are rampaging toward the Dragonwall under the leadership of one claiming to be He Who Comes With The Dawn himself.

The descriptions of emotional pain were so visceral at times I was afraid to pick it back up, because I wasn't sure my heart could handle it. But the descriptions of pleasure are too, and of art, and of love, and of loss, and God, this was just beautiful. For me, the ending was unquestionably too neat, but I'm not gonna lie - I was secretly grateful for it. Definitely one of my favorites of the year."
950,I'll Give You the Sun,0803734964,Jandy Nelson,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Anonymous,"I just finished reading this and I'm already going through withdrawals. This book is relatively short, (under 300 pages) but you won't notice that while reading it. It's so full of life being lived and love being loved and lost being found. It feels like it's 3 years long. Which it is. It's been a long time since a novel has made me feel so much, so many, emotions. I ached, yearned, and rejoiced right alongside the characters. Thanks to Noah, I know just how to describe how reading this made me feel. Reading this book is like buckets and buckets of sunlight being poured over your head. This is NOT a YA book. It is a beautiful work of art, that will be appreciated, wholeheartedly, by anyone who loves art, and life, and love, and beautiful heartbreak, and the ties that bind us, in death, in life, in humanity.

The unique way the story was written was so well done, I did not put down the book once from when I had started it until I reached the end. I did not simply feel like I knew or understood the characters; I lived and breathed the characters. Everythng they felt, I felt along with them. I was happy and confused and angry and giddy and sad and excited and hurt and laughing and in love. Nothing felt forced and it was an exciting read thriughout. There were moments when I rushed so quickly to see what would happen next that i had to consciously slow myself down to fully appreciate the artistry annd detail in the novel. Nothing was predictable until it neared the end, and even then I was thrown a few surprises. The story was passionate, powerful, and inspirational. I would quickly recommend this to anyone (13 and up) because of the message. It encourages you to be yourself and to accept others for who they are. For me, as an avid reader, this is my favorite read since John Green. Please please read this book."

Each and every one of these men are guardian-protector heroes and it's fabulous experiencing every one of their happily-ever-afters. I hope with the story of their leader that this isn't the end of the series. We met a few more in this one and I need to find out about them all.

Lieutenant Colonel Benedict Draven meets his long lost Portuguese wife, Catarina Ana Marcia Neves, and another finds another survivor! He seems to collect them being the leader of the ""suicide troup"" in England's army against Napoleon. The Survivors are not just the ones who survived from the troop but true heros who rise to help those who need. But with this story we find he's a guardian-protector of those he is responsible for including his long lost wife. He's often wondered how she was doing when he couldn't find her after the war. She pops back into his life with no explanation demanding an annulment so she can marry someone else. Seems he married her in the midst of the war to protect her from an abusive contracted fiance and father. Her ""story"" about the annulment doesn't add up and he's determined to find out what's up. She's being blackmailed and Draven comes to the rescue. Catarina has become a lace maker, a very highly sought after lace maker, who's lace is in high demand. It's a work of art and called ""Catarina Lace"" and known throughout Europe! Juan Carlos de la Fuente is a competitor trying to gain control over her business by marrying her off to his desolate son Miguel. With the help of a few of his men they get to the bottom of what's wrong and remove the danger to her. 

Thank you Shana for a copy of this story for my voluntary and honest review. I am looking forward to reading more about these survivors."
951,Survivor,009928264X,Chuck Palahniuk,Barnes and Noble,5,abimus86,"I voluntarily read an Advanced Reader Copy of this book and the views expressed are my honest opinions. The Claiming of the Shrew is Shana Galen’s fifth instalment of The Survivors. Everyone familiar with Ms. Galen’s series surely knows about Lieutenant Colonel Benedict Draven. In fact, he is wildly sought after by matchmaking mamas. What is unknown to all, including his Survivors, is that Benedict married a fiery Portuguese ‘peasant’ girl, Catarina Neves, and left her behind in Portugal in order to help her from an abusive arranged marriage. Although he had tried to get in touch, she had moved away from her native village. Little did Benedict expect to return home one evening and find Catarina waiting for him.
Catarina was too intelligent and intense for the dull peasant life her father had chosen for her. Her determination was what made her succeed at getting married and succeeding at her job, that of lacemaking. Under the guidance and tuition of a kind soul, Catarina managed to create a wildly sought-after art. However, the greed of others was the main factor in her reunion with her husband. Together with her sister Ines, her “business partner” and his son, they travel to London so that Catarina could get an annulment. But when she is in danger, Benedict and his men come to the rescue.
Benedict has been a recurrent character in the Survivors’ books. Obviously, he is the reason for the whole troop. It is lovely to finally see him get a chance at love. Those matchmaking mamas never stood a chance! Ms. Galen found his perfect match in Catarina. A strong leader deserves a strong woman. The thing I like the most is that despite his extensive war experience, Benedict was constantly doubting himself and his abilities with regards to Catarina. This is to show that although a person might seem invincible, they too can be vulnerable at times. Will Catarina find she prefers the life of a businesswoman to that of a wife?
This book can be read on its own, but it is more fun if the previous books are read beforehand."
951,Survivor,009928264X,Chuck Palahniuk,Barnes and Noble,5,121667,"NOT SHAKESPEARE
I have read nearly all of this author’s work. This has been one of my favorites. The story of Catarina and Benedict was engaging and easy to follow. Benedict is a former war hero and Catarina with a tiny bit of help created a life and prosperous business for herself. This historical story reflects this era of #MeToo as Catarina struggles with whether she will be believed about her assaults. As a historical romance I think the comment is that women have been struggling with this issue for a lot longer than the media has been paying attention to it. Ms. Galan has done a great job of providing a story about this difficult struggle for women, while also staying true to her writing style and the series. It was truly about their falling in love and the obstacles tackled together. 
I love reading series with familiar characters, however in this story the the drop in of previous characters was minimal. If you haven’t read any previous books you can start here. I received this book as an ARC in exchange for this review."
952,"Shopaholic & Baby (Shopaholic, #5)",0385338708,Sophie Kinsella,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"I found myself laughing out loud throughout Becky's adventures in pregnancy. From her obsession with shopping in all the chic baby boutiques, to ordering online and from the glossy upscale catalogues, to investing in &quot;antiques of the future&quot; for her baby's portfolio, Becky was in fine form. Now working (more or less) as a personal shopper at a laughingstock of a store, Becky finds ways to make it soar while enlisting the help of an old friend. Familiar characters like Suz, Mr. and Mrs. Bloomwood, Janice, Tom, Jess, and of course Luke, are all featured prominently as Becky goes in search of the A-list obstetrician, the choice of all the glam people, only to discover she is Luke's ex-girlfriend and still carries a torch for him. SHOPAHOLIC &amp; BABY is one misunderstanding after another, although it begins to look like maybe Becky isn't really misunderstanding anything at all. Is Luke really having an affair With Venetia? Will Becky allow this woman to deliver her baby? And what about all those baby strollers she bought? Will she be able to keep them all?  Quite simply, it is funny, believable and has a mother who readers should be able to relate to - or actually a mother-to-be. From the first days of pregnancy to other decisions, large and small, she is eccentric and lovable, in her own quirky way, fuming at her husband as he juggles business and HER needs, getting in debates with him about whether to learn the gender of the baby during an ultrasound, etc..great read. Trust me..."
952,"Shopaholic & Baby (Shopaholic, #5)",0385338708,Sophie Kinsella,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,While I have enjoyed previous Shopaholic books we could have done without this one.  Becky is so incredibly stupid you just can't believe the things she does.  She is a spoiled brat and so obsessed with herself.  The inaccuracies regarding pregnancy were appauling as well.  No one gets an epidural while they are in labor and who would believe her water had broken when it really hadn't.  Stick to shopping!
952,"Shopaholic & Baby (Shopaholic, #5)",0385338708,Sophie Kinsella,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"My main issue with this book is that the main character never seems to learn anything from her mishaps in previous books. Thus, it seems as if I'm reading the exact same book repeatedly.  There is no growth in her  she makes the same mistakes over and over and over.  I hope the next book in the series finds her just a little wiser and a little more mature."
953,"The Dark Tower (The Dark Tower, #7)",1416524525,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.3,CarleCJ,"To be honest, Steven King gave you all the option you had the good happy ending and you could have stopped there so I don't know why so many people complain about reading on when he clearly warns you will be dissapointed in the book and that it would be tragic. That said I actually really liked the ending and wanted to have that chill going down my spine, after all it is a horror book and the reason why I read them. Love it all and I loved the epic last line."

Got interested when my high school teacher (5 yrs ago) gave me song of susannah to read. The ending isn't bad either. I bet most people don't get the ending and there for don't like it. But Stephen King gave Roland a SECOND chance. Where as he never had the horn before, he had then. That's what I believe anyways."
953,"The Dark Tower (The Dark Tower, #7)",1416524525,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"I haven't read another series that has captured me the way Stephen King has in this series.  I love how he created this world which is beyond my imagination. I've spent the past 4 months or so on this series, and I'm disappionted for it to end, but it was a good ending.  I was in shock on how it ended, but it was a perfect ending for this ka-tet.  The DT #7 would have to be my favorite out of the series, even though there were some parts that angered me, and drew tears, but still my favorite.  I will be reading this series again!!"
954,Twilight Director's Notebook : The Story of How We Made the Movie Based on the Novel by Stephenie Meyer,0316070521,Catherine Hardwicke,Barnes and Noble,4.1,GeorgeBeahm,"A pocket-sized (5.25 x 8.25 inch) hardback book, in full color, with hundreds of photographs and illustrations (including storyboards), this book delivers exactly what it promises: a ""Director's Notebook"" that tells ""the story of how we made the movie."" Hardwicke's journey on this film, as she has made clear in numerous interviews, was an adventure: shooting on location under weather conditions that included driving rain, sleet, numbing cold, or various combinations thereof, hardy Hardwicke persevered to deliver a film that far exceeded box office and studio expectations. 

This book is a behind-the-scenes look at how Hardwicke envisioned the movie from start to finish: a rare glimpse at a film maker's diary, complete with Hardwicke's own sketches (she was an architect before she became a film director), handwritten notes, candid photos from the movie, conceptual artwork, storyboards (black-and-white drawings that frame a shot for the camera), and film stills. 

The result is an intimate book, one in which Hardwicke's infectious enthusiasm makes you appreciate just how difficult it is to produce a movie--much less one shot on location under such challenging (an understatement) conditions. 

Fans who want a nuts-and-bolts ""Making of"" will certainly want to buy the authorized film book, TWILIGHT: THE COMPLETE ILLUSTRATED MOVIE COMPANION. (It's excellent, thorough, and at 8.5 x 11 inches, shows off the full color photos very well.) But this little gem belongs right next to it on the bookshelf. 

PS: It should be noted that Hardwicke chose not to helm NEW MOON because she felt the budget was inadequate and there wasn't sufficient time allowed to shoot what is obviously a more demanding (film-wise) movie than TWILIGHT. More's the pity. Chris Weitz is certainly up to the challenge, but I really felt Hardwicke's sensibilities made her the ideal choice to for all four Twilight films. 

We don't have Hardwicke on NEW MOON, but we do have this little gem of a book, which is really her extended love letter to the TWILIGHT movie, to Stephenie Meyer, and the small army of people that were mobilized to bring it to the screen."
954,Twilight Director's Notebook : The Story of How We Made the Movie Based on the Novel by Stephenie Meyer,0316070521,Catherine Hardwicke,Barnes and Noble,4.1,AnnieAM,"This was a pretty cool book that had some interesting information about how the novel was turned into a movie. It answered a lot of questions about the creative choices that they made while making the movie. However, I felt cheated to spend money on this when there was nothing in the book that isn't already in the extra documentary that's on the Twilight DVD's extra features. It had a few extra drawings and sketches, etc. but overall there wasn't much information in it that wasn't in the documentary. For that reason, I'd say that if you've seen the documentary, there isn't much of a point to buy this book unless (like me) you are a die-hard Twilight fan who simply must own everything Twilight :)"

956,"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!: Adventures of a Curious Character",0393316041,Richard Feynman,Barnes and Noble,4.2,lizzie_e,"I am a student in the 10th grade and, although I never would have picked this on my own, based on the content and the little information I knew about it before i started reading it, I really enjoyed this book! I had to read this book for my 10th grade honors physical science class, and was pleasantly surprised! I was dreading having to read it (I'm not much of a nonfiction/scientific reader, I like light reads), but this book made it interesting, not boring to read about Richard Feynman's encounters in the scientific world.The topics covered in this novel are nothing I ever would have suspected to interest me, but I was surprised to find that I did not actually mind reading this book. Basically Richard Feynman is retelling and recounting upon his most intriguing journeys and the memorable circumstances he has been in. It chronicles his life from the beginning, as Feynman shares his exciting personal experiences with you. It reads as though you and Mr. Feynman are sitting down, sharing funny, memorable stories with each other, a very smooth read. When reading, I almost forgot that I was reading this for an assignment, because of the way the information is presented in such a relaxed, casual way. It is a bit lengthy, but it's just interesting enough that you'll want to keep turning those pages until you've reached the end. I would highly recommend this to anyone, assigned or not!"
956,"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!: Adventures of a Curious Character",0393316041,Richard Feynman,Barnes and Noble,4.2,crazy4karate,this book is not just another book only about science. it has a lot of backround in it. i read this for a science class project and it was very entertaining. it was a book that i just kept reading and reading and i couldnt put it down! Dr. Feynman retells his life which is just so entertaining to read because he lead a full life. As i read i just gouldnt help but laugh out loud. i deffinatly recomend this book for anyone who likes science but loves a good laugh as well.

957,"Linger (The Wolves of Mercy Falls, #2)",0545123283,Maggie Stiefvater,Barnes and Noble,4.3,theReader278,I loved reading this wonderful book! It is a story that keeps you entertained for hours.
957,"Linger (The Wolves of Mercy Falls, #2)",0545123283,Maggie Stiefvater,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Scarls17,"When I finished Shiver in 2009, I immediately ordered a copy and had it sent to my sister. When she finished it, she texted me and said, ""I just finished Shiver. Now I must die."" That's how Maggie Stiefvater's books work: they're so good that you're left destroyed until you can somehow manage to push the words to the back of your head until you can find the time to process what you just read.


Shiver was my absolute favorite book of 2009 so when I got the chance to read an advanced copy of Linger, I screamed. I got the package and screamed! (As a side note, I have now shot myself in the foot since I will now need to wait even longer for Forever, the third and final book in the Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy.


Linger continues where Shiver left off: Grace and Sam have finally found each other and everyone is happy and content...yeah right! Grace's parents are not happy and want to keep Grace from Sam, Sam is struggling with his past as a wolf and the friends and family he won't see again, Isabel is still dealing with the loss of her brother to the wolves, and we as the reader have to deal with Cole, an exciting and complex character.


Sometimes the 2nd of a three book series can read as just a continuation of the story with no real excitement or story arc of its own. That is NOT the case with Linger. Stiefvater brilliantly introduces new characters, voices, and plots that add to the depth of everyone we fell in love with in Shiver.


My anticipation for Shiver's sequel was like Grace's longing for Spring and Linger read like a warm day on a hammock: I loved every minute of it."
957,"Linger (The Wolves of Mercy Falls, #2)",0545123283,Maggie Stiefvater,Barnes and Noble,4.3,A_Good_Addiction,"Linger easily withholds the same overall tone, intensity and beauty that shone brightly in Shiver, engulfing the reader instantly. The strong characters developed in Shiver return just as vividly, their personalities pulling through and progressing more in response to new characters and situations. Maggie's characteristic, notable, highly fluid and gorgeous writing continues to lull the readers, weaving emotional, connection and intimacy throughout. She slips in stunning oxymoronic descriptions, creating an overall beautiful picture no matter the moment, setting, or emotions.

Grace, while well developed already, continues to hold her same individuality. The chapters in her POV give perfect insight, understanding easily not only her feelings for and need towards Sam but her overall view of the world. Even at her less than shining moments, Grace is a very striking character. Her strong beliefs and views, attitudes and opinions continue to forge her through the events in Linger.

Sam is impossibly more complex after the events of Shiver, learning to live and move past everything that's happened. His heart is still mending, his loyalties both bound and splitting, and his core character coming through strongly even when the POV is not his own. He is as lovable and affectionate as in Shiver, understanding both the world and Grace in surprising ways. His maturity continues to grow and be showcased, as does the depth to which he loves Grace.

Cole is a new character to the world, and one as complex and well developed as the star lovers. Sarcastic and flippant, he tests Grave and Sam and adds a certain spark to the overall tone. The reader gets an intimate look into his mind, his personality coming out at a steady pace and with the same lyrical descriptions that defines Maggie's inherent, brilliant writing. He is a strongly contrast character to many already seen and his interactions, specifically with Isabelle, are fantastic to read.

Isabelle is also back, her responses and motivations continuing to surprise the readers. She is a very give and take character, a spitfire in some areas and a follower in others. With sections now in her perspective, the reader will get an even better look at her life and views, as well as form the same intense connection with her they already feel with Sam and Grace.

The plot is surprising, playing on events hinted at and brought up in Shiver but extending them, while also adding in new ones. The full meaning of what it means to be one of these wolves, the way their lives play out, and the ultimate future of it is both beautiful and heartbreaking. The caveats, nuances and unknowns about it are also brought very much to light. There is never a dull moment, a drifting pace, or a needless scene. Everything is in there for a reason, woven together masterfully even when the reader doesn't realize it. The events pull together for a shocking, blow out ending that is magnanimously jarring.

Linger is a step above Shiver, building on an already valiant world. The overall thought, effort and detail that has gone into the entire world is showcased, as is Maggie's story telling abilities and inherent writing style. The ending is a cliff hanger, tying up some events but leaving distracting, mind-grabbing ones open for the next book."
959,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,0142437344,"James Joyce, Seamus Deane",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"This James Joyce's most personal novel written about one man's impressionable childhood and follows him through to his college years as he comes to a greater understanding of individualism and intellectulal freedom and throws off the limitations of his catholic upbringing.  The novel is a masterpiece of writing style that defies time and place and becomes a book of everlasting, and everpresent importance.  The book is written in a stream of conscience style (somewhat similar to Dostoevsky but more so) that can at times be difficult to follow.  This is certainly not your typical beach reading, or grocery line novel.  A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is a terribly moving novel, but it must be read with great patience, and presence of mind.  You have to be willing to work for it to feel the true and indescribable force of this novel.  The novel is required reading for any serious reader."
959,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,0142437344,"James Joyce, Seamus Deane",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"James Joyce is one of the world's greatest authors of all time. He wrote poetry and prose and, in his final book, Finnegans Wake, created his own language. This book is a great tale of Stephen Deadalus through his early life that, in analysis, provides a 'portrait' of the young James Joyce. Probably Joyce's best book for the beginner Joyce-fan, this Penguin Putnam Classic is fully annotated by an ingenious scholar to help the reader who does not understand all of Joyce's plays on words and tricks. This is essential for everyone's personal library!"
959,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,0142437344,"James Joyce, Seamus Deane",Barnes and Noble,3.9,songcatchers,"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is ranked by the Modern Library as the third greatest English-language novel of the twentieth century. I have no idea why. I just found it to be extremely boring. The book is the semi-autobiographical coming of age of Stephen Dedalus, the alter ego of James Joyce. From his questions and anxiety over the roles of women and his dealings with them to his on-again-off-again struggles with religion, A Portrait of the Artist...just didn't keep my interest. It's not a bad story really but I just did not dig the prose. I haven't given up on James Joyce yet but I really hope his other books won't put me to sleep."
960,"The Gathering Storm (Wheel of Time, #12)",0765302306,"Robert Jordan, Brandon Sanderson",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"Unlike most other reviews here (as of this posting), I have read this book.  All of the book and not just the prologue and the first chapter.

Fans of the Wheel of Time series will not be disappointed with The Gathering Storm.  Unlike some of the books since Lord of Chaos, there is a satisfactory conclusion to an important plot line in this book (no spoilers).  There is clear movement towards Tarmon Gai'don.  No more burying major characters under roof beams and leaving them there for a full book.  While not all characters are visited, you still put the book down feeling that something momentous had happened and you don't feel the lack of particular story lines.  Instead of feeling as if I had just briefly flitted from character to character without accomplishing anything, this book provides a sense of satisfaction that has been missing from some of the prior Wheel of Time novels. (That is not a knock on the prior books, The Gathering Storm would not feel as satisfactory without the build up provided by the books that preceded it.)

I will say that I was worried at the beginning of the Prologue.  It certainly does not start with a bang, but it does set the tone for the book.  However, by the end of the prologue I knew that this was a book where something exciting was going to happen and wanted to continue reading.

It is also worth noting that Sanderson has done a wonderful job of preserving the writing style of the previous books.  Is this book somewhat different from Jordan's original books?  Yes, most notably, the pacing is a bit faster.  It is debatable, however, whether that is a function of Sanderson's style or the fact that the plot is coming to a head.

This book is a worthy and welcome addition to the Wheel of Time series.  Although it is sad that Robert Jordan could not write all of it himself, The Gathering Storm is a fantastic addition to his legacy."
960,"The Gathering Storm (Wheel of Time, #12)",0765302306,"Robert Jordan, Brandon Sanderson",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Gaidin,"to be honest I just expected this book to finish the storyline and tie up loose ends without jordans flair. yes i read chapter 1 and the prolouge early and was not that impressed. At tor .com i listened to the audio of chapter 2 early and i think this is where the book gets rolling. For all of you who say it doesn't read like robert jordan please read the whole book first. I just finished the book and i an back waiting for the next one as eagerly as ever. Yes the chrachters seem a little different at first but within a few chapters they blend almost seemlessly. I feel the reason people dislike the first few chapters is that a large number of new charachters are  are thrown at you which makes the book feel unfamiliar but as the book continues I felt like it was one of the better books in the series. This one feels like the early books in that the story actually moves forward at a good pace and you actually feel like it goes somewhere. The later books by jordan were great but slowed in momentum and just seemed to leave more unfinished storylines after every book. Finally after 19 years of reading the wheel of time countless times 
( at least 10 times minimum) I feel the end coming and know it will be an ending of heroic proportions. Brandon Sanderson has done the monumental task of stepping into the giant shadow cast by Robert Jordan and from reviews I have read no one seems to think him worthy after reading only 1 or 2 chapters. Well for all you who made a hasty judgement please read the whole book and then decide. I feel Brandon Sanderson deserves great praise for this book and he has definately deserves a thank you from all wheel of time fans for stepping into the breach and finishing the story we all wanted to know the ending to.Now as all wheel of time fans are used to doing i will wait another year for the next book in that end. Yep definately feels like Robert Jordan."

Mr. Sanderson does a wonderful job of MOVING the story along without getting dragged down into the weeds too much.  The pace is fairly quick for a story with so many characters, and several answers are provided in this book that give closure to questions that have loomed for four or five books."
961,Middlemarch,0451529170,"George Eliot, Michel Faber",Barnes and Noble,4.1,lraber224,"Do NOT waste your money on this edition of Middlemarch. There are seriously at least 50 typos that I found.

Your money and time will be much better spent on another edition."
961,Middlemarch,0451529170,"George Eliot, Michel Faber",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"I can understand how some readers might become overwhelmed by the 700 plus pages that make up this classic but its well worth the read. George Eliot reminds me of an Austen or Bronte, but with a little more spunk. Everything doesn't always work out perfectly for Eliot's characters and their lives are more complicated and true to life. Dr. Lydgate and Dorthea begin with the best of intentions but their ambitions are soon spoiled through their own folly and misjudgement. The book is a great depiction of human strenghths and weaknesses set in a climate of strict social heirarchy."
961,Middlemarch,0451529170,"George Eliot, Michel Faber",Barnes and Noble,4.1,HBW,"This edition of Middlemarch has one of the best introductions to a classic I've ever read--clearly written, informative and free of the pompous nonsense you usually see in these (definitely read it after reading the novel, though; it gives away all the plot points). Because of this alone, I'd say this edition is more than worth the money. On the other hand, it did have a good number of typos. The book was apparently scanned with optical character recognition, judging by their nature. I found it readable, but if you're a stickler for such things, you might want to avoid this edition. Another drawback was the footnotes. They were too sparse, and a handful weren't properly tagged to jump to the footnote section. These aren't fatal flaws, but they keep reminding you you're not reading a top-notch edition. Still, for the money, I'm not sure you could do better."
962,"Point of Retreat (Slammed, #2)",0000000000,Colleen Hoover,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Miss_Sonya,"Point of Retreat is equally intense and just as powerful as its predecessor Slammed. This is the only book I've ever read that had me bawling and laughing out loud at the same time. Like the first book in this sequel, Slammed, Point of Retreat had me bawling my eye's out and took me on an intense emotional journey about family, friendship, life and love. This book seriously needs to come with a disclaimer warning readers to be ready to cry a lot! (It's really hard to get through a book when your tears are flooding your eye's chapter after chapter). The fact that Point of Retreat is well written and because it made such an impact on me, I would give it well over 5 stars."
962,"Point of Retreat (Slammed, #2)",0000000000,Colleen Hoover,Barnes and Noble,4.6,JodyFL,"Point of Retreat is the continuing story of Wil and Layken's romance that began in Slammed.  As the book opens, Layken's Mom has passed away 3 months ago.  She and Wil have fallen into a rhythm of college classes, caring for their little brothers, and seeing each other.  As the new semester begins a person from Wil's past will stir up trouble for him and Lake.  Again, I feel these books are so good that I don't want to give too much of the plot away because that is one of the best parts of this book was letting it unfold to me.  Lake begins to question whether Wil loves her because of their similar circumstances or if he really loves her for herself.  Life continues to throw curves their way that they must navigate.  
I loved this book as much as the first and it was so fun to have this one told from Wil's POV.  By the end of the two books I felt satisfied and even closer to the characters.   I would recommend this series to everyone that loves romance.  The love story is touching and real.  Both Slammed and Point of Retreat will be on my keeper shelf for re-reading!"
962,"Point of Retreat (Slammed, #2)",0000000000,Colleen Hoover,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"This was good, but not as good as Slammed.  Not thrilled with the ending, too abrupt after waiting so long to see what happens.  This one is told from the guys' point of view,  I think I prefer Lake telling the story."
963,The Partner,0385339100,John Grisham,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"I am a great Grisham fan but this book left a lot to be desired.  Hard to follow.  Story was unbelievable.
Would not recommend."
963,The Partner,0385339100,John Grisham,Barnes and Noble,3.9,baroquem on LibraryThing,"This was the first John Grisham novel I read, and I think it was a bad choice. I did not enjoy this book. The fundamental problem is that the protagonist, Patrick, is a wholly unsympathetic character: once we get past the initial torture scenes, we're left with a man who cares nothing about his family, fakes his own death, steals a large sum of money, then spends most of the book manipulating the legal system to try to walk away with as much loot as he can. Are we supposed to feel sorry for him? Admiration for his  escapades? For me, it was a total misfire. And at the end of the story, Grisham throws one final twist that is perhaps intended to satisfy those who see injustice in Patrick's escape to freedom. Unfortunately, the twist is so arbitrary, going against everything we know about the characters, that it rings false and leaves the reader scratching his head in confusion. Not quite the effect the author was hoping for, I suspect."
963,The Partner,0385339100,John Grisham,Barnes and Noble,3.9,amurphy98 on LibraryThing,I've wanted to read this book for years and finally got the chance. The story is well written and held my attention. The ending surprised me though. What's the ultimate moral of the story?
965,"Thoughtless (Thoughtless, #1)",146109111X,S.C. Stephens,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"So I'll start by saying this the book started as a solid 5 star read for me. Before I even began, I was convinced I was in for a damn good read. The premise was excellent and hen all the great reviews I was stoked!

 As I started reading I felt there was way too much info dump but then I thought okay maybe it's just that I'm anxious to see how the love triangle begins since Denny is so wonderful. How would it even be possible? I started skimming to get to the juicy part of the story. And the writer delivered. I had noticed how often Kiera blushed but it didn't really bother at first because I thought maybe that's her cute quirk. Heroine's often have one. Obviously she blushes A LOT. But by the time she'd blushed about 20 times The story went from a solid 5 to a weak 5.

 But the story was still good. So 5 it stayed. Then I started noticing the author's love of adverbs. At first, it was in all the tags which I find to be VERY weak writing. The author chooses to tell me how everyone said everything rather than show me.

He said cautiously. 
I said softly. 
I smiled goofily. <- really? 

After about, I don't know, 30 of these and the read had gone done to a 4 star. But the story still had me. So I read on. The more I read the more the excessive use of adverbs began to irritate me and at this point I began to roll my eyes at the amount of time Kiera blushed and blushed deeply. Note to author you can't say ""I blushed"" because no one can see themselves blush. However instead of TELLING the reader she blushed you could've (especially since she did it so often, many times at things that didn't even warrant blushing) you could show us. ""I felt my cheeks warn."" ""The heat rushed to my face."" But no, the author took the annoyingly lazy way out and chose to tell us about every single time she blushed or blushed deeply.

 It seems as the story went on (which could've been so much shorter and written much tighter if SO much of the unnecessary details would have been left out.) The authors love of adverbs grew as passionately <- heh as Kiera and Kellans love did. The adverbs became more blatant. And were suddenly EVERYWHERE and even more than once in a single sentence like in this offensive one. 
He smiled goofily as he tilted his head adorably. uugh!

 We're down to 3 stars now folks. Every adverb at this point made me cringe, which meant I never stopped cringing! 

Then as if that weren't enough the author just began to repeat the same ones over and over. 
He looked at me icily then turned coldly. 
Dangerously 
Uncertainly 
I said moodily. <- are you kidding me?! I almost screamed at that one! lol 

VERY lazy writing when the you choose to just say angrily rather than try to come up with a more creative way to show he was angry. ""He stomped away, red faced slamming the door behind him."" Nope, it's much easier to just tell us he left angrily!!! 

I was generous with the half star. After I read the consequences I'd had enough and didn't even finish. Sad because the story had such promise."

Stephens,Barnes and Noble,4.5,lovergirlOS,loved fifty shades of grey and then I read beautiful disaster and I kept reading books in the hopes that I would find another book that was like one of these two and this book was FANTASTIC and In my opinion it was better than beautiful disaster! If anyone was like me and you loved fifty shades or beautiful disaster then you need to read this book ASAP!!!!
965,"Thoughtless (Thoughtless, #1)",146109111X,S.C. Stephens,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Eroticalover1,"Kira starts out as a solid character and then just falls a part. I mean if I can get through all the blushes and  heated checks I made me so sick in the end I wanted to gag. This book takes way ,way too long to get to where it's going. Your really fine with screwing you boyfriend's best friend when he's away and then he comes back. You start sleeping with your boyfriend meanwhile your kissing and snuggling with his best friend but that's okay as long as your not having sex with him it's okay. Really? I would have loved this book if Kira and kellan had a juicy affair behind  Denny's back. This book is like bad Fanficton. . read Beautiful Disaster instead."
966,Presumed Innocent,0446350982,Scott Turow,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Camboron,"This could have been two novels--the man obsessed with his former co-worker and mistress, or a fast-paced summer read mystery. The fact that Scott Turow pulled off both and put them together makes it understandable why this book was so successful on its first release. I really was expecting to breeze through it, like most mysteries out there that are so popular, but was surprised at how long the book was, comparatively. And, I did not expect the rich inner life of Rusty, and how he dealt with everything going on. I also did not predict whodunit. I love being surprised about those kind of things. The detail, the length of flashbacks, explanations, obsessing, lent so much to the mystery that one really invested in the characters. Most of the time, in mysteries, things just happen, and you race through the pages waiting for the next visceral thrill. You are excited, and your pulse races, but, when the book is over, you have nothing left to do, but come down from the thrill. At the end of Presumed Innocent, I felt how I do after a novel, wondering about the future of the characters, their families' + that pulse-racing thrill. It's a combination hardly ever experienced in popular thrillers. I can't wait to read the next Kindle County mystery.
My only qualms is that, it's not for those who want a quick mystery read, and some might think the book couldn't make up its mind. Also, all the ""faggot"" and ""queer"" jokes are a little jarring, until you realize it was written in 1988. Enjoy"
966,Presumed Innocent,0446350982,Scott Turow,Barnes and Noble,3.9,lov2readSM,"I love mysteries and ""who-done-it"" novels, and this one kept me guessing for most of the book. The story line was good, but the way it is written takes a bit of concentration to keep characters straight in the beginning. There is some pretty graphic writing with some of the scenes that I didn't find necessary to make the story interesting. On my personal scale of 1 to 10, I'd rate this one a 7."
966,Presumed Innocent,0446350982,Scott Turow,Barnes and Noble,3.9,gl,"I first read Presumed Innocent almost fifteen years ago. I'd been thinking of going to law school and Presumed Innocent is on the list of books that many law schools send you the summer before you begin studying. I remember thinking that the book spent more time on legal technicalities than the other thrillers that I'd read. Reading Presumed Innocent with an eye to joining the profession gave it a certain air as well.

Now after years as an entirely different sort of lawyer, the detective work, legal technicalities and procedural law aspects continue to delight me. Though I've read the book and watched the movie and am vaguely aware that a twist is sure to come, Presumed Innocent draws me in as though it were completely new. Scott Turow's writing remains fresh and engaging.

Other reviewers have mentioned that the book has lost its impact for them, that they're not as impressed by it years later. I have a very different reaction to the book -- years later and after close to 15 years studying and practicing law, I find that Presumed Innocent has grown to be even more gripping and entertaining. Though you might have expected me to figure out the ending given that I'd read the book before and seen the movie, but the enjoyment comes from how Turow built up the suspense and described the trial. It's the execution of the concept that makes Presumed Innocent a legal thriller that will last for years to come. I'm very much looking forward to reading Turow's next book Innocent that comes out on May 4, 2010.

967,The Dark Half,045052468X,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"This is my favorte book. It has a great story line and is typical king gruesome. Couldnt put  the book down when i read it first. Nooks version, however, is laced with errors that are distracting from how wonderfully great the book is. A must read whether on nook or old fashioned with a paper book."
967,The Dark Half,045052468X,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Akeman,"I love this book, it is another great by Stephen King.  However, the NOOK Book or eBook is not worth the money.  The nook copy has a lot of problems that do not exist in the real copy, the worst of which is the spelling errors on every page that uses the wrong words.  

To me this book looks like someone used a bad OCR to scan the book and no one checked what had been scanned.  For exammple, in the book the word ""closed"" is used many times, but in the NOOK book it reads ""dosed"" every time.  Unfortunately, this happens with a number of letter combinations leading to wrong words on every page.  

So, my recomendation for anyone wanting to read this great book is to go buy a hard copy rather than wasting your money on an eBook with so many errors."
967,The Dark Half,045052468X,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.1,ArmyRPh,This is truly one of King's finest works.  It is also however the worst quality ebook I have paid for yet.  The number of typographical errors is staggering.  Nothing that actually affects the readability...but enough to make you question how Penguin could have the nerve to charge $7 for such a shoddy product.  I've downloaded Internet Project free books with fewer typos!  They should be ashamed.   Despite their attempts(Penguin's) to make this an unpleasant experience...the book is a must read/must own for any true Stephen King fan!  Thanks Stephen...I'm your biggest fan!  ; )
968,Cleopatra: A Life,0316001929,Stacy Schiff,Barnes and Noble,3.4,TracyHodson,"""Cleopatra: A Life"" is not scholarly enough to qualify as a biography--there simply isn't enough information extant about Cleopatra to fill a 300+ page book. All her sources wrote well past Cleopatra's time, or were Roman enemies. Schiff acknowledges the almost total lack of reliable information right from the start, but can't quite overcome the enormity of that obstacle. Her prose is often stilted as she fills pages with everything but Cleopatra's life. We learn what her education probably consisted of, what the people of Alexandria ate and therefore what Cleopatra probably ate; she fills page after page with sentences beginning with ""she probably"", ""she may have,"" ""she might have,"" ""we can guess she..."" This becomes both frustrating and tedious to read. The first half of the book deals with all but the last years of Cleopatra's life, the ten years with Antony, but as there is next to nothing known of these years, there's next to no substance being covered here. Schiff gives a lively picture of Alexandria, and a great deal of time is spent reading Cicero's denunciations of Cleopatra, but there's nothing new, nothing of very great interest, very little ""biography."" The second half of the book is about the years with Antony, and is dedicated to the exploration of that most intriguing of relationships, though Schiff doesn't seem to subscribe to the idea of theirs being a great romance. She doesn't really seem to have a point of view about many things, including the source of Cleopatra's great power over two of the greatest men of her age. Instead, she presents various accounts about all the major events of the last ten years of Cleopatra's life, during which she was Antony's faithful lover and mother to three children by him in addition to her son, Caesarion, by Julius Caesar (his only son and only living child), and Antony's eldest children by an early marriage. The details of their life together-as much as can be known-are covered well, and the tension mounts as they plummet headlong into war and the final, fatal, showdown with Octavian. All of this is well-written and interesting to read; clearly, when Ms. Schiff has something to write about, she writes well. And this is a story worth telling-- whether Cleopatra and Antony partnered out of passion, or politics, or both, it is certainly one of the great couplings of all time. The bewildering and disastrous Battle of Actium, Cleopatra's building of her own Mausoleum, Antony's botched suicide and subsequent death in Cleopatra's arms are the stuff of high opera. Octavian's cold, ruthless gamesmanship versus Cleopatra's determined, intelligent survivalism made for a dramatic end-game, regardless of the veracity of the varying accounts (poison or an unlikely, very handy, cobra? Cleopatra's suicide or murder by Octavian?). In the end the book is neither scholarly enough to qualify as a biography, nor well-enough presented to qualify as a good read. Schiff reads no Greek or Latin, and does not appear to have traveled to any of the areas she's written about or visited museums to talk with scholars or to see artifacts that may have helped her to get a real handle on her subject. There is no new information, and Schiff gets a bit side-tracked by her irritation with Liz Taylor for having played Cleopatra on screen, hardly an important detail for a serious biographer. There seems to be a great deal of effort going into promoting this book, but it just isn't a very creditable effort."
968,Cleopatra: A Life,0316001929,Stacy Schiff,Barnes and Noble,3.4,FeatheredQuillBookReviews,"Full disclosure: My Ph.D. dissertation (Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, 1976) was an examination of the persona of Cleopatra in the plays in English about her from 1592 to 1898, including the famous plays by Shakespeare, Dryden, and Shaw. While Stacy Schiff uses the same resources I did-primarily the Roman and early Christian propagandists-she also has the advantage of books published as recently as 2008. The level of her scholarship is one thing that makes this book so good. It includes maps of Alexandria and the Mediterranean world in Cleopatra's day, extensive notes, and color plates of statues and coins that show us what the queen may have looked like. Some years ago there was a movement to reclaim ancient Egypt's people and civilization for sub-Saharan Africa. It's possible that the pyramid builders were black Africans, but Cleopatra was no more Egyptian, Schiff writes, than Elizabeth Taylor. The queen was Macedonian Greek. The founder of the Ptolemaic Dynasty was a childhood friend of Alexander the so-called Great and founder of the great city of Alexandria (which is now mostly under water). The Ptolemies engaged not only in patricide, matricide, fratricide, and sororicide, but also in incest; in the opening chapters of Cleopatra, Schiff untangles the history and shenanigans of this dynasty, which puts the Borgias to shame, and describes its long and troubled relationship with the Roman Republic. Cleopatra is most famous, of course, for her love affairs with two of the most famous and more or less noblest Romans. Julius Caesar put her back on her throne in about 48 BCE after she'd been exiled by her brother (Ptolemy XIII) and his henchmen. She was in Rome in 44 when Caesar was assassinated and sailed home to Alexandria soon after the Ides of March. She probably met Mark Antony in Rome, but she didn't engage his interest until after he and Octavian (Caesar's heir) had dispatched Brutus and Cassius at Philippi in Asia Minor. Antony now summoned the queen to Tarsus. The events of the final years of Cleopatra's life, from the Donations of Alexandria (late 34) until her death in 30, were enormously complex. Schiff meticulously combs through the ancient sources to distinguish Roman propaganda from history. At the Donations, Antony gave Cleopatra the title Queen of Kings, promoted Caesarion to King of Kings, and gave their three children lands from Parthia (now northern Iran) to Cyrenaica (now Libya). To say the Donations angered Octavian is a vast understatement; the Roman civil war blazed up again and was not quenched until, following the battle of Actium in 31 from which the queen so famously sailed away, the Romans invaded Egypt and Antony and Cleopatra both killed themselves. With the death of the richest woman in the world, Octavian had no more competition. He renamed himself Augustus and founded the Roman Empire. Quill says: After you've read this beautifully researched and historically accurate biography, have some fun. Rent the bloated 1963 Elizabeth Taylor movie. Play film critic. Comment on the historical errors, the anachronisms, and the utter nonsense."
968,Cleopatra: A Life,0316001929,Stacy Schiff,Barnes and Noble,3.4,bookiecookie,"With all the hype surrounding a Pulitzer-prize-winning author coupled with my curiousity concerning this historical figure, I bought this book with great anticipation.  However, I really struggled to get through it and I am a person that will generally read -- and get something out of -- just about anything.  The synopsis of the book as presented in the BN listing tells just about as much as the entire book does and your high school classes in Ancient History tells you the rest.  I think I even learned more from Elizabeth Taylor.......  

While Schiff's research may be impeccable, it is a thumping bore to get through and at the end, we still don't learn much about Cleopatra that we didn't already know.  I wasn't expecting a tabloid page-turner but I also wasn't expecting a book that took such effort to just reach the end.  I can't honestly recommend it....."
969,The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century,0374292795,Thomas L. Friedman,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Bush_Man,"The book The World is Flat, by Thomas Friedman, is non-fiction, insightful book mainly about the author¿s personal experiences with the leveling of the world¿s communication and information transfer. Friedman explains to the reader through his experiences, a brief history of the 21st Century.  He outlines the world¿s flattening into three eras of globalization, ¿Globalization 1.0 was countries globalizing and the dynamic force in Globalization 2.0 was companies globalizing, the dynamic force in Globalization 3.0 ¿ the thing that gives it its unique character ¿ is the newfound power for individuals to collaborate and compete globally (10).¿  He explains the shifting of the world, from being isolated geographically, to a more integrated world that is dependant on the resources and information that countries around the world supply. ""It unlocked half the planet and made citizens there our potential partners and competitors (441).¿   The book helps the reader to understand the transition from the age of industry to the age of technology.	To better understand the man behind the book it is important to know about him. He is a very accomplished writer that won the three Pulitzer Prize for commentary for the New York Times, and has written: From Beirut to Jerusalem in 1989, The Lexus and the Olive Tree in 2000, Longitudes and Attitudes: The World in the Age of Terrorism in 2002, and Israel: A Photo biography. Most of which have won awards for best non-fiction or foreign policy. Most of Friedman¿s writings are based off the ideals of globalization, especially The World is Flat.	Thomas Friedman explains, in The World is Flat, how the world has shifted economically as far as the workforce because of the increasing need for math, science and technology as tools for progress, and the ability through technology for the United States to compete globally.  Through capitalism companies want to maximize their profits by hiring the most qualified people for the job with the least amount of money.  This is the whole concept of outsourcing and why American jobs are leaving the country.  In his book he says, ¿This is what I mean when I say the world has been flattened.  It is the contemporary convergence of the ten flatteners, creating this new global playing field for multiple forms of collaboration (177).¿ I feel that this is one hundred percent true and that the author did an excellent job of providing many examples and in depth analysis. There are many options that a business owner looks at and the clear choice in every scenario is to hire the smartest people to offer the highest quality product with the lowest labor cost possible.  This is shown throughout history that business owners always make the cheapest choice possible, even when it isn¿t morally right.  The whole concept of slavery or child labor is to maximize profit, even though we all know it is morally wrong.  Outsourcing isn¿t necessarily wrong.  It¿s just a smart business decision based on keeping labor costs down and today¿s technology allows companies to employ people across the world as though they were in the same building.  Proving my point Friedman explains, ¿Wages and rents in Bangalore are less than one fifth of what they are in those Western capitals (18).¿	Over all, I thought it was a very informative book that gives the reader a different perspective of how the different technologies that we take for granted now, like computers and internet are shaping the world.

My first day my Buiness Professor was talking about the cirrculum and mentioned that we should all take a look at this book. For some reason I took his advice and read this book that is some 600 plus pages'I never read prior to this unless force'.I did it not cause I was forced to but I wanted to learn and that is what Friedman tries getting across IQ,PQ,CQ Chapters. I am only 19 years old but I currently work in a hotel that caters to Multi Million dollar buisness such as EMC Corp and Waters Corp and I got to witness first hand that globalziation indeed is no joke and something we should not take lightly. I often interacted with many people from China,Japan,and India and I often found myself asking them how they felt about Globlization. All of them embraced it because it is a chance for these people to take what they learn bring it home and build on it. Globalization is nothing we should fear it something we should embrace.I also work with three India interns all of them have a work ethic like no other and they have that drive to be better. They could not understand why us americans throw away all the oppurtinutes we have,he told me to ask a child parents what it means to be an engineer or doctor and you will understand why we work everyday to get better. I am now going into my sophmore year of College and you best believe I am going to work study and network more than ever.If I dont I know that someone in China or India is this should be a serious reality check to all young adults.

When I mentioned I had never heard of it, they immediately gave me a synopsis of the story.  I was so impressed with their attitute toward the book, I bought my own copy for my son.  Yes, I understand the negative point of view that many have of this book, but it is also a positive book of making friends.  It makes for a great children's book.  By the way, I teach high school students who didn't even pick up on the ""communist"" view of the book.

I think that it's moral is quite clear, you should not conform to what everyone else wants or give up your identity just because people do not like it. Those of you saying that it's communist and just teaches children that they need to give things away to have friends need to look a little bit deeper, not just on the surface. Create a dialogue with your child about the book and what they think the moral is. It can teach them not only an important moral but how to think critically about literature and you get bonding time and a better understanding of how your child thinks."

There are a plethora of these titles in any bookstore, and unfortunately, many of them are just too abstract for the everyday person. What makes ""The Happiness Project"" so wonderful is that anyone can relate. Who doesn't want to be happy?

One year, Gretchen Rubin decides to forego the specific New Year's resolutions that so many of us break by January 3rd. Eat right, exercise more, watch less TV, blah, blah, blah. Instead, she decides that she wants to become happier. To accomplish this, she decides on 12 specific areas where she would like to become happier in her life, and then sets mini-goals for herself each month. For example, the area to be happier in May is ""Leisure"". Rubin's goals in May are find more fun, take time to be silly, go off the path, and start a collection.

I found myself laughing, nodding my head with understanding, and ""Ah-hah-ing"" at almost every page. I found the month about contemplating the heavens to be most profound. To be happier, read memoirs of catastrophe?? Yes, if you want to be happy with and appreciate what you have, read the diaries of people who have just been diagnosed with cancer or survived a plane crash. Maybe the little things in life (Why isn't he going the speed limit?) won't bother you as much. 

Journal writing is way too overwhelming for me to do each day. Rubin suggests a one-sentence journal, where you write one thing that happened that day that you never want to forget. It's the little things like these that make this book joyous to read and makes you think about starting your own happiness project. Don't worry, be _____.

973,"The Happiness Project: Or Why I Spent a Year Trying to Sing in the Morning, Clean My Closets, Fight Right, Read Aristotle, and Generally Have More Fun",0061583251,Gretchen Rubin,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Anonymous,"What a wonderful book to start the new year with, especially after a year like 2009, and no surprise that it's been chosen by Oprah's book club. Rubin's project can easily become your own as it's filled with practical tips, without being preachy, that anyone could do.  This is much more than self-help; it's a compulsively readable narrative, thanks to Gretchen's funny and insightful anecdotes (which also examine her shortcomings and failures alongside the happier successes) and thoughtful research ranging from Aristotle and Tolstoy to Ben Franklin and Samuel Johnson. I highly recommend checking out the happiness toolbox on Rubin's blog at happinessprojecttoolbox.com"
973,"The Happiness Project: Or Why I Spent a Year Trying to Sing in the Morning, Clean My Closets, Fight Right, Read Aristotle, and Generally Have More Fun",0061583251,Gretchen Rubin,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Anonymous,"I read this book for a book club I recently joined. It was really hard to get into because I felt like the author made it seem way too hard to be happy. The amount of research she did (and mentioned constantly) made me feel like I was reading a textbook at times. Near the middle of book, I began to like the author for being candid and honest.  I realized that her happiness project worked for her and I saw how others could be inspired by her.  Personally, I wrote down 3 things I wanted to do in the next year to make myself happier-organize my house, be nicer to my husband, and enjoy the time I do get to myself.  So overall, I got her message. I did not love the book, but I can see why others who need a little inspiration would."
974,The Man in the High Castle,0679740678,Philip K. Dick,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,"I don't like alternate history stories, dating back, I think, to when I was a kid and I read those stupid 'What If...' issues published by Marvel Comics.  (You know, 'What If Peter Parker hadn't been bitten by the radioactive spider...,''What If Daredevil wasn't blind...,''What If Wolverine shaved his sideburns...,' etc.)  The Man in the High Castle, however, was excellent, setting the bar for the genre.  The premise is intriguing: suppose an assassination attempt had claimed the life of FDR during his first term as president.  As a result, America never fully recovered from the Great Depression, and was unable to arm herself sufficiently to turn the tide of WWII.  As a result, the Axis powers were victorious, and occupied a divided United States after the war.  Dick ties together his diverse cast of characters with a common fascination with 'The Grasshopper Lies Heavy,' an alternative history book that suggests the Allies would have won the war had FDR lived.  Dick's central theme through most of his work has always been the nature of reality and perception, and this book is no exception.  This is not a book to skim through for the major plot points -- the plot is actually the least compelling reason to read it.  Savor the meditative and philosophical prose instead, and enjoy one of the genre's finest authors in his prime."
974,The Man in the High Castle,0679740678,Philip K. Dick,Barnes and Noble,3.7,tickleishpickle,"There are books out there that don't just challenge the reader, there are books that change the reader.

The man in the high castle, by philip k dick is one of those books. This book, like all of dick's writing, is revolutionary. It is challenging. It is completely and utterly bizzare. It is unique, difficult, simple, readable, entertaining, schizophrenic and so much more than any set of adjectives can covey.

This book is not about the plot. It's about what the plot means. The plot, like all of dick's novels, is cohesive and interesting and detailed. It is fully realized and detailed; it is completely authentic. In this world, the axis wins WW 2. The world that results is a world where Japan and Germany have divided the world in two, with the United States serving the role of Germany after our version of WW2. Japan dominates the west coast while Germany lords over the east. Apparently the heartland of America had nothing to offer to either side.

Jokes aside (especially bad jokes), this novel is an utterly amazing and philosophical exploration of the impact of morality on each and every choice. It uses the chaos of the plot to accentuate the moral decisions made by each character. In fact the chaos of the world this novel takes place in works as a sort of synecdoche for each person and each person's choices. The whole world is difficult, and each event impacts a web of other events. The world and it's events mirror each individual person, they stand in the place of each individual person. The plot unfolds through the narration of five people, ranging in importance from a low level worker to an important German politician. Each person makes choices, and each choice has a moral consequence.

974,The Man in the High Castle,0679740678,Philip K. Dick,Barnes and Noble,3.7,theactuallisakim,"I'm pretty shocked by some of the negative reviews here.  The word that controls most of these reviews is 'boring,' which is odd.  I suppose for a generation unable to watch a film that doesn't have an explosion of some sort within the first minute of the movie, a book like this might seem boring (then again, maybe we should be happy that Generation No Attention Span even bothered to pick up a book in the first place!)

This is one of the books PKD is best known for.  With good reason.  For those of you who didn't ""get"" what PKD's point was, he is simply asking you to question everything you are told about who the winners and losers in a war are.  I think the end of this book is one of the most chilling, disturbing conclusions I have ever read. Literally gave me goosebumps.  Then again, I can focus on something for more than three minutes at a time, so maybe, in this day and age, I'm some sort of freak!"
975,Helter Skelter: The True Story of the Manson Murders,0393322238,"Vincent Bugliosi, Curt Gentry",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Fuampa,"Great read. Would have given 5 stars if the Nook would show the images. ""Images in this book are not displayed owing to permissive issues"" That is frustrating."
975,Helter Skelter: The True Story of the Manson Murders,0393322238,"Vincent Bugliosi, Curt Gentry",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Mary_T,"I acknowledge that this story is horrific enough without the photos, but I was surprised when my ebook edition omitted them.  I could understand the technological issues attendant with including color photos, but the pics in the ""dead tree"" version are in black and white, so I don't understand why they weren't included in my ebook version.  I checked out the paper book while at Barnes and Noble.  The photos are not grotesque.  Certain aspects of the crime scene photos are prudently obscured.  But what I found fascinating were the photos of the young women who committed the murders.  Fresh-faced teenage girls smile out from the pages.  Manson looks like a feral leprechaun and one wonders why anyone would follow him anywhere much less murder for him.  The inclusion of the photos in the (not inexpensive) ebook version would have made this a better product."
975,Helter Skelter: The True Story of the Manson Murders,0393322238,"Vincent Bugliosi, Curt Gentry",Barnes and Noble,4.4,PhxKevin,"Helter Skelter is about Charles Manson who in 1969, along with his family of followers struck fear in the heart of all America.  The darker side of the hippie movement the sixties were known for.  Vincent Bugliosi does a great job leading you through the events and subsequent trials.  Be aware though that the NOOK version of this book does not include any of the photographs, maps etc. that the book version does.  These are important to the story and i was very disappointed to find them not available."
976,"Dr. Seuss's Green Eggs and Ham: For Soprano, Boy Soprano, and Orchestra",0793551617,"Robert Kapilow, Dr. Seuss",Barnes and Noble,5,amandaonfire252 on LibraryThing,This book is an outstanding poetry book for beginners. I found that reading this book to younger children made them more interested and eager to help with the rhyming. This book is about the silly ways that Sam-I-Am is asked to eat green eggs and ham. It is his fear of not liking something because he has never tried it and does not appear to like the color  that makes him refuse in many ways. Finally at the end he tries the food and found out that he did indeed like green eggs and ham and would eat them anywhere.I would use this in my class as a sort of life lesson about trying new things out to see if you like it. I would probably have green the kids try actual green eggs and ham and eat it to see if they like it and maybe write in a journal about it or have a discussion about some other foods they think they don't like and the foods that are their favorites.

978,"Shadow of Night (All Souls Trilogy, #2)",0670023485,Deborah Harkness,Barnes and Noble,4.3,kimba88,"The tale literal picks up right where Discovery of Witches left off. Diana and Matthew find themselves landing back in Elizabethan London. Diana is thrilled to be able to visit a period she has studied but finds herself woefully unprepared. She quickly realizes that even with her education she is completely out of her element. From her speech to her mannerism it is obvious to all; she isn&rsquo;t from around here. With the aid of Matthew&rsquo;s eccentric friends, they will work to assist Diana with these skills, secure a witch to train her and find the lost copy of Asmole 782. The tale that unfolds is absolutely breathtaking, filled with suspense, romance, danger and iconic characters throughout Elizabethan history. The characters are flawed, fleshed out and I absolutely adore them. Diana finds herself out of her element. Her witchcraft is acting all sorts of bonkers. She is living in a time when witches are burned at the stake, the clothes are barbaric and women have no rights. In this novel we get to see tremendous growth in Diana. Her love and understanding of Matthew grows. She becomes more confident in her own skin and continues to be loyal, fearless and stubborn. I loved watching her discover her talents as a witch. This provides both funny and frightening scenes as her inability to control them creates mayhem. Then of course there is Matthew *swoons*. In this novel we learn so much about him and what has molded the modern day version. His history is both fascinating and sad. We get to see a darker side of Matthew as he confronts his past. He loves Diana but things are holding him back. I loved discovering his inner-workings. Diana peeled back his layers, bringing them closer together. The soft, tender side of Matthew was beautiful. There are a few flash forwards to present time and the characters we love. This provides insight into how Matthew and Diana are changing the future. We spend most of the novel in the years 1950 and 1951. This affords us the opportunity to witness history, attend the queen, and meet many historical characters. Harkness did a fantastic job of weaving them in the tale and giving them voice. I adored getting to know Gallowglass and Matthew&rsquo;s father. The Queen and other characters gave me the chills and I feared for Diana. Harkness has an incredible gift for world-building. She brought the Elizabethan era to life. Her interpretation of the queen, the atmosphere, and the smells of London lifted the tale right from the pages and I become completely immersed. It is immediately evident that a tremendous amount of research went into writing this novel. I was delighted by the historical accuracy and believability. From the buildings, merchants and furnishing, Harkness's imagery was enthralling. The characters she introduced were fleshed-out, and my feelings toward them reflected that. Shadow of Night held my attention and kept me up late two evening in a row, but it was worth every sleep-deprived minute. Harkness spun twists and turns into the plot that completely captivating me. We travel all over Europe and I loved all the little details. The fear of discovery and the atmosphere of the times, especially towards witches made this tale very suspenseful. The romance between Diana and Matthew was genuine and beautifully portrayed. Thanks to Viking for providing a finished copy in exchange for my unbiased review"
978,"Shadow of Night (All Souls Trilogy, #2)",0670023485,Deborah Harkness,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"SOME SPOILERS!  

As a university writing professor of 20+ years, a rabid reader, and  history buff, I find Harkness to be one of the more frustrating writers I've encountered. An obviously brilliant historian with  terrific ideas, her books have enough originality and intrigue to hook me--until I'm reduced to screaming frustration by the weak (or absent) editing, inconsistent characters and ""Twilight"" For 
Academia plotlines. I was SO hoping ""Shadow"" would improve upon ""Discovery"", but I don't think it does in any major way. Like ""Discovery,"" ""Shadow"" has the makings of a terrific novel; I can see that novel; I just can't get to it:

1. ""Discovery"" desperately needed to be cut by half; while shorter, ""Shadow""  still needs to be cut in half. After a conscise, fast start, the novel goes  off the rails as it progresses.  HOW many times must we be told Matthew and Diane have no more secrets only to be told, oops, there's more?  How many references to Matthew's stalkerish possessiveness, his astounding beauty, their star-crossed obssession  and her inept magic do we need? WAY too many characters, plotlines, secret organizations, obscure or cliched historical references (Dracula? really?) Must Matthew have some connection with all historical figures (major and minor) of the last 1,500 years? An awful, uneplained death at the end comes out of nowhere  and reads like an overly obvious attempt at ""shocking cliffhanger."" The last 200 pages cram in so much ""stuff"" (Diana's dad?!), I felt like tbe author was trying to use every. single. idea. she had. Edit!!

2. One plus is that the inane,infuriating ""Twilight"" parallels that show up via  plot and character in ""Discovery"" are, somewhat, toned down. Diana has some backbone--mercifully not as much fainting, sleeping, being carried around, and following Matthew's every command--but we're still stuck with the icky half-vampire baby plotline and way too many simpering ""ma couer"" dialogue points.

Worse, common sense alludes these supposed geniuses consisently. After showing some spunk and real intellect, Diane then does incredibly stupid things, repeatedly, like deliberately exposing herself to dangerous creatures, being surprised when they find her and want her dead, while apparently forgetting her past history of torture, abuse and being in the 16th century to HIDE.  

Matthew is TOO much: too Byronic, too James Bond meets Lancelot, yet  not smart enough to realize that yes, if you time travel, you're probably going to alter history and run into people you shouldn't or don't want to: like your dead father and crazed sister.  

 
3. Not consummating the affair was one of ""Discovery's"" most annoying points--it finally happens here but we have to wait almost 200 pages and the circumstances (Matthew's father basically ordering it) are kind of cringe-worthy. However, the sex scenes do have some fun steaminess and eroticism. 

4. The Ashmole search unbelievably disappears for long stretches while the lovers do other things and give the search over to secondary characters who, every 100 pgs or so,pop in to say it's still missing. It only becomes important again almost 3/4 of the way thru.  There are supposedly reasons for this--but I didn't care by the time I got there.

Deborah Harkness has a sexy, fascinating, fun novel in here SOMEWHERE but this isn't it. Sh"
978,"Shadow of Night (All Souls Trilogy, #2)",0670023485,Deborah Harkness,Barnes and Noble,4.3,booksonmynook,I loved this book. very well written. Finished it very quickly
979,Leaving Time,0345544927,Jodi Picoult,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,I am a Jodi Picoult fan and this is definately my favorite so far. I loved the relationships between the people and the elephants. Just when I thought I had the story figured out there would be a new revolation which would again leave me guessing.  This is just a great book!
979,Leaving Time,0345544927,Jodi Picoult,Barnes and Noble,4,Panther18,"Yes, Jodi has obviously done a great deal of research on elephants, but if you think that this is just a &quot;Discovery Channel&quot; episode on 
elephants, WOW! You sure don't know Jodi Picoult very well. Think outside the box a little and read between the lines. By giving us so 
many details about the &quot;humanity&quot; of elephants, she is able to draw many parallels between the mother and daughter characters in her
book. I think her book is thought provoking and beautifully written."
979,Leaving Time,0345544927,Jodi Picoult,Barnes and Noble,4,NonniD,"I had a hard time getting into this book for the first 50 pages or so. I had read the short story ""Where There's Smoke"" so I really wanted to stick with it. Meanwhile I read some of the reviews on BN/Nook and was so bummed and mad at the rude person who added a blatant spoiler in her first few sentences with no warning. Because I love Jodi Picoult so much I kept at it and soon was hooked. I loved every minute after that, even learning so much about elephants, which caused others to think the book was boring. I found that part interesting and I think it's wonderful that Jodi used her status as an author to bring light on the true horrors still happening to elephants every day and all over the world. In the end the spoiler didn't matter and I loved it and still was surprised in spite of what I knew!"
980,"Moon Called (Mercy Thompson, #1)",0441013813,Patricia Briggs,Barnes and Noble,4.5,SirBunch,"Despite being a strong, contemporary,  female lead character Mercy Thompson is not overly feminist. Briggs has created a gutsy, true-to-life type of female protagonist which is rare. Beyond that the book is fun to read, well paced, littered with laughs, and entertaining. I'm going to read the rest of the series for sure."
980,"Moon Called (Mercy Thompson, #1)",0441013813,Patricia Briggs,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Xedra77,"OK, I know, that's a cheesy title for a review, but I hate trying to pick out titles for these things.  That's probably why I'm an avid reader, instead of a writer.  I read about a book a day these days, mostly stuff that makes my husband tease.  There was no hurrying through this book, though.  It was so different from the rest, and totally lacking in anything resembling smut, that it had to be savored slowly.

Mercy is such a real, and totally developed character that I found myself looking at the cover and wondering who that was they had drawn - it certainly wasn't the character the Briggs described.  Being the only one of her kind that she knows of, Mercy is a strong, independent woman despite being raised, and almost constantly surrounded by the pack.  I love the way she handles the men in her life thoroughly and, amazingly, shows them that she can overcome all of the things that they see as her weaknesses.  

I laughed out loud when she walked out of the trailer at the end leaving them both behind.  Serves them right.  I'd explain better, but you really need to read this one for yourself."
980,"Moon Called (Mercy Thompson, #1)",0441013813,Patricia Briggs,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Kasia_S,"I wasn't sure what to expect from Briggs after reading so much praise for her books but it didn't take long to feel as if I passed out and woke up in werewolf heaven. Anyone who knows me, knows that I love werewolf anything so this was such a treat, totally unexpected because urban fantasy these days is such a wide mix, usually with witches and vampires with a wolf here and there, but this beast of a book has teeth, muscle, wit, charm and plenty of brawn. Briggs did an incredible job of floating the reader in a sea of incredibly perceptive werewolf folklore that was simply stunning and extremely interesting and she made it feel primordial and Earthy, the instincts, thrills and even some passion was intelligent and very deep. This book is merely a perception that its fantasy and fun, everything reads so realistically that I had a hard time believing that this world was made up. It was a lot to get through as the plot thickened very quickly, the main heroine had no other choice but to plunge and run wild with the pack and troubles never seemed to stay far behind.Basically this novel is about Mercedes, a seemingly young girl (you never know how old those creatures really are) that can turn into a coyote at will. An echo of Native American folklore runs thorough the tale as she keeps herself busy running a car repair shop, pretending that she's nothing but an ordinary citizen. Never mind that her next door neighbor Adam is an alpha male, that's the big werewolf on campus, running a large pack of fluffy, irksome and very volatile werewolves. There is also Stefan, her vampire friend whose care she's fixing, and if anyone reads these kinds of books seriously, then they know that vampires are so much more devious and complex than the cunning and ultra sensitive weres and they can never get along! It isn't long when the two sides start to merge into Mercy's life when a strange boy shows up at her door, smelling like a wolf. He brings trouble with him and pretty soon something happens and Mercedes has no choice but get closer to the wolves and vampires to try and fight a new enemy, trouble is no one knows who the person is and why they are killing werewolves with strange drugs. When trust and loyalty issues come up between friends and pack members things get ugly as no one ever wants to refuse a fight, and fight they do.I can't even scratch the surface of how freaking awesome this book was, so rich and intricate, totally delectable and gut stirring- a definite hit in my opinion. Now all I have to do is read the rest of the series to quench my thirst, I'm very curious future that unfolds in front of Mercedes and her very cool albeit dangerous friends. Briggs makes the life of a wolf almost beautiful, of course I don't know if I'd want to be one but it would be lovely to turn into one and run like a dog into the sunset once in a while.Happy Halloween `08- Kasia S."
981,"Blue Bloods (Blue Bloods, #1)",0786838922,Melissa de la Cruz,Barnes and Noble,4.2,BANCHEE_READS,"This is a great vampire tale. They are called blue bloods and come into their heritage around the age of 15. These blue bloods are descendants, or in some cases, the same people who came on the Plymouth. The blue bloods are very wealthy and all go to the same school. Several know what they are before receiving their invitation to the Committee but like Schuyler, others have no clue. Life is great, you find out your immortal, nothing can kill you, you are forever perfect, sun doesn't hurt you, but something is hunting and killing blue bloods.
I enjoyed this book, it was good. Not the best vamp book I've ever read, but a page turner. I enjoy Schuyler and Oliver's relationship and Mimi is the perfect rich brat.
I think the reader is lead to believe there is a relationship brewing between Schuyler and Oliver but in the matter of a paragraph it's nothing. Jack is way too hot and cold to Schuyler and doesn't make sense in his intentions. It also seemed in the space of one chapter being 2 pages long, Schuyler has learned the ancient language and the reader is given the impression that she has discovered very strong hidden powers. The book was moving along very nicely and then it just seemed like it was chopped down and rushed to the end.
Also note, you will not find out who the Silver Blood is, this book does leave you hanging with a need to read the next in the series."
981,"Blue Bloods (Blue Bloods, #1)",0786838922,Melissa de la Cruz,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"In this wonderful book, Schuyler, Bliss, Mimi, and Jack (a name you will come to LOVE), deal with finding out things other then their heritage and school work. On top of learning your becoming a vampire, people are mysteriously dying, dealing with your best friend straying from you, dealing with the school populars, and conceling your crush on a ""boy"" you can't have; the silver bloods are far from destroyed. 

ok, so I have to say that I have 2 addictions now; I LOVE the Twilight series and The Blue Bloods Series. I honestly thought that I would NEVER find a book as good as or even something that would be as simi cool as Twilight, but in the past week, I have found that totally untrue! The Blue Blood series is a thrilling, heart-warming, exciting romance/suspense story. You sympathize, you get frusterated with, and even, I dare say, fall in love with some of the characters. It always kept me guessing and predicting as I read...(and that was NON stop becuase I couldn't put it down). I generally don't like reading books with a three person point of view, but this kept me on edge and explained alot about the characters so you could get to really know (and sorta understand) them. I bought all (so far, can't wait until the fourth comes out....)and haven't regretted it. I LOVE these books! The only thing I would warn you is that you might want to wait until the fourth book to read them, because the 3rd one leaves you hanging! :)

(:  Enjoy, Reading 'em!  :)"

982,"The Alienist (Dr. Laszlo Kreizler, #1)",0812976142,Caleb Carr,Barnes and Noble,4.3,JGolomb,"Wow. What a read. I don't think I've gone through 600 pages faster than I did with ""Alienst"" over the past week. The story is exciting. The writing is vivid. And the characters are interesting. 

Think of this as CSI - New York - 1896. The story: a turn of the century psychologist, a crime reporter, Theodore Roosevelt, and a few other detectives and support staff search for a serial killer who's horribly butchering children in New York City.

There are virtually no lulls in the story, as author Carr drops clue after clue, and slowly builds up an empirical profile of the mysterious killer. There are no obvious points to put the book down and take a breather, as I continuously found myself staying up later and later following each new lead and discovery.

The book is a bit gory. There's nothing held back in the details of bloody murders, and reflections on stories of abuse. If you're able to accept this level of realism, then I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book."
982,"The Alienist (Dr. Laszlo Kreizler, #1)",0812976142,Caleb Carr,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Dr_Dean,"I absolutely loved this book!
There is a little bit of everything in this novel--part murder mystery, part psychological thriller, with a generous dose of historical accuracy thrown in.  The reader is thrown into New York City at the turn of the 20th century, where the field of psychology is fighting to emerge into legitimacy.  A rag-tag team is formed to stop a serial killer brutally murdering child prostitutes using rudimentary criminological science.  It's fusion with real characters of the time (Theodore Roosevelt, J.P. Morgan) with an electrifying story made it impossible to put down.  I can't wait to read the sequel!"
982,"The Alienist (Dr. Laszlo Kreizler, #1)",0812976142,Caleb Carr,Barnes and Noble,4.3,AliceB52,"I am typically a very slow reader, but when I get something really great, I go through it too fast.  This is one of those books.  The characters are compelling, but the plot and setting are so unusual.  The historical details are so interesting.  It is hand over fist one of the most intelligent thrillers I have ever read.  I generally love historical thrillers anyway, but this one is top notch.  If you are a fan of the genre and haven't yet read it then this must go to the top of your list!"

984,Paradise Lost,0140424393,"John Milton, John      Leonard",Barnes and Noble,4.9,vibrantminds on LibraryThing,A 17th century epic of the Genesis account with references to classical mythology throughout.  From the beginning formations of the earth to the design of paradise to the creation of Adam and Eve to the Fall. The idea behind the verse is that paradise is lost but hope still remains through Christ who will save the offspring of our first parents who sinned.  Adam is shown a vision when his hope is diminished that encompasses all of humanity from Noah to Abraham to Joseph of Egypt to David and up through Christ¿s birth and death.  The world is corrupt but there is hope for all in the end.  Very difficult but interesting to read; there are notes to help through all the references to the mythology and other passages that we today are unfamiliar with.

Following these eccentric characters and their interactions with the big Wall Street investment banks is at turns laugh out loud funny and head shaking incredulous.  Lewis knows how to turn a phrase and does a good job teasing out the dark humor of the situations.  He also does a very good job at explaining the essence of very complicated financial transactions and gives the reader a good understanding of the whys and hows of the financial meltdown.  While this book is an important addition to our understanding of what happened, it isn't complete as it doesn't spend any time talking about US government policies that contributed to the crash (specifically, the special legal status given to the three rating agencies, and Fannie and Freddie's role in weakening underwriting standards).  Nonetheless, this is still both an important and entertaining book."
985,The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine,0393072231,Michael   Lewis,Barnes and Noble,4.1,TheReadingWriter,"It seems ridiculous for me to urge you to read this book. Don't read it. You'll sleep better. But please don't go investing on Wall Street if you don't read it. This book took my breath away. I learned things and feel oddly vindicated and cheated at the same time. I knew dumb people were making money with my money: vindicated. I thought some people in the government might be smart enough to realize what happened and know what to do: cheated. Michael Lewis did the plebian job of untangling a very messy ball of knotted threads and on the other hand did a herculean job of elevating the discussion above the rock-slinging and shouting to which some angry losers are wont to resort. His characterizations of those involved on both sides of the trades are intimate enough to involve our emotions as well as our interest, but I think what really charmed me was the absurdity of some phrases that matched so perfectly the absurdities he was describing: 'Inside Morgan Stanley, the subprime lending boom created a who-put-chocolate-in-my-peanut-butter moment.' (p.201) Osama and his team of bombers couldn't have done what our own Wall Street firms and their rating agencies and regulators did to the to the U.S. people and to the credibility of the U.S. government: 'It was as if bombs of differing sizes had been placed in virtually every major financial institution. The fuses had been lit and could not be extinguished. All that remained was to observe the speed of the spark, and the size of the explosions.' (p.225)"
985,The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine,0393072231,Michael   Lewis,Barnes and Noble,4.1,ELKMA,"Michael Lewis does a terrific job of explaining the esoteric world of sub prime mortgages, collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps and provides a very accessible understanding of the near melt down of the financial system.  The book is also highly entertaining with a cast of characters that will play well in the movie version."
986,The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon,1416524290,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Jessica96,"The Girl who Loved Tom Gordon
By Stephen King
	
	This is a very suspenseful novel.  It is written with great detail, and is very well thought out.  It is about a nine year old girl named Trisha McFarland, who disappears off of a trail with her mother and brother in the Appalachian Mountains.  Her family always argues with each other and pays little attention to her. She thinks of herself as the invisible child.  While they are spending their time bickering with each other, Trisha tells them that she needs to use the restroom and is going to take the other path, and catch up to them when she is done.  They do not hear her of course. She goes too far into the over grown path and looses her way.  
	Trisha loves sports and she idolizes Tom Gordon, a famous Red Socks player.  He is her hero, because listening to the baseball games on her walkman, while being lost in the woods gives her hope for survival.  A search party goes out looking for Trisha, and she knows because she had heard it on the news station of the walkman.  A helicopter flies over her, but does not see her, and she is left alone in the woods.
	Trisha has to find out how to survive on her own, with the little supplies she has in her backpack.  She eats all of her food and drinks all that she has, and the water form a stream that she has walked miles to makes her sick.  She makes her way into a crescent shaped clearing, and gets the feeling that she is not alone.  
	She later finds out that ""the thing in the woods"" has been following her the entire time.  It is a spirit and a misshaped monster that has stopped her from eating by placing dead animals by all food sources, and clawed and knocked down trees.  It looks like a human with no eyes, and wasps covering every inch of it, and completely terrifies her. Trisha tries to convince her self it was a dream.  But it is not.  Overall, I would say that it is an exciting book, with a great plot. Also, the characters and setting make the story come to life and feel as if you are part of it."

Don't get me wrong the book is very well written and it has it moments, but they a far and few in between.

I was a little surprised after finishing it and realized it had really touched me in a very real way. Mind you, I am in my forties and like young adult novels because they are easy reads.

So many thing WOT fans have been waiting for happened in this book, and every one lived up to my expectations. I really enjoyed reading it. I found Mat to be much more like himself in this book than in the last one, though I admit there were a few moments he was a little off. But even those bits, I still loved. About the ebook - Yes, it was delayed at the request of the author's estate. Harrit, Robert Jordan's wife and editor, explained at a book signing that they delayed it because unfortunately, ebooks sales do not count towards sales in the New York Times Bestsellers list. Every other book in the series has always made it onto the list, which is notonly prestigious but gains the series more readers. So as disappointing as it is, I think that is an acceptable reason to delay it. So yes, please don't complain to B&N, Amazon, Tor/Macmillan, or Brandon Sanderson, because they have nothing to do with it and cannot do anything about it. In fact, originally, the ebook was going to be delayed by a year, but Brandon Sanderson persuaded Harriet to delay the release by only three months. And I agree, please don't give the book a low rating because you're disappointed about the ebook. People look at those ratings to determine if the book is worth a read, and this one definitely is."

989,The Day of the Jackal,0553266306,Frederick Forsyth,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Janus,"If you have seen and enjoyed the old movie ""The Day of the Jackal"" then this book is essential to your library. While it is true that you will know basically what happens, the book flushes out the characters and procedures so much more than the movie had time to. There is a growing demographic of readers whom devour assassin-themed books, this book is kind of like the granddaddy for that genre. Pros: Fascinating, well-written, exciting and plain old fun. Cons: Assumes the reader knows some rather obscure information, slow starting and very long chapters. Overall: A must for fans of thrillers and assassin fiction alike. Rates up there with works by Trevanian and Ludlum."
989,The Day of the Jackal,0553266306,Frederick Forsyth,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"I'll agree with the other opinions here that it's a good story. But I almost didn't get to the good parts because it took sooo long to get going. If you're not familiar with French history, and don't know much about French in general (like how to pronounce it), all of the tedious backstory and names and places and events you get hit with in the beginning can really get in the way. For a lot of the first section 'Anatomy of a Plot' I was wondering if we would EVER get to the part that actually invovled the Jackal. Once it finally does get rolling though, it rolls along very well. And the twist at the end is definitely worth a good chuckle."

The advice is practical and the writing style is clear and concise. You may not be able to completely remodel your business to adapt to their suggestions, but there are plenty of ""Ah hah!"" moments. The book is bursting with examples on how to save time, raise morale, and keep your business healthy. While some ideas seem unconventional like ""fire the workaholics"", throwing out resumes, and under-doing the competition, as you read the explanations you can clearly see the value of their unique approaches to common problems businesses face. The book is a quick read and full of useful suggestions."

More than that they offer practices and ways to think about things related to making a living in software and succeed.  However, it is NOT ABOUT BEING B-I-G.  It is about being able to make a good living and get on with your life.

More than that, things they discuss in the book I have even seen doing a little micro business.  Where the micro business does some parts right it matches the book's dos.  Then there are some things done wrong, and they match the book's don'ts.

Perhaps something I love most is their harsh criticism of false heroics and a$$ in seat culture where we all ""work"" overtime.  Yeah, there are times you do some real OT 'cause you are hot on the trail.  However if you are always driving at 80%+ you won't have slack needed when disaster hits.  They take on these hero myths and tear then down for the junk they are.

If you are a modern, well read developer who has a dream of being their own boss some day,  or just finding a way to wage some healthy culture war against stupidity at your current job... read this book.  It will fire you up."

993,Tell the Wolves I'm Home,0679644199,Carol Rifka Brunt,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"Tell the Wolves I'm Home is about love and how it is seldom easy or tidy; often hard to define, keep, and give; but how necessary it is, what it can make of our lives.  The novel is narrated by a perfectly written and vividly realized 14-year-old June, who was in love with her gay uncle, Finn, a famous artist, who dies of AIDS shortly after the novel begins.  (The novel is set in the late 1980s, a time when AIDS was a new and misunderstood disease, and thus a very frightening one as well.  The novel captures the memory of that time totally, and beautifully.)  June has a sister, Greta, who is slowly imploding, jealous of June's relationship with Finn which she blames for changing what she had with June.  June and Greta's mother, Finn's sister, blames Finn's boyfriend Toby for Finn's death and what she sees as Finn's earlier abandonment.  Toby misses Finn as much as June does, and it is the bond between these two, grieving the loss of the same love, that delivers June and Greta back to each other, and heals their mother.  Near the book's end, June says,""I know all about love that's too big to stay in a tiny bucket.  Splashing out all over the place in the most embarrassing way possible.""  She does, and watching her come into this knowledge is fabulous and satisfying reading."
993,Tell the Wolves I'm Home,0679644199,Carol Rifka Brunt,Barnes and Noble,4.5,P_K_McAlister,"Sometimes an author writes about a person's life that has resulted in some kind of tragedy and as you turn the pages the story becomes less and less believable. That is NOT the case with Tell the Wolves I&rsquo;m Home. The author tells a story during the period of a person&rsquo;s particular tragedy along with her immediate family and writes about life correctly. This book could have happened to anyone&rsquo;s family. This is a well written, thought out book."
993,Tell the Wolves I'm Home,0679644199,Carol Rifka Brunt,Barnes and Noble,4.5,KimballSK,"What a touching and lovely story. Tell the Wolves I'm Home had me alternating between hope and despair, laughter and tears and generally a looking like a hot mess to anyone not reading over my shoulder or reading my mind. 

This story of a young girl losing her beloved uncle takes place in a time (not so long ago) when a homosexual lifestyle was marginally accepted, but still kept under wraps for propriety's sake. In other words: we accept your choice, but let's not discuss it in front of the children because we still secretly think you're a perv no matter what we tell you to the contrary. 

And if you were unlucky enough to catch the ""Gays Disease,"" you were barely able to be around children, much less let them know the nature of your disease. I grew up in this time and I remember it vividly. It is amazing to me how far we have come in terms of acceptance of alternate lifestyles, as well as how far we still have to go. 

Through a series of misunderstandings and conscious lies, June is kept from fully knowing her precious uncle. So, after his death, when his friend tries to for a relationship with her, she is leery. Through patience and love Toby slowly creates a tenuous friendship with June that helps them both heal from the pain of their mutual loss.

Brunt has created a timeless tale that speaks with an honest voice about loss, family, love, fear, hope and friendship. Tell the Wolves I'm Home truly touched my heart in a profoundly beautiful way."

So excuse me while I ramble for a second... this book was AMAZING. Just amazing. It's hot, twisted, funny, crazy, awesome, amazing... did I mention amazing? Easily my favorite read of the year so far. EASILY.

This book starts off with Mara Dyer and an accident. An accident that killed her friends and left her the only survivor. She awakes in the hospital with no memory of what happened. After convincing her family to move away from the memories Mara's world starts to turn upside down. She has no idea what is going on with her, but with the help of Mr. Noah (SEXY) Shaw things may be beginning to make sense... or are they?

Honestly, you think you know what is going on, you think you know what is happening but up until that last page... every theory is thrown from your brain (so make sure you're wearing your seat belt)! I can't give a review like I normally would because I know it would be entirely to easy to spoil something. This book was twisted in the best possible way. I tore through the pages. Noah Shaw is just the sexiest boy ever. His every move, every word (English btw!), his touch, his swag, his hair, his necklace, the way his eyes devour Mara... I. Just. Can't. Get. Enough. Of. Him! The images in this book are also so vivid and I want to know more... so much more! I want to know about Mara. I want to know about Noah. I want to know about.... you really didn't think I was going to tell you, did you? ;)

Seriously, buy this book... no buy FOUR, because I promise you, you will love it. I want Book2 SO MUCH words can't even describe how much I want book2. I need to know what the HECK happened at the end of the book... my jaw seriously dropped to the floor. It all made sense but... HOW. HOW. Just wow. I'm in love with this book. I will being buying more than one when it comes out. One to keep and hold and snuggle with. One to give away so I can share the MARA DYER love, and the others i'm sure i'll hang them around my room or something. ;) I cannot rave enough about this book, so I'm going to cut myself off, but before I do... Mad kudos to you Michelle. I loved the concept, the story, the romance, the family, the friends, and the cover is just so gosh darn beautiful. A million stars out of five. :)

PS. I want Mara to wear yellow in the next book. Just for fun ;) HAHAHA."
995,"The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer (Mara Dyer, #1)",0000000000,Michelle Hodkin,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Nikkayme,"The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer is inventive, pervasive, and completely mind-boggling. Each and every answer leads to more questions and to more mystery. Michelle Hodkin's storytelling is spot-on, with pitch-perfect flow and unbelievable revelations. I was glued to the page, frantic for more information, but dwelling on each scene at the same time.

Mara is one of the most perfect characters because she is funny and flippant, but a good person at her core. She has a very messed up past and unraveling it with her is like digging for treasure, revealing another piece of the puzzle one excruciatingly minute after another. Mara's relationship with her family grounds her though and keeps her sane. It also makes her feel that much more realistic to the reader. Some of my favorite scenes involve her and her two brothers.

And all the scenes with Noah are fantastic. Their banter may be petty, but I couldn't help but want more because sexy British boy is sexy. He's also got quite the alluring mystery to him. We already know Mara is swathed in confusion, but Noah has a few skeletons in his closet as well and I enjoyed digging them out. Also, there is hotness and it is swoony and I want my own Noah.

On top of everything are Mara's nightmares and hallucinations, which create a dark tone that lingers even throughout the lighter scenes - side note: Jamie, Mara's first (and only, really) friend at school is freaking awesome. Loved him! - Something big is going on and finding out involves death, creepiness, and a lot of strange things.

The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer is, by far, one of the most crazy awesome, what just happened-filled, mystery-laden books I've ever read. Everything about it pulls the reader in and refuses to let go. Michelle Hodkin's writing is enthralling and tantalizingly good. The mystery and intrigue are done in a way that the very first chapter will have you hooked and by then, you're a goner. You'll have to sit and read. And read and read and read; until you reach the end and just stare at the page in awe. That's what this book will do to you."
995,"The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer (Mara Dyer, #1)",0000000000,Michelle Hodkin,Barnes and Noble,4.6,VysBlog,"My first thoughts after The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer: *Speechless* and then after being speechless I became very paranoid. Like scared to look in the mirror after you take a shower paranoid. This was crazy twisted and beautiful. No one told me how creepy this was going to be. When I wasn't sitting around looking under my bed I was sitting trying to understand what just happened. One page I think I know what's going on and then the next it's like I haven't even read the pages at all. I didn't feel like I was READING the story of Mara, I felt like I was LIVING the life with Mara. This isn't the typical everyday normal life, but Michelle Hodkin wrote it in a way that I believed that this was normal. As normal as the writing made it, Mara's life is anything but normal. Mara is a bit on edge when she finds that she doesn't remember what happened the night when her friends were killed. She doesn't remember why she was the only one who survived. Mara lives in fear of everything she sees and hears. Day after day with the fear of herself and what she might do. You'd think that after being traumatized by an event like that the last thing Mara would do is fall in love. When Mara does something, it's never something ordinary, not even when she falls in love. Mara ends up falling for the school's most gorgeous guy, Noah Shaw. He got to me the second he spoke with his English/British accent. *swoons* Noah started off as a real jerk and a total player, and I'm using that loosely. He's arrogant, slick, and dark. Of course underneath there's a whole different guy who I don't even know. I loved everything about this book. From the original plot to the characters developments, especially the characters themselves. I just ate this book up the second I got it. I understand that there is a lot of hype going on for Mara Dyer and some may be wary of reading it. In my opinion, this book was as amazing. I do see where the opinions are kind of weighted to either you absolutely love the book like crazy or absolutely find nothing about you like. But give it a shot because The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer has to be one of my favorite books I've read this year."

I first started it, I thought it would have the usual classic novel stereotypes: hard to understand English and a plot that seems boring (to teens anyways..). I was definitely wrong! To me, this was one of those can't-put-down-until-I-finish books.

1000,"Shadow and Bone (Shadow and Bone, #1)",0805094598,Leigh Bardugo,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"Fantasy fans will love this young adult novel. It is well written and thoroughly enjoyable. More of an epic fantasy than a light fantasy. It draws from Russian folklore and features a strong female lead. There is some romance, but the main focus is on the lead learning she has power and then learning how to wield it. My only complaint is that I wish it had been longer. I was really into the setting and the characters. I chose this book because of my fondness for the Game of Thrones series by George R.R. Martin. I wasn't disappointed and can't wait to read the sequel to Shadow and Bone."
1000,"Shadow and Bone (Shadow and Bone, #1)",0805094598,Leigh Bardugo,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Cupcakegirly,"Excuse me while I FANGIRL all over this book!

The last couple of books I've read, have been such downers for me that I've either been unable to finish them or tempted to throw in the reading towel altogether. That is until this book... I'd seen the reviews, heard the hype and had it recommended to me by numerous people but honestly, when I got it and realized there was a map in the front, I was in no hurry to bump it up in my TBR pile. What's the big deal about a map? They just scare me. Always have. Old ones, new ones, doesn't matter. I see a map and a part of my brain panics. (Irrational, stupid, silly...I know.) Maps don't deter me from reading books but they do delay me sometimes which is what happened with Shadow and Bone and I am kicking myself for it.

This is a fantastic debut! Bardugo has created a colorful world filled with fantasy, adventure, and a heart-clutching love story. Her world building is detailed, her characters complex and engaging and the story itself sucked me in immediately. I couldn't and didn't WANT to put this book down!

Alina is a strong willed MC, whose courageous, with a good heart and a witty sense of humor. Mal, is a mix of comfort, strength and swoon (OhMyMal!) and the Darkling, a character that's equal parts beauty and danger, is one you can't help but feel drawn to. There is SO MUCH I want to say about this book *flails* and I don't want to spoil anything, but the plot twists and turns kept me guessing right up to the very end and left me craving the next book."
1000,"Shadow and Bone (Shadow and Bone, #1)",0805094598,Leigh Bardugo,Barnes and Noble,4.5,TiareSho,"After much consideration I've decided that I will give the book 5 stars after all, though there was some time in the middle there where I was worried about it. I, momentarily, feared that it included the one thing that can bring an otherwise good book down; insta-love. Luckily that matter was resolved, and I was able to go on enjoying the book. 

What I liked:
- World building. To me, world building is one of the most important parts of a book. If I don't understand the setting, or if the author makes me effort to create a good fantasy world, then the book loses an entire layer of enjoyment, but this book had great world building. I think that including the map in the front of the book, as well as the explanation of the order of the Grisha, was a really good thing to do. I ended up flipping back to there a few times as I was reading, and it made the world building make a lot more sense.

- She made me feel for both sides of the love triangle. As far as love triangles go, this one was good. The author got me on board with one side, and then managed to make me switch. Usually I get stuck on one side, and then no matter what the author does I just can't seem to see the light on the other side, but she made me feel for the Darkling, and the made me feel for Mal.

- The Darkling. At first I really really liked him, and I wanted him to be with Alina. And then I really hated him, but in that way that good villains have, where you hate him so much that you like him. Kind of like Loki in The Avengers. He's the villain, but I can't really hate him.

What I didn't like:
- I could have done without the insta-love scare. Alina and the Darkling was my ship, but when he kissed her I really couldn't get on board with it. It was so sudden, and weird. However, this issue was resolved so this isn't really much of a negative.


I'm definitely looking forward to the next book in the series! When does it come out? June? That's too far away!"
1001,The Dinner,0770437850,"Herman Koch, Sam Garrett",Barnes and Noble,3.2,Fester,"I found this book to be a compelling page-turner, beautifully written.  I found it interesting that nearly all of the characters were horrible, self-serving, and unlikable - most stories feature a &quot;good guy&quot; or hero to serve as foil to the villan.  I think this is the best book I have read in a long time, much better even than the highly accaimed &quot;Gone Girl&quot;  which is currently on the best-seller list."
1001,The Dinner,0770437850,"Herman Koch, Sam Garrett",Barnes and Noble,3.2,Anonymous,"This book was horrible, but I couldn't put it down. I felt like I was waiting for more to happen, but the writer &quot;hid&quot; everything that would have made this book more interesting. In the end, I felt like reading this book was a complete waste of time. There was so much potential too, but everything felt under developed. There were too many &quot;fillers&quot; with the overly done descriptions of Paul's surroundings, to the point where it started to get annoying.  I wouldn't recommend this book, but you don't have to take my word for it."
1001,The Dinner,0770437850,"Herman Koch, Sam Garrett",Barnes and Noble,3.2,kalevala,"The characters appear  normal and end up, without giving away the ending, totally bizarre and dysfunctional.
The narrator/father Paul initially appears as a common, well-adjusted middle class parent.  would love to ask the author if he  intentionally presented  Paur as unfeeling, cruel, cold, violent facist who feels  some persons do not deserve to live because they are weak, poor, a burden to society. Paul himself is diagnosed as mentally ill.  Was he commenting on contemporary society? 
There is just a lot going on  including family ties, genetics, societial values.  I didn't see it as just a book about families and protecting children. 
I read this book in several days and didn't want to put it down. 
A very enjoyable, edgy book. The dinner setting  for most of the book was interesting."
1002,"Champion (Legend, #3)",0399256776,Marie Lu,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Anonymous,"Its always hard when a good series comes to its end, but harder still when the ending is not what we had in mind. Ive read plenty of stories where the end is too sappy or even too tragic, meaning it leaves you feeling like the story is unresolved. I was a little skeptical about champion because of the ending for allegiant, wondering if all good series where to end so despairingly. Finally though an author has come through!  All through this book i felt that one of the main characters were going to die, marie lu made sure my heart stoped about fifteen times. Thankfully that didnt happen but still Day and June did lose something and that did contribute to that bittersweet ending. All in all you dont get what you want as an ending, but you do get an ending worthy of this series. Fantastic job Marie Lu, hopefully Veroinca Roth can takes some pointers."
1002,"Champion (Legend, #3)",0399256776,Marie Lu,Barnes and Noble,4.7,sdnatasha,"I do love it when a good story comes along and tosses you around a bit, making you feel all sorts of emotions, and then leaves you feeling changed, maybe a little beaten and bruised, but stronger for it, too. 

The book is still told from the points-of-view of both Day and Jane, which has been consistent with the series, which I did like. After reading so many series', it's nice to find cohesion and continuance all the way up to the final book, which some authors don't grant us. Marie does that here, though, and I appreciate that. 

That's also with the characters. Sometimes you see that characters might change from one book to the next without much explanation. Day and June are still Day and June. They still have the traits and fierceness and vulnerability that they've had in the beginning, and the side characters do as well. There might be the slight lack of change-of-heart for some characters that you may want to change, but the reasons for that are simple enough - people don't change their way of thinking as quickly in real life. 

The introduction of some new characters and areas are not too expansive to where you feel lost. The focus is still maintained on the characters that we know and love as well as the situations that we're familiar with already. That's not saying there isn't growth in the world that Marie has created, because there certainly is, but she just doesn't overwhelm, or basically tease, you with what else is going outside of June and Day's perspective. She gives you enough glimpses of life outside of the Rebuplic and the Colonies to make it interesting for you, but still manages to contain the world enough to where you don't get confused. 

The war and the politics and how this future is really makes sense to me. There's a lot of devices and things in there that we are familiar with and I can see how the future that Marie has created can be conceived from the politics and the technology and military of today's culture. What I like the most about this part is that there is not really one area or city or territory that is vastly superior to the others, although a case could be made about one certain territory in particular, but still, I'm sure there are flaws there as well. That might be one thing that the young adults could really learn from this book as far as countries go. Neither the Republic nor the Colonies are favored in the way the people are being treated in either society, and there's much to learn about that that could be seen in today's society. 

Day and June. Oh, my dear Day and my dear June. There was nothing that they said or did that strayed away from what we already knew of them. They both harbor very strong feelings for each other. They both harbor strong doubts about the other and they both are challenged with the thought of whether they can even be together if they really wanted to. There was the established consequences of their past actions towards each other and their families, so of course, there's always that &quot;elephant in the room&quot; for these two. How Marie deals with that in this book is pretty amazing - both heartbreaking and hopeful at the same time. 

I ended the book with tears in my eyes, from both sorrow and joy. Sorrow for what was lost, and joy for what was to come. I found hope again, too. It was earned in one of the most sacrificial ways possible. Deservedly so, I think. So, yes, I can see hope for a future that would fill in those losses with love and fulfillment."
1002,"Champion (Legend, #3)",0399256776,Marie Lu,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Anonymous,"Probably the most emotional of the series for me. That ending... man, that ending. Very well-written cap on the series. I'll be thinking about this one for days."

I was hooked...this was something I couldn't put down for quite some time. I absolutely was enthralled by Sagan's balance of love, astronomy, religion, and everything else imaginable. I was fascinated by Ellie Arroway, the main character and heroine. She was absolutely brilliant, courageous, and everything else an admirable astronomer should be. She held her head high in the face of opposition and broke through all obstacles facing her way. I cried, laughed, applauded, screamed, thought long and hard about universal possibilities, religous questions, and wanted more and more with the turn of each page. I appreciate this book almost more than any other I've read."

While it may give a lot of scientific detail, Sagan portays the work with great style and tact.  His story centers around a scientificly spun story with true moral and intellectual implications that delve into the heart of the human soul.  In the book issues such as the roles of politics in science, religion, love, humanity, etc. are discussed and opened up to the reader.  If you have to read a book for the summer, or a break, this should be it."

1004,"Lola and the Boy Next Door (Anna and the French Kiss, #2)",0525423281,Stephanie Perkins,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Nikkayme,"Lola, oh Lola, you astound me with your ability to turn me into a puddle of emotion. Lola and the Boy Next Door is the most perfectly executed and excruciatingly anticipatory love story I've ever read. Lola Nolan is - as I've dubbed her - badass chic. She loves to wear a frilly dress, but rocks it with combat boots. She dresses in costumes, not to disguise anything, but to be herself. And boy is Lola one hot mess of a girl. She has a sexy, rocker boyfriend named Max, but a strange and torrid history with her old neighbors, the Bell twins, who just happen to move back in next door. Unwanted feelings, 'traumatic' memories, and the best romantic tension ensue. 

Lola is one of those characters that are impossible not to love. Everything about her made me love her more. Her outfits, wigs, the way she thinks out loud - literally, she says it all out loud without realizing it - and the way she loves so completely. Her parents mean the world to her and she's not afraid to show it. Both of her dads are the kind of parents that YA is severely lacking and I loved their involvement in Lola's life. In fact, every single character is fleshed out and has purpose in the story.

Andy and Nathan - Lola's dads - a pie bakery owner (via the kitchen) and a lawyer, respectively, are like any other dads. They enforce called check-ins when Lola is out, make the 22 year old Max come over for Sunday brunch, and freak when boys are in Lola's room. Norah, Lola's birth mom, even plays a role, by forcing Lola to open her eyes to things she maybe isn't willing to see. Lola's best friend Lindsey is not nearly as sparkly and colorful as Lola, but she's her best friend and is there for her whenever she needs her. Anna and Etienne St. Clair make an appearance or two as well, so if you loved Anna and the French Kiss, be prepared for some more fun from them. 

Then there are the Bell twins. Calliope comes off as very cold-shoulderish, but her years of being cut off from normal teen life as a world-class figure skater plays into that a great deal. Getting to know her and  seeing her reasoning softens her a bit though. Now for Cricket. Yes, Cricket. Oh how I did not want to like him. Lola has a boyfriend and he's sexy and a budding rock star, who suffers through double dad interrogation, and I really liked him. But then I LOVED Cricket. 

How do you love a boy named Cricket? Read Lola and try not to. It's impossible, what with his tight pants, enthusiastic nature, and constant smiles. He's insecure, but somehow confident; a little geeky, but completely sexy at the same time; intense and funny and intelligent and selfless. He has this pureness and innocence about him that makes him perfect. But he's perfect because he's imperfect. His flaws - like Lola's flaws - make him a great character.

The romance in Lola and the Boy Next Door is absolutely, stunningly, delectable. Never before have I read something that creates so much tension and anticipation and that 'pleasepleaseplease kiss' sensation so well. That's what Lola will do to you. You'll fall in love with these characters, with their lives, and their hopes and dreams. I know I did. 

Stephanie Perkins has more than done it again with Lola. She has outdone herself, improved upon her previous writing, and given us a story that will resonate with every single person who reads it."
1004,"Lola and the Boy Next Door (Anna and the French Kiss, #2)",0525423281,Stephanie Perkins,Barnes and Noble,4.5,pagese,"I loved Anna and the French Kiss, so I really had high hopes for this one.  I was keeping my fingers crossed that Stephanie's sophomore book would deliver.  I'm happy to say it did!

At first, I wasn't sure what to think of Lola.  She's so different from any other character I've read, and such a drastic change from Anna.  I also didn't identify with her as much.  I don't have that artistic flair and tend to prefer to go with the flow not stand out in the crowd.  But, slowly that characteristic really began to grow on me.  She's everything I'm not, and I really admired that about her.  I also admired the fact that she's a typical teen.  With things begin to snowball, she questions who she really is.  But, she soon realized that being who you are doesn't always mean fitting to everyone else's standards.   A nice change of pace is that Lola is being raised by her two dads, who are really her biological uncle and his partner.  Her mother occasionally comes in and reeks havoc in her life.  

I liked Cricket from the first time we meet him.  I love how it seems like he just appears were ever Lola is.  Some of it is coincidental, but other times you can tell he's making a valiant effort to reconnect with Lola.  I enjoyed his personality.  He's like a combination of nerdy mixed with a couple other ""types"", it's no wonder that Lola is so attracted to him.  I found ironic that Lola never flat out told him that she had a boyfriend.  It's not something I really faulted her on, because I could tell she was really struggling with her feeling concerning Cricket. 


It's funny how a book can twist around how you feel about things.  I was prepared to dislike Calliope (Cricket's sister) and I did for part of the book.  But, she really comes through in the end.  I admired how the how family has backed her in her dreams.  I think the fact that Cricket has put some much of his life on hold for her shows a sense of who he is and what's important to him.  I also really liked Max at first, despite their age difference.  In the end, I couldn't believe that he acted that way he did to Lola.  But, maybe he was really hurt by her actions and this was his only way of expressing it.

In the end, I decided that Lola was just as fantastic as Anna, but in an entirely different way.  I'm amazed that Stephanie has managed to write two completely different heroines and their romances.  I can't wait to read her next one!"
1004,"Lola and the Boy Next Door (Anna and the French Kiss, #2)",0525423281,Stephanie Perkins,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"Coming from Anna and the French Kiss, i expected a great book. The beginning is slow and horrible. The first 60-70 pages are filled with introductions. I understand introducing the plot, characters and etc is important, but it does not need to take up that many pages. However, once you get past the introductions, this book turns out to be great, and similar to Anna anf the French Kiss in the sense of a great teenage romance novel. Please disregard the horrible beginning and you will find it to be an amazing romance novel."
1005,White Teeth,0375703861,Zadie Smith,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Guest,"3 1/2 stars, really. Without a doubt, this is an   ambitious and successful debut by a talented   writer. Smith's voice is distinct and engaging, as   well as funny in that sly British way (no American   guffawing here). However, I was not 100% in love   with 'White Teeth.' I'm not sure why, although it   may have something to do with the fact that I   invested so much time and energy to the   characters (their lives, histories, relationships)   only to have the ending kind of dribble to a close.   Still, it was an enjoyable read¿¿I'm not sorry I read   it and I would recommend it to others. Just be   aware that depending on your tastes, it may not   quite live up to all the glowing reviews."
1005,White Teeth,0375703861,Zadie Smith,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Guest,I really liked Zadie Smith's writing style in that her descriptions were fantastic.  The only thing this book was missing was a plot which is fairly important in my opinion.  There were too many lulls to make me excited to pick it up to read.
1005,White Teeth,0375703861,Zadie Smith,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Guest,"Zadie Smith¿s writing style is without a doubt enjoyable.  I laughed out loud.  However, my opinion agrees with at least one other review listed here, and I quote the other reviewer because she says it perfectly, ¿if an author chooses to make certain cultures so significant/central to her work, she should at least try to present them accurately.¿  Her references to multiple cultures and religions are founded on shallow research if any at all.  My advice to Smith would be to do the research by going to the source next time.  Reference is made to stereotypical beliefs instead of actual truths about certain groups of people.  Unfortunate for Zadie Smith, this would leave the millions of readers with those backgrounds or beliefs feeling misunderstood and misrepresented.  If you are unfamiliar with the cultures and religions represented in this book you will certainly enjoy it.  If you are Jamaican or if you have a background with or you are one of Jehovah¿s Witnesses you will find gaping wholes in some of the characters presented."
1006,American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History,0062107062,"Chris Kyle, Scott McEwen, Jim DeFelice",Barnes and Noble,4.3,vacshop,"If you enjoyed Marcus Luttrell's 'Lone Survivor' you must read this book. Chris Kyle reminds us of just how much American fighters can accomplish with the right amount of training, hard work, attitude and appreciation of the freedoms that we all used to hold dear. 
     Does his super-sized ego show? Can you feel his frustration at the higher-ups, lawyers and politicians in charge? Does he feel like he could have accomplished even more under better leadership? Yes, yes and Yes. In my opinion, Chris and his fellow SEALs have earned the right to these opinions. I've always thought that there's nothing wrong with a little arrogance, as long as you have the talent and accomplishments to back it up. To paraphrase one of my favorite presidents: ""Most of us go to bed at night and wonder what we accomplished all day, SEALs don't have that problem.""
     From cover to cover, this book will always rank at the top of my list of best non-fiction books. 
    I, too am amazed at the review by Snail59. As a 57 year old, 12 year US Navy veteran, I have never in my life heard anything but praise from any sailor, airman, or marine as far as the SEALs are concerned. I just can't grasp where you are coming from.

1006,American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History,0062107062,"Chris Kyle, Scott McEwen, Jim DeFelice",Barnes and Noble,4.3,CameliaMironSkiba,"The other night, watching the show &lsquo;Stars Earn Stripes&rsquo;, my son recognized Chris Kyle, the author of &ldquo;The American Sniper&rdquo;, a biography he read for a school assignment. Curious about it, I picked up the book and browsed through it. Needless to say, I finished it in 1 and 1/2 days.

I come from a country where patriotism used to be forced down our throat on a daily basis, a continuous lie the communists told us for generations. The result of it? We all hated it. 
After moving to the US I always wondered what drives Americans to stand when the national anthem is played before each game. What unseen force tells them to fly their flag, high on a mast, for the world to see it, for the wind to dance with it. What drives them to enroll in the military, leaving all they love and their family and make the ultimate sacrifice. 
Chris Kyle&rsquo;s autobiography answers to all these questions and more. As Chris explains it, it's God, country and family. It's being selfless and the need to protect all that you inherit from your forefathers, believe in, all that you have, and all that you are.
American Sniper is Chris Kyle&rsquo;s account on the Iraq war where he&rsquo;s deployed 4 times. To most people one time is more than enough. You serve your country, do your duty the best you can and then return home. But not for Chris. He needed to be there among his fellow countrymen, covering them, taking fire for them and protecting them with his life if it meant that was the last thing he'd do. 
What media presented (and I should say manipulated) about the war in Iraq is by far different than Chris&rsquo; view on it. We American's didn't go there to, as Chris says, &ldquo;bring democracy to Iraq&rdquo;. We went there to protect fellow countrymen, fight for our country not Iraq. It's a war that politicians deemed necessary, not our soldiers. They only followed orders. 
As a kid Chris had always dreamt to join the military. A dream he'd fulfilled, lived and finally shared memories of it by writing this biography. It's written from Chris&rsquo; point of view, concise and detailed, a progressive narration of war seen through a soldier's eyes. From time to time his wife Taya pitched in, giving us an insight of what a family goes through while their loved ones is at war, the constant fear, the anguish, the frustrations. The biography tells untold stories of unknown heroes. It doesn't sugarcoat, doesn't use fancy words and artistic scenes. There's nothing artistic about the war. 
Like you and I doing our job, that&rsquo;s what Chris did: his job. People might or might not agree with his cold-blooded attitude toward the people he killed. But before you throw that stone let me ask you something: if you disagree with Chris why didn't you stand to protect this country?
God Bless America!"

Each is a collection of random stories over the course of her lifetime, so there's no particular order that readers have to follow to get terrific enjoyment from Chelsea's miseries.

It has a lot of action and furthers the back story of the group from Lorien.  It also introduces us to more of the group and their powers.  It is a good read and leaves you wanting the next in the series to learn how it ends.
1009,The Interestings,1594488398,Meg Wolitzer,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Atthebeach,"The first section of the book outlines six teenagers who meet at a summer camp for the arts. We get to know them and how they become close friends and begin life-long relationships with each other. This portion of the book goes slowly as a long set-up to what comes later. Everything starts to change with a serious, possibly criminal, incident created by one, but affecting all, as they begin adulthood and their relationships become more complex. And love, marriage, careers, failures, successes, etc., continue to develop the relationships of these six. And, of course, not all ends well. The story is interesting, the characters mostly well-developed, the plot moves along without suspense or speed. I will say that some of the story suggests soul-searching and looking back at how our own relationships develop and transition, how much friendship plays roles in our lives. It was good reading, but didn't fit my normal preference for more plot and a faster pace."
1009,The Interestings,1594488398,Meg Wolitzer,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Anonymous,"Depressing trash. The author is sick to even imagine these unreal characters. I was depressed for a week after reading it.
If you want to torture someone give them this ""gem."""
1009,The Interestings,1594488398,Meg Wolitzer,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Anonymous,"The name of the book, the cover and the storyline caught my attention.  However, by the end of this book I found it to be just ""interesting"" .  The characters were not developed deeply enough for me and some were barely developed at all.   Boiled own to the basics, The Interestings is a book of one girl's/woman's struggle, through much of her life, with envy and jealousy."

1011,People of the Book,067001821X,Geraldine Brooks,Barnes and Noble,4,harstan,"In 1996, Sydney, Australian resident Hanna Heath receives a call from the UN as they want to use her rare book conservator expertise.  Apparently the renowned Sarajevo Haggadah, thought destroyed during the Bosnian War, has been found.  Harriet is euphoric as she knows the value of this incredible ancient Hebrew tome with its images.--------------    Although a loner whose only love is rare books, when Hanna meets the ¿savior¿ Muslim librarian Karaman, they are attracted to one another.  Still it is the book that holds her enthralled as she begins to uncover other artifacts of the past buried inside the pages (white hair, insect wing, salt, and a wine stain) and items missing (lost fasteners).  Each tells a unique story about who held the precious Sarajevo Haggadah.--------------------    PEOPLE OF THE BOOK is an interesting tale that uses the discoveries by Hannah to take the reader back in time to meet those who handled the ancient tome in various eras like 1940 Bosnia, 1480 Seville, and 1492 Barcelona, etc.  Each entry provides a historical conflict between a person protecting the book and those wanting to defile the book.  Throughout this superb fiction tale is the underlying message that the time for the Jews, Muslims and Christians to unite in peace is now not tomorrow as all have more in common than the differences that divide them.------------    Harriet Klausner"
1011,People of the Book,067001821X,Geraldine Brooks,Barnes and Noble,4,NatalieTahoe,"I love it when a book is able to seamlessly & eloquently combine fiction and history, leaving you wondering where fiction ends and truth begins.  As a voracious reader, I enjoy being able to delicately step through a story's pages & revel in the imagination of the writer, whilst learning a new nugget of actual history that sadly, didn't make any of my history classes in high school or college.  People of the Book does just that. This is a treat beyond all compare, beauty of history & story within front and back covers.  The Haggadah is a Jewish book that is read on the first night of Passover and tells the stories of enslavement, and the subsequent miracles performed by God which ultimately resulted in freedom.

In People of the Book, Hannah Heath is a rare books expert from Australia who travels to battle-torn Sarajevo in 1996.  Her task is to preserve the beautiful Sarajevo Haggadah that has just been uncovered after 100 years.  This Haggadah, though, is very different both in color and in sketch -- odd that it has survived throughout the years, since its original creation date sometime in the 14th century in Spain would have been during a time when drawing a person and illuminating it as such, although clothed, was considered offensive.  Somehow it has survived throughout the years from the Spanish Inquisition to the Holocaust.  Piqued by this curiosity, & passionate about preservation, Hannah also finds several items that are encapsulated within the pages of the book, such as a red stain, or a white hair, or an insect wing, & these objects become the opportunity for the author to explain in whose hands this book may have fallen, and the significance they earned in history.  We watch the book travel from Venice and to Vienna, & we learn the stories of the people who held the book, cared for the book, and saved the book, ultimately saving a critical piece of Jewish history.  Although some of these sections are fictionalized, the story of the Sarajevo Haggadah sends the message to the reader that it has become even more than just the colorful drawings and the binding of it, but about the people of the book, the people who fought and died for this incredible piece of history.

I found this refreshing & moving, & I was struck by the significance of a book that is of such beauty and importance to history.  It made me wonder who really were the people that protected it through hundreds of years?  Geraldine Brooks writes each character & scene in such a fluid manner, moments depicted with such heartbreak, such horror, and yet with hope.  It moved quickly for me & it wasn't long before I finished.  When I closed the book, I felt regret that I had never learned of this subject and felt that it was a duty of mine to learn more on such an important topic.

Reading People of the Book has made my visits to the museum a much different experience, awareness more profoundly etched within me, as I look at an object on display-in whose hands did this significant artifact fall, how did this manage to survive time and human ignorance to get to this museum behind protected glass, for me to view?  And on my list of places to visit, I will add Sarajevo no matter how battle-torn, simply to be able to visit with the amazing Sarajevo Haggadah, where it is on permanent display."
1011,People of the Book,067001821X,Geraldine Brooks,Barnes and Noble,4,jpeb,"I want to start by saying I loved the Year of Wonders, it was one of the best stories I ever read. This was also well written but not as genuine as Wonders. I am tired of female characters who are just a little too cool, hate their mothers and don't need anyone.
That said Hanna is interesting and the details of her work are explained in detail but I enjoyed learning about book conservation to a point. I found it a bit difficult to follow at times but loved the old stories and how it all tied in. This is a story of the injustices against the Jews throughout history and Brooks makes sure the Jewish characters are also the ones with character."
1012,The Secret Keeper,1439152802,Kate Morton,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"I throughly enjoyed this book. I have read all of Kate Morton's novels, and while The House at Riverton is still my favorite, this is a close second. It's set in the middle of WW2 and paints a very vivid snapshot of life and love and loss. Also, the end caught me completely off guard, and I am rarely surprised by endings. This book really makes you sit back and evaluate your priorities in life and the kind of person you want to be, and that's the mark of a good book in my opinion."
1012,The Secret Keeper,1439152802,Kate Morton,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,This was not my favorite Kate Morton (That would be the Forgotten Garden) but I would recommend it. Good read and plot... Keep them coming Kate!
1012,The Secret Keeper,1439152802,Kate Morton,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"About a third of the way into the book, I was giving up hope....   I have read all of Kate Morton's books and LOVED them, however; I was beginning to think that The Secret Keeper wasn't ""up to par"" with the others.  BAM!!  That's when the book caught me and it was very difficult to put down!!  If I didn't have my NOOK with me, then I was reading it on my NOOK phone app!!  This is THE BEST of Kate Norton's books, yet, and I cannot wait for the next!!"
1013,Better Homes and Gardens New Cook Book  ,0696215322,Better Homes and Gardens,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"I have owned several editions of the Better homes and Gardens Cookbook dating from the 1960's to the present. I find that this newest edition is excellent and has endeavoured to stay current regarding popular foods.   It contains all the yummy basics that are used regularly by cooks (Good, tasty and reliable bread recipies, (try the 'Biscuits supreme' they are the best I have ever had) delicious meat recipes, puddings, cakes and healthy salads etc.) without too much reliance on packaged and canned foods. The recipes can be unequivequally trusted.  My dislikes would be that the photos in the new edition are a little difficult to decipher and focus on, and that many of the foods needed more salt than the recipe called for (easily remedied-just add more salt the next time). These, however, would not deter me from buying it.    I would recommend this book to anyone (as I frequently do). It is well worth the money."
1013,Better Homes and Gardens New Cook Book  ,0696215322,Better Homes and Gardens,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,Bought this cookbook to replace a very worn and used basic cookbook from Better Homes.   After 30+ years mine was falling apart.   Not very happy with the spiral aspect of this cookbook.   Some pages have already torn  and the spiral is no longer holding them.   Overall it is an excellent cookbook with many of the same basic recipes from years ago and a bunch of new ones too.   For the price it was well worth the money.
1013,Better Homes and Gardens New Cook Book  ,0696215322,Better Homes and Gardens,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"I think this is a nice cook book, it has lots of info, it would make a nice gift. I had to add page tabs to help keep the pages from ripping out."

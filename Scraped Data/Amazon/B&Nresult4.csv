304,I Know This Much Is True,0060987561,Wally Lamb,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"This novel touched me in so many ways.  From the length of the novel (897 pages), I thought that it was going to be a dragged-out novel that was very slow paced and boring  however, my assumptions were proven wrong.  From the very first chapter of this extraordinary novel I was HOOKED!  The rate at which shocking events happen is uncanning and sudden.  Wally Lamb relates his characters to the audience both mentally and physically, while pertaining to the ethos and pathos of the readers.  You grow with the main character (Dominick) as he expresses his past, his fears, his doubts and feel every emotion that he is feeling.  This novel is overflowing with conflict, drama, uncertainty and resolutions that cause it to be a true tear-jerker.    Being a twin myself I noticed that the talented Wally Lamb got every detail about twins down correctly: the differences, the similarities, the hate, the love, and the jealousy. Each time an new event occurred in the novel, it caused me to think of my brother (my other half) due to the gifted writing style of Mr. Lamb. I, without a doubt, would recommend this novel!  It causes people to think about their past, their present and their future.  Furthermore, it gives people insight to the steps one needs to take in life on multiple levels: for forgiveness  for love  for redemption  and, of course, for peace."
304,I Know This Much Is True,0060987561,Wally Lamb,Barnes and Noble,4.5,modestindecisiv,"A year ago my teenage nieces recommended this book to me.  I typically do not like reading fictional accounts of mental illnesses, as I am a Mental Health Professional and typically people mistake mental disorders for others or portray them in a bad way.  Wally Lamb did not do this with I Know This Much is True.  Although the book is large, I could not put the book down and finished it in two weeks.  I found that he accurately portrayed schizophrenia and how schizophrenia affects loved ones.  However, that is not what the main story is in I Know This Much is True.  The book captivated me until the very end.  I find myself frequently discussing this book among my friends and recommending it to others as well.  I have also read other works by Wally Lamb and I have enjoyed them all, I do believe that I Know This Much is True is one of my favorites.  I had borrowed this book from my nieces and after reading I had to buy it and add it to my permanent collection.  I recommend this book to all types of people."
304,I Know This Much Is True,0060987561,Wally Lamb,Barnes and Noble,4.5,DEVILICIOUS,"Wally Lamb takes the reader on another fascinating journey into the heart and soul of three generations of dysfunction. Lamb weaves an intricate plot surrounding Dominick Birdsey and his paranoid schizophrenic identical twin Thomas, the boys of a meek and secretive mother. When Thomas ends up in a maximum security hospital, Dominick begins his quest to save his brother by reflecting on his past and his family's. Lamb successfully uses the ""story within a story"" to reveal the past.  Lamb breaks the readers' hearts with his all too real account of mental illness and the painful patterns of family dysfunction and tragedy. His characters develop and invite us into their world and their minds. The reader can't help but be connected to these characters. Incredible!"
305,Pet Sematary,1416524347,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.3,KVSallis,"This is the novel that made me love the horror genre, despite not loving most of the horror books I have read. It remains in my top ten, and possibly top five. It has made life difficult, as every horror-type book I have read in the twenty-some years since reading Pet Sematary has left me still thirsting. The depth of story is amazing. Characters build into flesh and play off each other's idiosyncrasies, and the pacing of action and suspense - particularly the long, strange walks to the place where the ground is sour - are painted with such realism that you cannot read this without feeling the stickiness of mud beneath your shoes, or feeling the movement of shadows behind you. What can I say? Do not worry about the movie. I've seen it - I love Herman Munster and the guy who played Louis, but it had to be a disappointment in trying to follow the raw energy of that book. It had no choice. But no matter... the book will tear you away from familiarity or comfort, and you'll forget any other perspective. INTENSE."
305,Pet Sematary,1416524347,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"This is by far the scariest King book i've read. the entire book is totally worth reading just to get to the last 50 or 60 pages. it starts out slow, but so does every Stephen King book, when you get 200 pages it starts to get scarier and scarier until it gets to the startling (and very disturbing) end."
305,Pet Sematary,1416524347,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.3,pagebender,"Pet Semetary is a very thrilling and suspenseful book. The author, Stephen King tells very good descriptions in all of his books. As soon as you are relaxed, he starts again. The evil is not even what you think it will be, or is it? Louis Creed just moved to maine and now has a perfect job at the University's hostpital, a perfect house, a perfect daughter and son, a perfect wife, and a perfect cat. The road seperating his house and new friend Jud Crandell's house is unmerciful. You can here the huge semi-trucks speeding and raging all day and all night. It has taken so many children's pets' lives. Will Louis Creed listen to what he needs to, or what he wants to??????"
306,She's Come Undone,0671021001,Wally Lamb,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"My mom was cleaning out the closets and came across ""She's Come Undone,"" which I had read several year ago. It is one of my all-time favorite books, one that I still bring up when discussing novels. I thought it was an amazing story, and I have always been amazed that it was written in first person by a man. The character of Dolores is so real and believable. I took the book from my mom and read it over again, and I still love the book, although since my first reading, I have had children and been through the death of a parent, just to name a couple of things, just many more life experiences. I do have to say that re-reading the book as a mother made it a whole different experience. Definitely came across much sadder to me, and I viewed the characters of Dolores, her mother, and her grandmother in a new light. I still laughed out loud more than a few times, but definitely cried more this time, too. It is still a fantastic book and one I will always keep in my collection. Wally Lamb is a gifted writer to have written the type of book that stays with you long after you put it down. I would not recommend a book that didn't have that effect on me."
306,She's Come Undone,0671021001,Wally Lamb,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Miss-C,I love this book. I reread it every few years. It reaches for you soul and challenges the standards and morals we set for ourselves through the heartbreaking tale of Dolores Price.
306,She's Come Undone,0671021001,Wally Lamb,Barnes and Noble,4.3,tiffany130,Someone gave me this book many years ago and I just put in on the shelf. I finally got around to reading it and I'm really glad I did. It was an interesting book that I couldn't put down by the second chapter. The character development was awesome and I like how it followed Delores from her childhood through adulthood. You really feel like you get to know her very intimately and you come to love her. I think any woman can relate to her story in one way or another and it touches you on a deep level. This is a 5 star book and it's hard to believe it was written by a man.
307,"The Wise Man's Fear (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #2)",0756404738,Patrick Rothfuss,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Country_Boy9,"Patrick Rothfuss has written another exceptional book. It was worth the wait given how brilliant of a book it truly is. Rothfuss really is a great story teller. For a book of nearly 1000 pages it would be easy to assume he weighed it down with excessive words and passages. That, however, wasn't the case at all. Every word, sentence and paragraph lent itself to the overall story. Nothing excessive and nothing wasted. He never bogged the story down with useless information making it so easy to get lost in the story. In this book he continues to develop the story and characters as fully as possible. I felt, while reading and now after completion, that he did a remarkable job establishing and maintaining the relationships between Kvothe and his friends, allies and enemies. His relationship with Denna and Elodin are particularly fascinating. Devi too. Ah, heck, his relationship with everyone is explained and explored brilliantly by Rothfuss. Rothfuss also introduces more characters for us to get to know. One of the things that makes this book and series so unique is that Rothfuss seems to know where he wants to take this story and is following his vision right to the end. He is giving us both the good and bad parts of his characters. Kvothe isn't perfect and neither is anyone else and he explores every side of his characters. We see their virtues and flaws. He just does a remarkable job in his writing style and story telling. I guess, for me, all I can say to sum this up is that I loved this book. I will gladly wait as long as needed if that's what it takes for Rothfuss to deliver another amazing book. I can't wait to see where Kvothe goes next."
307,"The Wise Man's Fear (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #2)",0756404738,Patrick Rothfuss,Barnes and Noble,4.7,angeleyesAS,"The Wise Man's Fear is amazing. He is clever, passionate and has a great sense of humor. I enjoyed reading the original characters' development and meeting new ones.  It is a great book of three parts. I found myself pausing and re-reading passages or phrases. Patrick Rothfuss's writing is a pleasure to read. His comedy is as perfectly done as his emotional heart-breaking tragedy. The great plotting and timing and somehow turning the improbable into possible kept me fascinated throughout. This is sheer fun and entertainment that will keep your anxiety at a peek until number three is out."
307,"The Wise Man's Fear (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #2)",0756404738,Patrick Rothfuss,Barnes and Noble,4.7,AquaeGrannus,"This wasn't the review I wanted to write, but rather a response to the whining review that came up when I went to 'review' wherin the Ebook price was the issue.  I read a LOT and this series may just be the most enjoyable one EVER.  I read fast and I spent 18 hours yesterday and just under 19 hours today with a literal all nighter finishing now at 4:42 AM.  how can that not be worth $15 ?  41 CENTS per hour is cheap entertainment these days.  Hey if you gotta save WAIT.  DON'T whine.  There's this amazing thing called a library and another called a second hand bookstore....Or there's a lend function for ebooks.  I for one want the author and the publisher to get theirs for bringing it so that they will have the incentive to KEEP up the good work."
308,Can You Keep a Secret?,0440241901,Sophie Kinsella,Barnes and Noble,4.3,bczwr2,"Like my headline: Don't read the book outdoors(Although I enjoyed reading it outside). I am a student. I bring my book to park, library, and of course to school. I always laugh out loud. People will turn their heads and will give me a this-kid-is-really-crazy-so-we-must-stay-away-from-him look. now you know why I said don't bring it outside! This book is not just a book written to make someone happy. This book is a perfect entertainment in a bind form. This is my very first book from Sophie Kinsella, Since then, I've started loving her books. Every time I see her books on Barnes and Noble, I totally go ""I must have a copy"". And now that I'm in book 3 of the shopaholic series, I have a faith in every Sophie Kinsella's book that it will never ever disappoint me."
308,Can You Keep a Secret?,0440241901,Sophie Kinsella,Barnes and Noble,4.3,thecollector0,I am a voracious reader who enjoys chicklit novels. This is one of the best books I have read. a must read if you like to laugh.
308,Can You Keep a Secret?,0440241901,Sophie Kinsella,Barnes and Noble,4.3,booksonmynook,Loved it. Not the first book I read by this talented author.
309,"City of Fallen Angels (The Mortal Instruments, #4)",1442403543,Cassandra Clare,Barnes and Noble,4.5,PJ_OShea,"This book will literally make your blood pump, fast. It will make you yell and hyperventilate and ignore the fact that it is midnight and you have to go to bed because you just really need to know what the hell (literally) is happening. This book is considerably darker than the last, and you're searching for a happy-go-lucky tale with a single conflict that gets resolved in the end in the most predictable and lovely way, you are not to read this book. If, however, you want a book that is exciting in the utmost way, with a unique plot, so many twists and turns that you feel a bit dizzy, and that also has laugh out loud moments (seriously, I laughed at my book in the middle of class... more embarrassing than you'd think) and, of course, includes romance, then read this book. The romance is not the blissful, easy sailing happy ending you would expect after City of Glass. Jace and Clary are faced with extreme strains on their relationship, yet they also have a rightful amount of passion and strength, and it is one of my favorite aspects of the series: They have a solid, realistic, believable relationship, and it has been consistently building for three books. If you have NOT read the previous Mortal Instruments books, don't read this. Seriously. Go back to the beginning. If you HAVE read them and it has been a while, you may wants to just google the previous books to remind yourself what happened just so this book doesn't have you stumbling in confusion at a few parts, because it goes full blast with very little summarizing about previous events. (I thought I remembered, but when I googled the summaries I found myself saying ""OH! I totally forgot about that!"" many, many times). Clare is a master at weaving together little details in the books and making a story that feels as real as the pages in your hands. As if you haven't realized already... I loved City of Fallen Angels. 
Warning: The end will have you cursing. Literally, out loud, to yourself, cursing. Because (as I looked up immediately after I finished the book..), City of Lost Souls doesn't come out until NEXT May."
309,"City of Fallen Angels (The Mortal Instruments, #4)",1442403543,Cassandra Clare,Barnes and Noble,4.5,theReader278,I love the series. Very ideal for the hot summer days. They will keep you entertained for hours
309,"City of Fallen Angels (The Mortal Instruments, #4)",1442403543,Cassandra Clare,Barnes and Noble,4.5,EAMC,"I am an avid reader of the MI series and love Cassandra Clare's writing style. I am sad to say, however, that this was not one of her best. COFA still has the classic Clare sarcasm and witty dialogue--which was the best part of the book FYI--but the rest fell short. The plot was predictable, there were certain things left unsaid in COG that appear to be blantantly obvious in COFA. But the worst part by far was that the main characters seem to have dropped 50 points in their IQ's. I realize that some character stupidity is needed for plot line, but this was ridiculous--especially where Clary is concerned. There will be parts of this novel where you will be screaming at her for being so blind and so moronic. And beware, if you are a Jace fan, you will want to hit something repeatedly throughout the book. Jace is not Jace in this book, and there is a very good reason why (Clare isn't just throwing it in there because she feels like it), but alas it will leave the plot feeling very non-Jaceish. Not to mention the Clary/Jace romance reads way too much like fanfiction. Furthermore, Simon (while a good addition to the POV's) STILL has not figured out how to be a vampire--and it's getting to the point where it is getting old very fast. But for the good points: there are some new character additions who were very amusing and distracted you from the idiocy of the originals. The plot was a good setup I suppose, but it really is too early to tell. And I loved the way Clare input some of the happenings from Infernal Devices in this one. I will say one thing though, I know that I will be screaming through this novel and the next, but there is no doubt in my mind that I will absolutely adore the 6th and final installment. It will just be a struggle to get there."
310,"Good in Bed (Cannie Shapiro, #1)",0743418174,Jennifer Weiner,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"This book is a good read, like all of Jennifer Weiner's other books. I caught myself thinking, ""Yeah, right"" quite a few times throughout the book, but that's what makes it a book, right? Cannie is a strong character, someone I would want to be friends with! The book goes deep into personal, body, and family issues, but it never gets too heavy. You will always be laughing again by the turn of the page.
I also recommend ""Certain Girls"", the sequel to ""Good in Bed""."
310,"Good in Bed (Cannie Shapiro, #1)",0743418174,Jennifer Weiner,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Lindsie,"This book was clever. Cannie (the stories main girl) is overweight and depressed. Her father wanted nothing to do with her, which is why she dumped Bruce in the scheme of things. She did not want what happened with her father to happen to her love life. Cannie is hyserical, witty, and clever. Down to the point I enjoyed 'Good in Bed.' I liked how to author turned the title of the book into a major issue (Moxie!)At some points I found it a little much (some of it just dragged on and on). But when it came dwn to the end I just could not put it down. Fanns of Jennifer Weiner this is a must read!"
310,"Good in Bed (Cannie Shapiro, #1)",0743418174,Jennifer Weiner,Barnes and Noble,4.2,DivaPrincess28,"I read this book after reading 3 other books by Jennifer and by dar this is probably my favorite of her books so far. I love the characters and I loved the way the story was written. I like the fact that the book didn't end with the main character losing a ton of weight to get back at oranything like that. The story was relatable and I felt that it ws put together nicely. I am about to start another book by Jennifer tonight since I just finished this one (took me about a week, but that is between work and stuff like that). I think people will really enjoy this book and will identify with the characters."
311,The Thorn Birds,0380018179,Colleen McCullough,Barnes and Noble,4.5,ambrosegirl60,This is my all time favorite book and movie.  I have watched the movie so many times that I lost track. Everyone should start with the book first because it goes in to more detail.
311,The Thorn Birds,0380018179,Colleen McCullough,Barnes and Noble,4.5,JessLucy,"The Thorn Birds is just a really great novel! The characters and their lives draw you in and make you sad when the novel ends. I could tell from the first page that this would be an awesome read; I really enjoyed the author's writing. If you like saga-style novels that cover a large portion of the character's lives, I would also recommend: The Pillars of the Earth by Ken Follet, The Far Pavillions and Trade Wind by M.M. Kaye, the Clan of the Cave Bear (and sequels) by Jean M. Auel. I also enjoyed Colleen McCullough's other books, such as The House on the Strand and On,Off."
311,The Thorn Birds,0380018179,Colleen McCullough,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"This novel is a Pop Culture Classic and it easy to understand why.  The characters are well-developed and become close to your heart, the plot is compelling and cumpulsively readable, and the historical facts about Australia are interesting.  I loved it and would recommend it to all - the love story between Meggie and Ralph will always haunt me.  I have to admit, once these characters grew older and the novel was taken over by the younger characters - I was ready for the novel to be done.  Somehow, the author catches time in this novel and the sense of when generations fade and new ones take over - the bittersweetness of that.  Please, read!"
312,The Graveyard Book,0060530928,"Neil Gaiman, Dave McKean",Barnes and Noble,4.2,ReaderMomKG,"My 4th grade son had to pick a Newbery Award winning book, so he picked this one because it was the newest.  At first the vocabulary was challenging.  My son was annoyed at having to look words up in the dictionary, but the story was so enticing that eventually acquiesced since the difficult words were so relevent to the theme of the story and the storyline.  Great overall lesson to be learned in the story, although I had to explain it to my son, due to the mature ideas.  Loved it and my son enjoyed doing his report, thanks to the book."
312,The Graveyard Book,0060530928,"Neil Gaiman, Dave McKean",Barnes and Noble,4.2,mmcmichael,"Check Out the Graveyard!
The Graveyard Book by Neil Gaiman, is one of the most interesting books I have ever read! Imagine a book about a graveyard! This setting alone is enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. From people breaking into houses, murder and talking to the dead, you never know what to expect next.
This tale is about a boy whose family is killed in the middle of the night. The boy, Bod, is forced to live in a graveyard where he is raised by ghosts. Bod can not leave the graveyard because there is an evil man named Jack who wants him dead. As you read Bod's adventures, you can just tell that this is going to be a great story.
The manner in which Gaiman writes this story makes you feel like it is normal to have ghosts as adoptive parents or family members. The ghosts talk just like people who are alive. The ghosts realize that they need help to raise the boy, or as they say, ""It will take a graveyard."" This book actually makes a graveyard sound like an interesting and lively place rather than a dull and boring place. How many people get to eat meals in a tomb? In addition, the characters such as Silas and Mr. and Mrs. Owens add to the plot by making the story more interesting. For instance, there are many questions raised when Silas says ""You must be alive or you must be dead to dance it-and I am neither."" It was obvious that Bod enjoyed living in the graveyard. However, it is hinted that he has to leave at some point, when Gaiman writes ""sometimes he can no longer see the dead.""
Gaiman's The Graveyard Book is a great book for readers who like to be on the edge of their seat and creeped out. It's packed with action and creepy stuff that will keep the reader interested and entertained. In addition, the story illustrates that there can be all kinds of families. As any ghost would agree, I give The Graveyard Book 10 tombstones out of 10 for all teenagers.."
312,The Graveyard Book,0060530928,"Neil Gaiman, Dave McKean",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Aradanryl,"I enjoyed the book as an adult, the story was engaging and I had a soft spot for Nobody.  I liked the twists and turns, the changes in relationships as Nobody grows up, and the ways Nobody met his challenges.  I grinned when he complained about learning certain words in multiple languages!My only concern:  I'm not sure of the age group listed, I wouldn't have liked the school assigning this book to my kids when they were 9 or 10, they wouldn't have handled the beginning well.  I'd have rated it higher if it was for a slightly older group."
313,The Light Between Oceans,1451681739,M.L. Stedman,Barnes and Noble,4.3,shayrp76,"Tom Sherbourne finds peace as a light house keeper on a secluded island after the brutality he witnessed in war.  The routine and distance helps him sort out his emotions and brings him peace.  He couldn&rsquo;t imagine sharing his life with anyone until he marries Isabel and she makes their rock feel like home.  Their secluded life has its share of happiness but heartbreak soon sets in after several miscarriages making the seclusion feel suffocating for Isabel.  When a boat washes up in their little world carrying a dead man and a living baby, life seems to take a wonderful turn.  Isabel has never been happier but Tom is plagued with unease and when a trip back to the mainland brings troubling facts to light he yearns to do what is just.
An emotional rollercoaster doesn&rsquo;t begin to describe what it felt like to read this.  With each page I questioned what I had felt while reading the previous page.  The characters are amazingly real with such humanity that I wanted to talk to them or yell at them.  There are a couple of characters that I hated to love and one that I loved to hate so that made it very hard to decide where I stood with each individual story line. I have no complaints about this one.  I am already recommending it and will continue to do so for a long time to come."
313,The Light Between Oceans,1451681739,M.L. Stedman,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"Great book, beautifully written.  In a time where Fifty Shades of Grey and other such rubbish get rave reviews it's nice to read a book worthy of the accolades it has received.  I am looking forward to more books from this author."
313,The Light Between Oceans,1451681739,M.L. Stedman,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"Loved it...couldn't put it down. The story is heartbreakingly beautiful and while the ending acknowledges the pain, it also offers hope.  This book is in my top 10 of all time.  I'll be thinking about the story for quite a while."
314,"Inkheart (Inkworld, #1)",0439709105,"Cornelia Funke, Anthea Bell",Barnes and Noble,4.4,shhhDinaisreading,"I read this book during the winter months, in front of the fireplace... this book really pulled me into the story, like I'd been swept off along with Meggie and all. It has a very unusual plot, the characters are strange, but I couldn't put it down! It begins to unfold in such a way you feel opted to answer the character's questions (the many there are!) All in all, it's difficult to explain. But I loved it! This book was recomended for ages 12... both my friend and I read it (we're 16) and fell in love for it! I am not sure why this book received bashing from the previous reader, but it is so imaginitave. Something very fantasy-oriented, and that's what makes it so much fun!"

The plot is engaging, the characters believable, and the real-world elements were believable as well. I can't say enough about the characters- they seem as real as anyone I've ever met- when I was reading I could almost hear them in my ear. This book has so much wonderful imagery, dialogue, and scenes that paint pictures in your mind. It's listed as a children's book, but I'm a teenager, and I love it! (My mother's reading it, and she likes it too- there's really no age limit)"

315,Who Moved My Cheese?,0091883768,"Spencer Johnson, Kenneth H. Blanchard",Barnes and Noble,3.8,Anonymous,"A short story about 2 mice and 2 'little people' in a maze looking for cheese. Of course 'cheese' is just a metaphor for what you want in life (such as money, the ideal job), and the 'maze' represents where you are looking for what you want (such as your family, an organization). As the story goes, one of the characters (Haw) learns to deal with change successfully and writes what he has learned on the maze wall. In this way, the reader gets the main points in the book and can learn too how to deal with life's changes. A little book that is big on wisdom, many should find it entertaining and useful. Also recommended The Sixty-Second Motivator -another short story that is to the point and practical"
315,Who Moved My Cheese?,0091883768,"Spencer Johnson, Kenneth H. Blanchard",Barnes and Noble,3.8,Anonymous,My workplace required this book to be read by all of us mice after they moved our cheese. What they did was lower our pay and added more responsibilities to our jobs. At the same time they restructured and fired all those that were not pulling their weight or voiced their opinions. As a scare tactic perhaps? Its a book that tries to make you understand change and to deal better with changes that you have no control over. Did it help? Not really! I'm still bitter but I have a job...yea me.
315,Who Moved My Cheese?,0091883768,"Spencer Johnson, Kenneth H. Blanchard",Barnes and Noble,3.8,Anonymous,"This book may very well be the stupidest book a human has ever written. It is condescending and an enormous rip-off. It certainly does not even come close to deserving the praise given to it. The reviewers must have felt such immense relief to finally finish the book, that it skewed their judgment."
316,A Walk in the Woods,0307279464,Bill Bryson,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"This is an almost brilliant and deeply flawed work, which I nonetheless highly recommend for its humor and wealth of easily-digested historical and environmental information.     One of the things that characterizes the absolute pinnacle of comedic achievement is the willingness to make any and every sort of spectacle of onesself for a laugh...along with the comedic sensibility to carry it off. Gilda Radner as the girl scout. Carol Burnett wearing the curtain rod. Richard Pryor as himself. Bill Bryson proves as early as page 19 that self-humiliating physical comedy can work even in print. One of the problems with this book, however, is that he gets most of his laughs by similarly humiliating everyone he encounters during his on-again, off-again hike of the Appalachian Trail. He has sadly forgotten another of the hallmarks of comedic genius: laughing with, rather than at, one's felllow human being. Bryson seems to revel in a mean-spiritedness that is all the more disturbing in light of his obvious intelligence and insight. He is talented enough to forgo the cheap shots and, besides, he should know better. I began to understand why his family was afraid of him embarassing them.    Another and more baffling problem is Bryson's seeming blindness to the rich experience of the wilderness. He has a sort of generalized awe for the majesty of the forest as a whole, here and there, almost as if he occasionally remembered to take a snapshot. But he so belabors his observation that every stretch of forest is like every other, one tree just like the next, that you can't help wondering, as he very frequently does himself, what he is doing there. I personally find a small miracle every three inches along whatever trail I walk. His failure to do so, and the prohibitions he mentions against leaving the trail, made me repeatedly envision a wall of streaky glass along both sides of the path between him and the forest. Which in turn made me picture the trail eventually coming to resemble a sort of museum of the outdoors. Maybe it already is one.    Bryson is certainly honest. He makes no bones about whining and wishing for Big Macs, and his clear inability to enjoy the here-and-now. Yet a wistful tone is audible when he speaks of the destruction of the forests, and he has lovingly gathered and presented such a wealth of environmental and historical facts as to nearly make this book a primer for the budding environmentalist.    In the end, Bryson himself becomes as fascinating and frustrating as the trail itself. Why is such an insightful person so insensitive to the forest's small delights, and to his fellow human beings? How can he be so courageous and whiny at the same time? (Good time to mention his sidekick, Katz, who somehow actually manages to pull it off with more aplomb. Maybe because Bryson tore him apart so thoroughly at the beginning that you feel sorry for him forever after.)    Despite Bill Bryson's being older than I by a number of years, he seems so like young kids now. So lost without modern 'conveniences,' mainly because that is all they know. And yet, little by little, in this book, you can see the light get in around Bryson's blinders. He begins to find civilization ugly and wish for the forest whenever he leaves it.    Which is, all in all, an encouraging message."

In fact, I would be laughing so much that people would ask me what I was laughing about. While it took Bryson's excellent writing to put the story on paper, it took Katz to make it worth reading. This is the story of two college buddies who reunite in their 40s to walk the Appalachian Trail. Neither one are in shape for their endeavor but that doesn't deter them. Along the way they meet some interesting people (Mary Ellen for one) and find themselves in some funny situations. This is a must read for anyone. In fact, it should be required academic reading."

It is not only hilarious, but incredibly informative, which are not two things that usually go together.  I've been reading this book in my quiet house only to laugh right out loud and then go in search of someone so I can read the passage out loud!  I am a hiker as well, and can greatly appreciate Bryson's experiences.  I know it is not a new release, but I don;t care.  Go get it and then pass it along.  I am on my way to get In a Sunburned Country because I am almost done with this one."
317,I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,0553279378,Maya Angelou,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Cassidy54,"Albert Ellis once said, ""The art of love.is largely persistence"" and in I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings by critically acclaimed Maya Angelou, persistence is exactly what young Maya intends to keep strong. The completely autobiographical memoir lures the reader in with its depiction of the lives of blacks in the Deep South during the Depression. Within the heart of rural Stamps, Arkansas little Maya and her brother Bailey are prisoners of the tight knit community and all that it brings. Along with their sacrilegious Grandmother, who is constantly in a fit in regards to any lack of obedience, Maya struggles to find her place. On the surface, she plays a character who genuinely enjoys living among her interesting quartet of a family, her Grandmother, her physically disabled Uncle Willie, and her true joy in life, Bailey are all she has in the world until her estranged father arrives to take Maya and Bailey to live with ""Mother Dearest."" The life of the big city entrances Maya and her imagination. While living with her mother, Maya receives an education, and meets all sorts of different people, one of those people being Mr. Freeman, Maya's mother's boyfriend. When Mr. Freeman takes advantage of eight year old Maya, it becomes clear that the children must be sent back home to their little town of Stamps. 
For the rest of Maya's time in Stamps, she encounters all sorts of different types of people; people who will make a great impact in due time, and those who simply play a role in every day fun. I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings portrays a great tale of a young girl's battle to suppress the boredom of country life and strive for a greater meaning to her existence while also dealing with the inevitable battles of growing up.
 Maya Angelou's writing is flawless and each phrase is master crafted to perfection as she explores the truth of her childhood. ""Looking through the years, I marvel that Saturday was my favorite day in the week. What pleasures could have been squeezed between the fanfolds of unending tasks? Children's talent to endure stems from their ignorance of alternatives."" (113) The beauty of her words flow together in a magnificent mosaic of phrases and each step in this eloquent autobiography leaves a lingering sense of compassion in the reader's heart. The heart wrenching moments, though distressing, are overshadowed by the little joys Maya always seems to find. The way she confronts the temptations and urges throughout her teenage years are exposed in great detail as she takes little steps to achieve what she considers the ""normality"" of being a teenage girl. 
I truly enjoyed this radiant and joyful story with its realistic balance of pain and pleasure. The reader will be forever mindful of this little girl's journey into adulthood, the quest for love, and the long standing clash with society."
317,I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,0553279378,Maya Angelou,Barnes and Noble,4.2,kiwiTA,"Typically I read articles on individuals rather than autobiographies - they seem self promoting and long (to me).  This reads more like fiction but gives you the idea of where one of America's finest writers was born from.  I have always had high regard for Ms. Angelou.  Not being an avid reader in the past, I have resolved myself to a New Years resolution to one book a month.  She was January and a wonderful way to start."

I read this book without having any prior knowledge of Maya Angelou's life, aside from the fact that she was a poet. I was quite surprised by the amount of issues she had to overcome growing up, and am happy that she is out there writing about her experiences and essentially telling people that it's OK to be awkward."

319,"City of Lost Souls (The Mortal Instruments, #5)",1442416866,Cassandra Clare,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Ginger-Read-Reviews,"First off, let us get this out of the way...

City of Lost Souls is not as good as City of Bones, City of Ashes or City of Glass. Sorry.
City of Lost Souls is better than City of Fallen Angels. You're welcome.


The story picks up right where Fallen Angels left off. You remember? That horrific cliff hanger that the wonderful Ms. Clare made us all so angry with. Jace and Sebastian have vanished.  Clary and the Scooby pals are distraught and the Clave has launched a search, though more for Sebastian than for Jace.  

The tale skips around from person to person quite often.  You know what is happening with Clary, Simon, Izzy, Alec and Magnus, and even Maia and Jordan get good coverage.  It became less and less the story of Clary & Jace the star-crossed lovers.  It became everyone's story.  Jace actually gets less play in this installment than any other.

So, if you are a Jace fan (like me), you may be disappointed.  I wasn't.  Jace was obnoxious.  I like him broody and egotistical. Not brain dead and carefree. Which is the effect Sebastian has on him.  I was all right with the lack of Jace.

On the other hand, if you are a Simon fan, you may get great satisfaction here.  Simon was less whiny, in my opinion.  Still just as hilarious as always. He is finding out where he belongs and with who (wink, wink), who cares for him, where his relationships lie and what his place in the Shadowhunter world is. Maybe he isn't the outsider he thought he was, only linked by his long friendship with Clary. 

I know there are many, many Magnus fans out there so he earns a mention, right? Magnus, as always, delivers.  There seems to be no end to the sacrifices he is willing to make for this band of misfit demon killers. Especially where Alec is concerned.  Or is there a limit? You'll have to read the book to find out what the heck I am talking about! 

There are so many love stories taking place simultaneously here, romance fans will be drooling over it.  But, for me, that was the downfall. So much lovey lovey, not enough fight fight.  I expected a big epic battle to save Jace's soul.  There was a battle. It wasn't very epic.  There was a moment that reminded me of the most memorable Buffy/Angel moment. I apologize to those who won't get the reference.  But we will have to wait for City of Heavenly Fire for this epic battle.  Since it is earmarked for release in spring of 2014...it's going to be a long wait.

All in all it's a good read for TMI fans.  It actually renewed my love for the series and I think I will be revisiting each book before the release of the final installment."

320,"Where'd You Go, Bernadette",0316204277,Maria Semple,Barnes and Noble,4.1,OurBookAddiction,"What fun this book was! Quick recap of key characters:

Bernadette &ndash; Award winning architect turned recluse who hides out the days in an airstream camper she had installed by her house so she can avoid the house help. She also has a virtual assistant in India who she hires to basically handle all the day to day duties she has including ordering food, shopping, and planning all the details of their upcoming vacation (at only 75 cents an hour which I confess gave me a momentary idea before I was horrified that I even considered it!).

Elgin &ldquo;Elgie&rdquo; &ndash; Her Microsoft genius husband who really has no clue of the life that exists around him, including his own family. Such an enigma that he thinks it&rsquo;s totally appropriate to work at the office without his shoes walking around in only his socks&hellip;which is probably gross considering how much it rains in Seattle.  How cool would it be to be considered such a god that you could walk around funking up the air around the office and no one would dare tell you to put your shoes back on?

Balakrishna &ldquo;Bee&rdquo; &ndash; their daughter who is an extremely intelligent child who is probably the most normal character in the book!

The Gnats &ndash; What Bernadette calls the other private school moms who are a bunch of self-absorbed and narcissistic women. Their antics constantly had me laughing, while another part of me wanted to poke them in their eyeballs. I actually respected Bernadette a lot for her reserved way of dealing with them instead of giving a karate chop to the neck.

Truly a group of 1 percenters as another reviewer described. Money seems to come out of the water faucets for these people. I suspect they might even use dollars as toilet paper.  Their reality is unimaginable for the other 99 percent of the population. Yet somehow&hellip;I liked Bernadette. Yes she seems like a nut job and the family has no idea how the rest of the world lives, but she is a woman who loves her child.

I found it laugh out loud funny throughout. The majority was written in various forms of correspondence format. I was really pulling for Bernadette despite all her flaws (because are we not all flawed? Just in different ways?). I was really pulling for Bernadette and hoping she would be found. As for if she was, you will have to read for yourself to find out.

People will probably either love it or not, depending on whether or not you can suspend belief while reading it."
320,"Where'd You Go, Bernadette",0316204277,Maria Semple,Barnes and Noble,4.1,janstan1,"I read this as part of an online book club. As such, I was supposed to read it in 4 parts. I couldn't do it. I just kept reading to the end. The author used a style of writing that made me just want to keep reading to find out what came next. It was funny. Some of what the characters experienced was just plain awful(but funny too!) I loved it and would recommend it."

321,Where the Red Fern Grows,0375806814,Wilson Rawls,Barnes and Noble,4.6,immortalimp83,"This book was wonderful.  I read it for the first time in third grade as a lonely third grader who had recently moved from another state.  I already had a dog but I wanted one of my own afterwards. In fourth grade I got a new miniature schnauzer puppy and named her Little Ann after the dog in this book.  My Little Ann died 2 novembers ago at 15 years old.  I was cleaning out some of my childhood books and recently found my old copy and reread it with my sister.  It made us both cry, but we still love it."
321,Where the Red Fern Grows,0375806814,Wilson Rawls,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"Where the Red Fern Grows is an amazing book about a boy named Billy who lives in the little town of Ozarks.  There he works very hard to buy two red bone hounds.  The two dogs, Old Dan and Little Ann, seem to be able to always understand Billy and the three are inseparable.  Billy trains his dogs to hunt, and they become an incredible team.  Throughout the story they face many challenges in competitions, bets, and much more.  This book was so intriguing.  I had always heard of this book, but never took the time to read it.  I'm so glad I chose to read this book.  It shows the devotion of two dogs to each other and to their master.  I would warn parents that this book contains some blood, so the child should be at least about third or fourth grade.  Other than that, I think anyone who reads this book will fall in love with the characters and the touching plot.  Throughout this book I laughed and even cried. The description is amazing and will take your breathe away."

322,Neverwhere,0060557818,Neil Gaiman,Barnes and Noble,4.3,DeDeFlowers,Before reading Neverwhere I would never have called myself a 'fantasy' fan. I was almost turned off from reading this based on its classification. I am so happy I did read it though. It's turned into one of my favorite books. It pulls you out of reality while you read it and suddenly you are in another world. The characters are great and the plot is brilliant. I have now read every book by Neil Gaiman and I love them all. He recently did a book signing that I attended and all I could do was thank him for being a writer. I would say the age range for this book should be 14+. A couple scenes are graphic with adult themes. Neverwhere turned me on to the fantasy genre. It's worth a read.
322,Neverwhere,0060557818,Neil Gaiman,Barnes and Noble,4.3,basiaaa,"One of my favorite books of all time, so ingenious and imaginative and hillarious! Mr Croup and Mr Vandemar are the most delicious villains. And Richard's adventures in the underworld are mesmerizing. Read this book 3 times, and each time it's a so satisfying."
322,Neverwhere,0060557818,Neil Gaiman,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,I loved this book from start to finish. To me it reminded   me of a darker version of Alice in Wonderland. It seemed   to me the book had a sense of magic to it.  I love the   unexpected plot of the story.  There was very little that I   did not like to this book.

324,Fangirl,0000000000,Rainbow Rowell,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"This story isn't what I expected. I figured it would just be about some girl obsessing over a fictional character, but it really has more meaning than that.
This is a story about a girl who is learning to live her life without her twin sister holding her hand along the way. Cath, to me, is a very relatable character. We all have crushes on characters from novels, admit it. Many of us go overboard with our crushes, like Cath.
The author did an outstanding job at portraying Cath as a true fangirl.
This deserves a nice round of applause. I'll definitely tell my friends about this book."
324,Fangirl,0000000000,Rainbow Rowell,Barnes and Noble,4.5,kimberlyfaye,"You guys, I&rsquo;ve gone and done it again&hellip; I&rsquo;ve fallen in love with Rainbow Rowell&rsquo;s characters and their stories. There&rsquo;s so much I love about this book (like, every. single. thing. about it) and I&rsquo;m going to try not to gush. Too much. I don&rsquo;t feel like I can truly do this book justice with a review, but I&rsquo;m going to try.

&ldquo;To really be a nerd, she&rsquo;d decided, you had to prefer fictional worlds to the real one.&rdquo;

Cath is a nerd. She writes slash fan fiction about Simon Snow, boy magician, using the name Magicath. She&rsquo;s such a Simon Snow fan and writes such complex fan fic, she has a fan base of her own. She&rsquo;s a big deal in certain circles online. Real life is a little different. She&rsquo;s insecure and lives in the shadow of her twin sister, Wren. While Wren likes to party, chase boys and experience all life has to offer, for better or worse, Cath is more reserved. She&rsquo;d much rather spend the night writing and fostering her online friendships than hanging out at parties or in bars. She&rsquo;s so introverted at times that it&rsquo;s almost painful. But, she&rsquo;s an easy character to identify with. She&rsquo;s as awkward as can be, but she&rsquo;s lovable, strong and smart. She&rsquo;s loyal to those she&rsquo;s closest to, even when they might not deserve it. She&rsquo;s completely adorkable. I loved her almost immediately, but &ldquo;Emergency Kanye Party&rdquo; solidified it for me.

&ldquo;There are other people on the Internet. It&rsquo;s awesome. You get all the benefits of &lsquo;other people&rsquo; without the body odor and the eye contact.&rdquo;

Cath and Wren head off to their new lives in college at University of Nebraska-Lincoln. For the first time in their lives, they won&rsquo;t be living together. It&rsquo;s time for each of them to experience life without being a crutch for the other. Cath&rsquo;s new roommate, Reagan, is pretty much her polar opposite. She&rsquo;s a partier. She&rsquo;s always out with a different guy, despite the fact that Levi is always hanging out in her room. Cath assumes they&rsquo;re dating, but the truth is more complicated than that. Somewhere along the way, Levi becomes more than &ldquo;Reagan&rsquo;s friend.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s Cath&rsquo;s friend and confidant. He&rsquo;s there for her. Their chemistry is strong and sweet.

&ldquo;Oh, put that away,&rdquo; Cath said with distaste. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to get charm all over my sister &ndash; what if we can&rsquo;t get it out?&rdquo;

&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t have words for what Levi was. He was a cave painting. He was The Red Balloon. She lifted her heels and pulled him forward until his face was so close, she could look at only one of his eyes at a time. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re magic,&rdquo; she said.

I adored Levi from the moment he appeared on the pages. He&rsquo;s an adorable farm boy. He&rsquo;s sweet and thoughtful. He always went out of his way to try to include Cath, despite being turned down again and again. There was more to him than met the eye, as Cath began to find out. When he began meeting her at the library to walk her home from study &ldquo;dates&rdquo; with her classmate, Nick, I started to hope there was a glimmer of something more there.

&ldquo;Cath liked Levi. A lot. She liked looking at him. She liked listening to him &ndash; though sometimes she hated listening to him talk to other people. She hated the way he passed out smiles to everyone he met like it didn&rsquo;t cost him anything, like he&rsquo;d never run out. He made everything look so easy&hellip; &rdquo;

As you might expect, Cath was completely out of her element at college. She was so uncomfortable in new situations that she was afraid to try to find the dining hall, so she was more or less living off energy bars. Reagan and Levi finally force her somewhat out of her comfort zone and get her out and about. For a girl with very little social life, Cath has the attention of several guys. Throughout the story there&rsquo;s Able, her quasi-boyfriend from home, her study-date/writing-partner Nick, and Levi. I&rsquo;ll let you find out for yourself how that all shakes out though. There&rsquo;s so many sweet, swoon-worthy scenes and good, old-fashioned teenage angst that you need to experience it all for yourself.

&ldquo;Apparently, I&rsquo;m good for something,&rdquo; Wren said. &ldquo;You keep stealing all my best lines.&rdquo;

Wren is a minor character in the majority of the book, at least in a physical sense. She&rsquo;s not around very often. She&rsquo;s off doing her own thing, leaving Cath to live her own life. To find herself. While they shared some of the same friends and interests pre-college, I&rsquo;m not entirely sure Wren and Cath could be any different. They each went through a lot in this novel. I think they both wound up stronger and better because of the events that occurred though. I think their relationship with each other, while different than it was when they left for school, became more solid, too. It wasn&rsquo;t an easy road though.

&ldquo;I feel like&hellip; what happened last night was just an aberration. Like it could only have happened in the middle of the night, when he and I were both really tired. Because if it had been daylight, we would have seen how inappropriate it was -&rdquo;

&ldquo;How do you feel when I smile at you?&rdquo; he asked &ndash; and then he did smile at her, just a little.
&ldquo;Like an idiot,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;And like I never want it to stop.&rdquo;

The romance in this book was absolutely swoon-worthy in that way only young adult books can be. It was sweet and innocent. It just made me smile. I was absolutely charmed by nearly every character in this book. At the end, despite the fact that there wasn&rsquo;t a cliffhanger and really, everything was resolved, I was in no way ready to give these characters up. I&rsquo;ve had such a book hangover from them it&rsquo;s been nearly impossible to think about writing this review.

&ldquo;I feel sorry for you, and I&rsquo;m going to be your friend.&rdquo;

&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re so helpless sometimes. It&rsquo;s like watching a kitten with its head trapped in a Kleenex box.&rdquo;

Whether they&rsquo;re main or secondary, Rainbow Rowell writes amazing characters. They&rsquo;re real. I want to know them personally. By the end of the book, I feel like I do know them. This book was absolutely no exception. Reagan was just what Cath needed in a roommate. She was sassy and outgoing. She pushed Cath. She helped her grow. I want her to be my friend. Professor Piper also helped Cath come into her own. She was everything a professor should be. She was supportive, but she still pushed her. Cath became a better writer because of it. Cath&rsquo;s father was another favorite. He was complicated. He had issues. But, he was a great dad. I loved their banter.

&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s just so good. Nobody writes Simon and Baz like Magicath. I&rsquo;m in love with her Baz. Like, in love. And I used to be a major Simon/Agatha shipper.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Sometimes&hellip;,&rdquo; Cath said, &ldquo;when I&rsquo;m reading canon, I forget that Simon and Baz aren&rsquo;t in love.&rdquo;

One of the things I loved most about this book was the way that Rowell integrated the fan fiction so well with Cath&rsquo;s real life story. This is something most authors couldn&rsquo;t pull off, but she does it absolutely flawlessly. First of all, I just loved reading the Simon Snow stories. It took me back to the days where I would read a TON of Harry Potter fan fiction to get through the excruciating wait between books. I read more Harry/Draco slash than I should probably admit. (Don&rsquo;t judge me.) I loved seeing what the fan fic writers did with J.K. Rowling&rsquo;s characters in an alternate universe. I enjoyed reading what Cath did with Simon and Baz in her stories. The world-building in the fan fic and the Simon Snow &ldquo;book&rdquo; chapters was wonderful. Complex. It made me wish Gemma T. Leslie and her books were real. I also loved that Cath&rsquo;s writing in the fan fic world closely mirrored what was happening in her real life. The details about Cath&rsquo;s on-campus life were incredible, too. I felt like I was with her. I actually have a good friend who went to school at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and he was in awe of the details I was describing from the boo&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s nothing more profound than creating something out of nothing.&rdquo; Her lovely face turned fierce. &ldquo;Think about it, Cath. That&rsquo;s what makes a god &ndash; or a mother. There&rsquo;s nothing more intoxicating than creating something from nothing. Creating something from yourself.&rdquo;

This is a beautiful coming-of-age story. It&rsquo;s about growing up and finding yourself while trying not to lose all the things (and people) who have made you YOU so far. It&rsquo;s about learning how to accept new people into your life, while not isolating those who have been there for years. It&rsquo;s about family and friends, crushes and love. It made me feel like I was a college freshman again. The situations were *that* real. The characters were charming and believable. The dialogue ranged from witty to sweet to teasing to moving and it was sheer perfection. I went through the whole gamut of emotions while reading this book. I was in Cath&rsquo;s corner the entire time.

&ldquo;When you break from behind the tree, it&rsquo;s because you want to. It&rsquo;s the first breath after a long dive. Branches snap under your feet, and the world is hotter and brighter. Ready or not, here I come. Here I come, ready or not.&rdquo;"

By the end of the book, when one truly understands what Owen was about, it becomes clear just how strong both the book and the character turn out to be. By then, all the details make sense, the meaning behind each chapter becomes clear, and you are left with the feeling that you have finished a truly remarkable book. This book truly is absolute perfection in a novel. There's not much of that in the modern writing world. The first few chapters are slow going, but not to delay the miraculous end ... only to set the oh so important stage and plot. And oh, what a stage, what a cast of characters, what dialogue and New England settings.
Treat yourself to a true modern day masterpiece. By the end, you'll be sobbing, turning back pages saying, ""Why? Why? This can't be,"" while knowing it HAD to be. I wish I could shake the hand that has written such an amazing tale. A Prayer for Owen Meany is undoubtedly one of the best books I have ever read. The six hundred page novel is filled to the brim with unexpected sarcasm and incredible hilarity. The novel, told from the point of view of John Wheelrwight, tells the story of an unnaturally small and high-pitched boy named Owen Meany. Throughout the story, John Irving made this character, a character so complex and so riveting, to be one of the most incredible protagonists American literature has ever seen."

Are the seemingly random incidents in life truly random, or does everything happen for a reason? Owen Meany knows the answer to that question. Once again John Irving has created a world full of characters you will love and never forget, a story that will make you laugh and make you cry. But most of all A Prayer for Owen Meany will touch your heart and make you believe."
325,A Prayer for Owen Meany,0552135399,John Irving,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"This book can definitely be described as a true novel.  I have shared it with so many relatives and friends that I had to buy a second copy (paperback) because my first one was falling apart.

I found the story brought out a fact I learned many years ago in grade school.  Our seventh grade teacher pointed out that each of us was put on this earth for a very special reason and Owen Meany brought that fact back into my life.

I am very grateful that John Irving wrote and shared this novel with us."
326,White Oleander,0316182540,Janet Fitch,Barnes and Noble,4.5,XXXOOOBookwormOOOXXX,"I never believed that a book could truly take hold of your emotions and exhilerate your senses, but this story drew me into the folds of surprise, heartbreak, and amazing prose.
The story is told from Astrid Magnussen's point of view. She is a young girl (story goes from age 12-18), who lives with her mother, Ingrid, who is a smooth, freeminded poet. They live in an apartment in Hollywood, California. They go to museums, read books by Dmitry and Dostoyevsky, and do poetry readings. Ingrid uses her charm to lure in men and have carefree relationships, but she gets too serious in one of these relationships. After the man breaks it off with Ingrid, she kills him. She is then put into prison and sentenced for life.
So begins Astrid's life of foster care and life altering changes. Throughout the story, Astrid is at 6 different homes, including a children's center. Each home is filled with people and experiences that all take their toll on Astrid and her upbringing. These include: getting involved with a MUCH older man, gun shot wounds, starvation, and a death, to name a few. During her time at these homes, she corresponds with her mother with letters, in which Ingrid is still trying to shape her daughter...even through prison. Astrid soon realizes that her mother wants her to remain unhappy in these homes, so she will still be &quot;needed&quot; by her daughter, and so that she can still influence Astrid into becoming like her.
This is a book where you hope and plead for a good ending, but you're never sure if it will happen or not. This books is remarkable. You'll be mesmerized by Astrid Magnussen adventures. The characters are astonishingly well drawn and practically leap off the page. The writing is a work of art in itself. The plot takes you on a tour through the darkest depths of the human experience and still manages to leave you with a glimmer of hope at the end. A must read book if ever there was one! This book captures the difficulties of &quot;broken families&quot; and the struggle of trying to make your way in the world when you start off at a disadvantage. The languages and images are beautiful and will stay with you. It's one girl's story, but this is one of those books that gives voice to hard truths."
326,White Oleander,0316182540,Janet Fitch,Barnes and Noble,4.5,MaggieMcKickButt,"This book was amazing! It was so much better than the movie! Compared to the book, the movie was absolutely horrible. The characters were pretty much the same. I loved Astrid's strength and bravery throughout the entire book. Even though her mother and other people kept putting her down, she got through it. I felt like I was Astrid the entire book and it made me sad and a little depressed. I wish things like what Astrid went through never happen. It's just not fair."
326,White Oleander,0316182540,Janet Fitch,Barnes and Noble,4.5,LizabeeAK,"This book is not just about a mother and a daughter, nor is it a catalogue of foster care atrocities. It is the journey of a girl, Astrid, as she discovers that it is possible to remember, as well as to move on; to be able to understand hate, as well as love. Reads like a mix of poetry and journalism. I won't forget it."
327,"Legend (Legend, #1)",039925675X,Marie Lu,Barnes and Noble,4.5,BooksWithBite,"It took me a while to come up with this review, cause well  I wasn't sure what to say. I love it so much that I am speechless. I don't think that words can do this book justice, but I will try to do my best with out spoiling it.

What grabbed me the most about this book is the thrilling adventure that the plot goes on. So much excitement that fills with reader that is leave you reading faster. I enjoyed reading along as the plot plunged faster into amazing ride of fighting and adventure.

The characters of this book were divine. Written so passionately, you feel the characters come alive in your heart as you feel their emotions. The betrayal, the hurt, the learning of truth that blinds their eyes. I admit that a certain parts of this book, my mouth hung open. Both characters, June and Day fight for what they believe and know. Many uncovered truths will shed light of what they really know.

The love interest is just the way I like it. Complicated yet simple. Many obstacles stand in their way. I adore that June and Day are a perfect match. They are flawless, yet flawed. Strong, yet weak. Love, yet they sacrifice. These two make me want to laugh yet cry. As the reader, I hung to their every thought and emotion. I love it.

If you want a well written, adventurous book, filled with non-stop exposed the evasive techniques of the government have you dodging every corner, every page turn. I loved that Ms. Lu created such a world that every reader can't contain themselves and we must share. Legend is an amazing book! It ""Awed"" me through and through. This book is a must read!"

It reminds me very much of the hunger games and has the same idea. Two teens are forced to hunt each other down but end up falling in love and they end up questioning all they have ever known. I would highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone!
327,"Legend (Legend, #1)",039925675X,Marie Lu,Barnes and Noble,4.5,remaven,To everyone who loved the Hunger Games books this is at least as good if not better. The story and characters grabbed me from page 1.  Why this is classified as a young adult (Hunger Games was also young adult) is beyond me as I believe all ages will enjoy it. Going to be a bestseller or I don't know my books!!!!
328,Nineteen Minutes,0743496728,Jodi Picoult,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"This is a, WELL WRITTEN, story about cruelty and evil. Since it's about a school shooting, you'd assume the bad guy is the one with the guns. Think again.What the shooter does is unforgivable, killing 10 kids and hurting many more. But he acts more as a reaction to cruelty and evil than because he is naturally that way himself.Everyone has, at one time or another, felt like an outsider, like they don't belong. Peter Houghton is an oddball from the beginning, and school is a place where such kids are often tormented. In a series of searing vignettes, Peter is essentially tortured by other students. It reminded me of baby birds in the wild, who will sometimes peck weaker siblings to death.The final pages have the requisite Jodi Picoult surprise ending, which left me wanting to read high-schooler Josie's narrative. It's not there, so the reader is left to wonder what she is thinking.At first I was hesitant to read this book, because of the grim subject matter. Once I started, it was hard to put down. I wish the author had written more about the high school kids and less about the adults, but it's still a compelling read. I won't let my 9th-grader read it, because it has sex scenes way too raw, but it would be good for 12th-graders and older."
328,Nineteen Minutes,0743496728,Jodi Picoult,Barnes and Noble,4.4,TeensReadToo,"I always find it hard to read books dealing with school shootings, since I am the mother of two school-aged children. NINETEEN MINUTES, however, is an emotional story that should be required reading for teens, along with their watching of the movie REQUIEM FOR A DREAM. Reading this story of a bullied teen who finally has enough and takes out his anger on his high school is enlightening, and, at times, hard to read. I found it very easy to identify with many of the characters in the book: not just with the shooter, but with the judge's daughter, who wants only to fit in and be popular, and the jocks, who don't know how to be anything but what they are. NINETEEN MINUTES is a great book. I can honestly say I enjoyed it, even while crying my way through several passages. Read it -- whether a teen or the parent of a teenager, and find out what REALLY happens in high schools around the US -- and what could be happening, quite possibly, in your own hometown."
328,Nineteen Minutes,0743496728,Jodi Picoult,Barnes and Noble,4.4,XXXOOOBookwormOOOXXX,"At first glance, it looks like a straightforward act of revenge, but things are revealed to be more complex. One of his victims is Matt Royston, the boyfriend of his former childhood friend, Josie Cormier, and others are members of the in-crowd, but others have seemingly no relation. In the days before the trial, and in the days leading up to the shooting, we are given the backstory, told mostly from Josie's, Peter's, and their mothers' viewpoint. We learn of the incessant teasing this boy received, adults' unsuccessful attempts to help him fit in, and of the stormy relationship between Josie and Matt. During the trial, we hear from the victims who survived and the devastation the crime has wrought on their lives. In the end, the reader may still be undecided whether Peter is primarily a victim, perpetrator, loyal friend, or all three, but that is the point. Overall, this was a tragic story and worth the read, especially for high school and junior high students who might not recognize the long term effects of their everyday actions. I can't quite express what it is about this book that made it less than the sum of its parts, but I wasn't as impressed with the writing as I would have expected considering the topic. However, while this is not my favorite Picoult book, I admire Jodi's willingness to tackle contemporary, relevant, and highly charged themes with compassion.about a school shooting. It follows a handful of the people who are intimately involved with the shooting, through their lives: present and past, so you really find out the history behind who they are and why they are doing what they do. It is a very well developed story and in the end nothing is left for you to wonder about. Although it is 455 pages, it kept my attention throughout and just when you think you know exactly what's going to happen and think you have it all figured out, everything changes right up until a few pages before the end. I would definitely recommend this book for anyone who can handle reading the language of potty mouthed teenagers and the emotional struggles and violence of a school shooting. A tragic subject with very good writing."

330,"The Eye of the World (Wheel of Time, #1)",0812511816,Robert Jordan,Barnes and Noble,4.6,christian2795,"Some have criticized the late, great Robert Jordan for being overly detailed, unrealistic, and Tolkienesque. The raging popularity of George R.R. Martin has swayed fantasy fans and critics in favor of concision, gritty realism, and complexity. Clearly, that has worked for Martin, and props to him, but there are still a significant amount of us who enjoy a good dose of, well, fun in our fantasy novels. Yes, there is quite a bit of traveling. Yes, there are detailed descriptions of places and events, and detailed, somewhat repetitive descriptions of characters. Yes, a hefty chunk of this novel mirrors LOTR (which was Mr. Jordan's intention). But as one critic smartly put it, Tolkien's influence on fantasy literature (or LOTRature, as I like to call it, hee hee(: ) is so powerful that it is next to impossible to escape the foundations and rudimentary conventions that he laid down. In fact, one runs the risk of looking ridiculous if they really strain themselves trying to avoid following in Tolkien's well-traced footsteps. Robert Jordan, in full awareness, took Tolkien's model, beefed it up, and ran away with it over the course of the eleven novels that he lived to produce. The aspects of WOT that bug some people are utterly delightful to a different group of people (i.e. true fans and fantasy buffs, and not stuffy critics or champions of Martinesque realism). 

Now to the book. This is a long, absorbing, charming read. Rand al-Thor, who calls to memory Luke Skywalker, even if he is not nearly as revolutionary or distinctive, is an acceptable hero, as one honestly desires to watch him grow and mature as the story progresses. Characters like Mat, Perrin, Moiraine, Lan, Egwene, Nynaeve, and Loial all have agendas of their own, and so they are equally fascinating to watch. The story is simple, but charmingly told, and wonderfully evocative, so occasional long, slow stretches are not too terribly distracting. Finishing this book, and seeing the size and number of the other books gives one the wonderful feeling of being in for a long, cozy, and thrilling ride. The writing is great, and anyone who says otherwise is either nitpicking, or lamenting the absence of gratuitous sex scenes, bastards, tyrannical midgets, and graphic, gory battle sequences. Instead, one gets romance (real romance?? Imagine that!!), dashing heroes, dastardly villains, and exciting battles and skirmishes. If you cherish those things, then pick up this book and get lost in this world."
330,"The Eye of the World (Wheel of Time, #1)",0812511816,Robert Jordan,Barnes and Noble,4.6,HouseOfReads,"This series of books is one of my all-time go-to regular reads. What I really like about this world Robert Jordan (may the Light illumine him :) made is the women. Usually, fantasy books and hero journeys are Brave Young Men with ancillary women who nurture them, tempt them or occasionally heal and clean up after them. In this series, the women are heroines with equally thrilling arcs and journeys, too. Perfect series to start on vacation or snowbound weekend. Those of you who are re-readers like me, this series, beginning with this book, is a great addition to your stash. The cover art is silly, and I encourage you to ignore it."

At first i thought it would be just another boring book we had to read for school but as soon as i read the first page i was drawn in and could not put it down. I finished the book in one day even though my deadline to read was not for two weeks. I came in to school the next day and found that most of the class had finished it in one day as well and others were nearly finished as well. There was not a single person in the class of 26  who did not love the book. It made me laugh and cry, even a few of the guys in the class admitted to crying. It was a powerful story and i reccomend it to everyone."
331,The Pact,0061150142,Jodi Picoult,Barnes and Noble,4.3,TV_Tam,"After reading Nineteen Minutes, I picked up the Pact. I wanted an enthralling book, and that is what I got with the Pact. It did not offer  the same thrill ride I got with Nineteen minutes, but instead took a deep look into a non-traditional and even twisted relationship between two teenagers. The main characters, Chris and Emily, grew up side by side, becoming inseperable, almost like twins. But when their relationship evolves into something more, it abruptly ends with an apparent suicide pact that leaves one of them dead and one of them alive. Teenage relationships, depression, and suicide are all dissected with the fervor and grace that I've come to love from Jodi Picoult. This book explores the darker side of love:  What is love, and is it too much for some people to handle? What happens when such apparently deep love ends in death? And when it goes wrong, is there a way out? I found this book intriguing and disturbing all at once, and asked myself these very questions. And although the book came to a satisfying conclusion, I still don't know if I have any answers."

332,"The Magician's Nephew (Chronicles of Narnia, #6)",0060764902,C.S. Lewis,Barnes and Noble,4.3,carlosmock,"The Chronicles of Narnia is a series of seven fantasy novels for children written by C. S. Lewis. It is considered a classic of children's literature and is the author's best-known work, having sold over 120 million copies in 41 languages. Written by Lewis between 1949 and 1954 and illustrated by Pauline Baynes.

The books contain Christian ideas made easily accessible to young readers. They are not pedantic, however, and their richness of adventure, color, and ideas have made them favorites of children and adults, Christians and non-Christians. In addition to Christian themes, Lewis also borrows characters from Greek and Roman mythology as well as traditional British and Irish fairy tales.

Even though the Magician's nephew is the ""Sixth"" installment it should be read First.  

Completed in the winter of 1954 and published in 1955, the prequel The Magician's Nephew brings the reader back to the very beginning of Narnia where we learn how Aslan created the world and how evil first entered it. Digory Kirke and his friend Polly Plummer stumble into different worlds by experimenting with magic rings made by Digory's uncle (the titular ""magician""), encounter Jadis (The White Witch), and witness the creation of Narnia. Many long-standing questions about Narnia are answered in the adventure that follows.

Even though C. S. Lewis placed The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe as the first book in the series.  Older editions of the book reflect this decision. Lweis grandson laterr changed the order so that the books were in chronological order.  After all The Magicians Nephew is the story of how Narnia was created and correlates with the book of Genesis."

333,Still Alice,0595440096,Lisa Genova,Barnes and Noble,4.3,2866exile,"For anyone whose life has been touched by Alzheimer's disease (as so many have been, and many more will be), or for anyone who is approaching the far side of middle age, this book is at the same time clarifying and terrifying.  The author takes the perspective of the Alzheimer's patient herself, one which is frequently overlooked by more ""scholarly"" works on the topic, and changes the whole tone of her writing as well as the subjects portrayed, as the narrator progresses further into the grip of the disease.  She brings out many seldom-contemplated factors such as quality of life, support groups and counseling for the patient as well as the caregivers, and provides a gripping, touching, and horrifying sense of how it must be to feel yourself slipping away.  I highly recommend this book to anyone.  I have already passed around my advance copy and plan to buy several copies for family members and friends when it is released.  A must-read for caregivers, relatives, and persons in the early stages of Alzheimers, and a goldmine for book groups."
333,Still Alice,0595440096,Lisa Genova,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"Lisa Genova takes a subject that is so difficult to deal with and turns it into a time that all can learn from.  If you have ever had a parent or sibling die from this disease, you will find this book a must to understand what happens from the patient's perspective of this long good bye.   Lisa Genova takes the time to show how difficult it is for the patient as well as the family.  As a caretaker you sometimes forget that there is a person locked inside this disease that is unable to remember but can still function at some level.  Each stage is handled with care and openness, but will leave the reader asking questions about their own reactions if faced with such a situation.  No one is left out.  If you have not been confronted with this disease, you will gain a deeper understanding and appreciation for both the patient and caregivers through this piece of literature."

I think that the author depicted the progression of the disease very accurately as well as what happens to the family and friends that watch the person slowly but surely deteriorating no matter what the lifestyle or education of that person is.  It was a book that touched my emotions because of my personal experiences.  As I read the book, I sometimes found myself having to put it down because of my feelings....but moments later picking up the book to continue reading it.  A must read!!"
334,"Reflected in You (Crossfire, #2)",0425263916,Sylvia Day,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"Please hurry and release this book. This series is BETTER than 50 shades. I need my Gideon fix, lol"
334,"Reflected in You (Crossfire, #2)",0425263916,Sylvia Day,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Cimmaron,"To say that REFLECTED IN YOU was high in drama would be an understatement. The emotional highs and lows in this book made me want to reach for that bottle of TUMS and start popping them like Tic-Tacs. Eva and Gideon's relationship has been one major train wreck that I have not been able to tear myself away from. In essence, Eva and Gideon are two people who have no business in being in a relationship, especially with each other. But even when there are so many odds against them, Eva and Gideon fight tooth and nail to hold on to a love and relationship they're addicted to and desperately need.

Even with all the drama that unravels in this book, I still believe that Eva and Gideon really do belong to each other. Some say that two wrongs don't make a right but in Eva and Gideons case, they absolutely do. Yes, their relationship is dysfunctional and stressful but their undying love for each other is undeniable. As flawed as they are, their union only makes sense and honestly there aren't many people in the world who would be able to put up with all of their issues. As per the usual, Eva played the jealous and feisty girlfriend which only made me like her more. I give her props for wanting to claim her man and I really admired her for having balls of steel for confronting Gideon's mother, Corinne and Dr. Lucas. As for Gideon...well y'all already know how much I love this man but after reading Reflected in You my love for him even went deeper. He's protective, commanding, and over-bearing as ever and the depths he will go to for Eva will leave some of you quite shocked. Without giving away any spoilers, I was shocked to find out Sylvia Day took the path that she did with Gideon. I had my feelings about it and wouldn't have doubted it but HOT DANG, Miss Day went ""there"" and left me with my jaw dropped.

While REFLECTED IN YOU might leave you emotionally exhausted, the roller coaster ride that is Eva and Gideon's relationship is completely worth the pain and suffering. For a popular series like Crossfire with fans who are so engrossed with the characters, Sylvia Day definitely had her work cut out for her follow up to Bared to You. With Reflected in You as one of my mostly anticipated reads for 2012 I am more than happy to state that Sylvia Day more than delivered in this sequel. The emotional highs and lows, intense, passionate and explosive love scenes, and that jaw dropping ending are just a few reasons why this book is one of my favorites from this year (along with Bared to You, of course). If you were a fan of Bared to You, Reflected in You is definitely one book you'll want to get as soon as it hits shelves."

336,"1st to Die (Women's Murder Club, #1)",0446696617,James Patterson,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"Patterson catches us again with book in hand turning those pages as we did for his other thrillers. Patterson is able to create a suspenseful mood for the reader. What¿s better than a group of four woman to try and catch a psycho, killing newlywed couples. In my opinion, this book deserves 5 stars, for its intense suspense. Patterson is one of the few authors that is able to make you think you know what¿s happening and then your all wrong.	A person¿s wedding day is suppose to be the happiest day of their life. The time after, referred to as the ¿Honeymoon¿ is supposed to be enjoyable, fun, and romantic. In 1ST TO DIE., three couples find their wedding day and their honeymoon¿s to be a time of death.    	The book has four main characters, who Patterson points out within the first few chapters. The most notable being Lindsay Boxer, an inspector for the San Francisco Police Department. Along with Lindsay the characters who want to solve the case include Claire Washburn a medical examiner and Lindsay¿s best friend, Jill Bernhardt an assistant District Attorney assigned to the first case, and Cindy Thomas a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle, who integrates herself into the group after the first murders. Together, these women form ¿The Women¿s Murder Club¿ and take you on a ride of suspense as they work together to find the monster responsible for a series of tragic honeymoon murders that began with the intense killing of David and Melanie Brandt.  	Patterson is able to make these books enjoyable for even the High School student. He has this ability to make you pick up the book and never put it down. Make sure that if you purchase this book you also purchase the second and third books as well. The thing with Patterson is that once you read one in a series you have to read the rest.   	James Patterson writes in a short and casual manner.  His chapters are short and to the point, which makes you keep turning the page to find out what will happen next.  The characters are very well described, which makes you feel like you know them personally. When something bad happens you feel as if the tragedy has happened to one of your friends or family members.   	James Patterson truly is one of the most amazing authors, his clever twists and fast pace keep the reader going. It¿s almost as if Patterson knows what you are afraid of and he reaches the point that you jump out of your seat. If you truly enjoy this novel, you would also like Along Came A Spider, Kiss The Girls, Jack And Jill, Cat & Mouse, Pop Goes The Weasel, and Roses Are Red.    -Nick Trodella"

337,The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,0345453743,Douglas Adams,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Guest,"I discovered HGTTG years ago and loved it. I recently found the five-part trilogy bound in one volume, and decided to re-read what I thought had been the best send-up of science fiction ever written.         I was right. Beginning with an unlikely starship crew consisting of a two-headed, fugitive Galactic President, a burned-out travel writer, a paranoid android, (who parks cars for 5 billion years while waiting to be rescued) a mysterious beauty, and the last survivor of the late planet Earth, (which was destroyed to make way for a galactic freeway) Douglas Adams has managed to incorporate every science fiction cliche known to man or Vogon. However, unlike most writers of SF, he does not take himself or his subject too seriously. The result is a universe of marvelous silliness and deliciously ditzy characters who zoom along on their improbability drive, carrying their towels, drinking Pan Galactic Gargleblasters, while trying to avoid having a Vogon poetry read at them, or meeting up with the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal.     My suggestion? Buy the book, lock yourself in your room, and read it--preferably on the floor, because that's where you'll end up anyway--unless you're the type who still thinks digital watches are pretty neat things."

I was awe-struck as the credits were rolling up.  Now that was a great story and even better presentation.  I was really excited to get the book to find out the whole story.  If you read this you must read the foreword and the introduction first.  You have to realize that the film was just an adaptation of the 'real story'.  I immediately fell in love with the writing style of Douglas Adams.  You really do need a good sense of humor to get through it, because it is laugh after laugh but in the style of Douglas Adams.  There is also romance, action, and great characters."

The book opens with Emma and Dexter on July 15, 1988, the last day of University in Edinburgh. She is a brain child, he is privileged and spoiled rotten. They are attracted to each other but it is the last day, and they are headed in different directions. Their story then proceeds in yearly episodes, only taking place on July 15, from 1988 through 2007. The author sticks to this original order of things, filling in background as needed. Emma and Dexter remain friends, although each has separate romantic entanglements, or lack of them, and their careers take quite different courses.

340,"I Am Number Four (Lorien Legacies, #1)",0061969559,Pittacus Lore,Barnes and Noble,4.4,EdmundDantes,"1st - I bought this book when I saw the preview for the movie. 2nd - I am not a lover of stories about teenagers. That said, I really enjoyed I Am Number Four. It had my sci-fi element, my good versus evil, and a few elements of surprise. The older, my cynical side of me thinks it could have kept the teen love aspect. It just made it seem like the boook was written specifically to be turned into a movie. Unintentional snobishness aside, I was pleasantly surprised at the way the story had me from the go. Was it the most involved, moving writing I have ever seen? Nope, but it didn't need it. I appreciated the story first and foremost and quickly got over the fact that Isaac Asinov didn't write it. I found myself moved in parts and speeding through pages in my Nook, trying to find out what happened next. This is obviously a part of a series, and I'm anxious for the next Chapter. There are many secrets to uncover. Grab this for a quick read on an airplane or a lazy Sunday."

341,The Iliad,0140275363,"Homer, Robert Fagles, Fr??d??ric Mugler, Bernard Knox",Barnes and Noble,4,Tiger_Holland,"""Achilles doesn't gladly suffer fools,
and Agamemnon's foolishness is shown
when he takes away Briseis and rules
proudly, claiming war prizes for his own
which should, by rights, belong to other men
(the slavery issue never gets addressed)
but this king of all the Greeks is brought low when
Achilles boycotts battle. Since their best
and boldest fighter's sitting out, the Greeks
are getting hacked to bits by Hector, who's
just fighting for his home, but then Zeus speaks, 
and brings down Trojan doom: they're going to lose.
The Greeks march ahead with inexorable forces
and Troy buries Hector, the breaker of horses.""

Here we have the story of the fall of Troy at the hands of the Greeks, though The Iliad actually ends before the fall of Troy, the Trojan Horse comes along in a later book, The Odyssey, and the Greeks are usually called Achaeans or Argives (I think what they're called at any given point has something to do with Homer's metrics and how many syllables his lines needed). The half-god warrior Achilles is the central figure of the story and the action is driven as much by his decisions as it is by the whims of the gods, who take sides in the war and vigorously defend their favorite champions. Achilles meets his opposite in Hector, prince of Troy, who is a family man fighting to defend his own home city, while Achilles is in it for the glory and is fighting for a man he hates. Hector kills Achilles' friend Patroclus, Achilles kills Hector in retaliation, and the war-cycle spirals downward and gets uglier with each passing skirmish.

Some themes:

Rage: The Iliad is called the epic of menis, rage, the first chapter is titled ""The Wrath of Achilles,"" and the first (and best) line in the whole epic is, ""Rage-Goddess, sing the rage of Peleus' son Achilles."" This killing-anger isn't something the characters can escape from for any length of time. Rage can be hidden, but it always eventually bursts forth again--Achilles even nurtures the feeling. He's furious and refuses to fight for the Achaeans, and then when they bring him presents to appease him, he ain't want to be appeased! Cooler heads don't seem to prevail, here, and the epidemic of rage ensures that The Iliad is endlessly violent and gory--except for Hector's body, which is preserved from decay by the gods, the other casualties of war either get thrown onto pyres or become food for the vultures.

Vengeance. An eye for an eye, ad infinitum. Humans love seeking vengeance, like Achilles avenging Patroclus by killing Hector, but the gods are fond of it, too. The gods are big on damage control--they might not be able to stop you from doing something disastrous, but they'll certainly punish you for it after the fact, like Apollo visiting the Achaeans with a plague after they kidnap Chryseis, the daughter of his priest.

Doom. Not just fate, but negative fate. Doom hangs over all of Troy and over most of the Achaens that the reader might actually care about: though Achilles is a killing machine, it's possible to empathize with him, and the propheices make it clear that he's going to die at Troy; Odysseus is going to live through the war, but it'll be another long decade before he gets home; Agamemnon is going to be murdered by his wife's boyfriend when he gets home (but since he's a power-hungry tyrant who killed his own daughter, it's not such a loss), and Menelaus is going to regain Helen and go home, but you can't say they'll live at all h"

342,The Casual Vacancy,0316228532,J.K. Rowling,Barnes and Noble,3.1,eire11,"I see a lot of readers giving this a book a bad review because of the language the writer used.  They believe she does this to make a profit.  These readers a totally missing the point.  This writer doesn't need the money.  She has made a fortune off of the Harry Potter series.  She is now free to write about something for herself.  She is giving you a glimpse into the world she has experienced growing up and into her adulthood.  She doesn't care what the critics think; this book is for her.  She shares the pain, anger, frustration, cynicism, sadness, and hopelessness, of the past she has experienced and risen above. I suspect it to be cathartic for her. It has made her the determined, driven person she is.  Positive outcomes can come from negative experiences. Yeah for you J.K, you did it!"
342,The Casual Vacancy,0316228532,J.K. Rowling,Barnes and Noble,3.1,Anonymous,"To bind J.K. Rowling to her success as the author of the Harry Potter series severely restricts opinion of this subsequent work. Opening this book and expecting a magical work of art similar to what she was able to create with Potter is like searching for the toy in the cereal because it was advertised on the box. Seeing Rowley's name printed on the cover no longer indicates wands and wizards. Readers of this particular novel must understand that before reading the first few pages. Rowling proves, brilliantly, that she is not just a children's author.

  The Casual Vacancy pulls the reader into the lives and homes of a small English town in the midst of underlying political and personal turmoil. There are quite a few characters to keep up with, but they are each presented in a way that the reader shouldn't have much difficulty recalling them through the early stages of the book. The lives of these characters, along with particular delayed revelations about their pasts, allows for rich development. Nearly every character is presented as both protagonist and antagonist at some point within the pages.

  Many readers will undoubtedly notice that Rowling gives light to certain problems within today's society. These problems revolve around her character's lives and affect them in ways that drive the novel through to the end.

  The most interesting aspect of this novel, and possibly the most shocking to Potter fans, is Rowling's use of language. Both dialect and word choice are raw and true to the characters they come from. Rowling also presents a clear distinction between what characters say and what they think - allowing for variables within their lives and their interactions with others.

I highly recommend this novel as both an involving read as well as a wonderful example of modern/contemporary literature."

Or befriended a paraplegic, mainly for the &ldquo;credit&rdquo; others gave you for being such a good person?  Maybe spent a week at a nudist camp trying to figure out  why the most important requirement was to bring lots of towels?

 &rdquo;Naked&rdquo; by David Sedaris is a hilarious memoir of the author&rsquo;s life.  Sedaris finds humor in his faults, his family, and the strange situations that he encounters.  Unlike some other popular memoirs, &ldquo;Naked&rdquo; is very well written and easy to enjoy.  Each essay (as his chapters are called) is short, humorous, and enjoyable, and gives you an idea of what Sedaris&rsquo;s life has been like.

I highly recommend &ldquo;Naked&rdquo; by David Sedaris.  This is a quick read and well worth it!

I loved Eragon, and I'm glad Eldest didn't let me down. I wish they'd continue producing the movies. The Eragon movie is what got me to read the books in the first place. Chris Paolini is an incredible writer! I still can't believe these monstrous books, with their incredible characters, languages, lands, and creatures was created by a guy younger than me! I don't usually read these sorts of books, but I'm glad I did. It's been a nice change of pace in terms of reading material, and it's been an awesome adventure."

346,"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Oz, #1)",0140621679,"L. Frank Baum, W.W. Denslow",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"Since I was a child, my favorite movie has always been The Wizard of Oz.  I can remember having the entire collection of plastic Oz characters, a Wizard of Oz lunch box, sleeping bag, and of course the famous back pack.  I dressed up as Dorothy at least twice for Halloween and forced my dog along the way acting as Toto.  But something I had never realized was that I never read the book.  Recently comming across the opportunity to do so, I find the book just as amazing as the movie--if not better.    Although I couldn't seem to get the image of Judy Garland out of my mind, I found that Dorothy is more adventureous than ever in Baum's novel.  By reading The Wizard of Oz readers find out that the Land of Oz is even more fantastic than portrayed in the film version.  Dorothy and company befriend a Queen of Mice, a China Princess, and even the King of the Flying Monkeys.      Reading Baum's novel made me realize the wonders of being a child and visioning the fantastic voyage of Dorothy; however, the novel also made me realize that The Wizard of Oz is not only for children, but for adults as well.  Reading this novel gives adults a chace to escape from the chaos of everyday life and enter a world full of wonder and excitement (not to mention the chance to revisit childhood).  Baum's novel reminds us the of meaning of friendship, courage, love, and most of all that 'there is no place like home.'    I recommend readers of all ages to revisit this timeless classic and enter into the Wonderful World of Oz."

I thought it was the greatest thing ever. Then I read the book when I was seven, I had just discovered it in my Grandfather's attic, and I decided that the book was by far superior. The story was longer, there was backstory, and it didn't have the weak, 'It was all a dream' ending, which I had always found disappointing. My love of the book was reaffirmed last year in my U. S. History class when the allegory of the novel was discussed in a featured essay, relating it to the argument between the gold and silver standard of the late 1800s. I highly recommend this book to anyone, but especially children with imaginations that need space to grow."

Lewis, Lucy, Edmund, Peter, and Susan accidentally arrive back in Narnia. They come across a dwarf, Trumpkin, who works for Caspian (nephew of Miraz). Caspian's tutor, Doctor Cornelius, helps him escape into the wilderness of Narnia. King Miraz furiously searched for Caspian. Meanwhile, Caspian had sent Trumkin out to search for the kings of Narnia (Lucy, Edmund, Peter, and Susan). As they make their way to Caspian, they get lost. Lucy sees Aslan, who says that the Detour was his fault and that they should follow him. The two girls and boys split up and go separate ways. The boys find Caspian and Miraz arguing. This is when Peter steps in and fights Miraz. The very next day, Aslan creates a doorway for them to go through to go back to England. They soon arrive in the railway station like nothing had ever happened. There are many positives from this book. I like how one year goes by in our time when hundreds go by in narnian time. This book may seem very long, but if you really enjoy it, it will fly by. The book has some negatives in it too. I like how C.S. is telling two stories in the beginning (The kings and Caspian). Some of the words are very hard to understand. The book can get boring and long. C.S. Lewis writes in an expository manner by using descriptive words and explaining things that are hard to understand. She writes with many many details. If you like adventure and battles, this book is for you. The book flies by making you want to read other books in this series. There are many other books by C.S. Lewis such as the following: The ""Chronicles of Narnia"", Yours, Jack, Words to Live By, Mere Christianity, Space Trilogy, The Great Divorce: A Dream, and many more."

I received an advance reader edition of this book from Random House Children's Publishing and Net Galley for the purpose of providing an honest review.

4.5 Stars

STOP!  Quit reading reviews about this book!  The only productive thing anyone is going to be able to tell you about this book is that you need to read it.  If anyone tries to tell you anything else, do not let them.  No good can come from knowing anything about this book.  Your friends who wish to tell you about the book are really just ruining it for you.

If you are in public and hear people discussing this book, the best thing to do would be to cover your ears and sing Mary Had a Little Lamb at the top of your lungs so that you cannot hear what is being discussed.  One minor flaw in that plan would be that new discussions may start about the crazy person singing nursery rhymes at the top of their lungs in public for no apparent reason.  Maybe this is not a good plan.  

If you have read the book, zip it.  Your friends deserve the same chance that you had.  Allow them the privilege of going into this book blindly.   I know that we all like to prepare our friends for what is ahead.  In this case, don&rsquo;t do it&hellip;.you are not helping!  

If you feel that you MUST discuss this book, here is what you can do.  Buy extra copies of the book and give them to your friends.  Wait until your friends have read the book.  Then and only then discuss the book (but not in a public area so that we can avoid the whole singing episode previously mentioned).  It will be fun.  It will be like when you were little and played school&hellip;and this time you get to be the teacher because you will be handing out the assignments.

I must say that I did figure out the big twist in the book about half way through but I had to find out that I was right so I kept reading and enjoyed the journey.  If I had known that I was right, it seriously would have ruined all of the fun.

Seriously?  Can nobody follow directions anymore?  Why are you still reading this review?  Stop&hellip;just stop and go read the book."
348,We Were Liars,0000000000,E. Lockhart,Barnes and Noble,4.2,BlondeLibrarian,"Beautiful. Privileged. Damaged. Liars

So I'm guessing that you have read quite a few reviews of this book now - and most of them don't really tell you much right? Everyone is keeping all hush hush and saying 'just read it!!!'

I have to be annoying....this review is pretty much more of the same. I'm not going to tell you many things about We Were Liars by E. Lockhart. But PLEASE believe me when I say that it's in YOUR best interests (I'll explain that point in a moment). I WILL NOT SPOIL THIS BOOK FOR YOU! I REFUSE!

Okay...so let's see what I can say...

The Sinclairs are a beautiful family. They spend their summers on a beautiful island, in beautiful houses with their beautiful children. Something happens, and everything changes. We don't know what happens, or why everything changes. We spend this book finding out. 

 There...I think I did well yes? Honestly, I really do understand why nobody says much about this book. I think you need to go into this knowing as little as possible - here is my proven experience with this....

I am obviously a book-lover. I blog about books, I read lots of reviews and watch lots of Booktube. I take part in alot of bookish discussions and get involved in the community. Obviously I had heard the hype surrounding We Were Liars (and in all honesty, yes - that is why I picked it up). I had heard about how insane this oh-so-secret ending is, and I was very excited. For this reason, I instantly turned into Hercule Poirot from the moment I opened this book. I was looking for clues to things that hadn't even happened yet, I read WAY too much into things, and concocted a theory that I was convinced was correct. My theory was  very shocking, very disturbing - and as it turned out - very wrong. When the truth of We Were Liars is actually revealed, I found it less shocking than the craziness I conjured in my head...and so I was slightly underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong - I was shocked, I wasn't expecting it - but my theory was more intense. The fact that I knew so much about this book going in meant that I actually ruined the experience for myself a little. 

 Now, my stepmum Sam is also a keen reader. She doesn't blog, she probably rarely reads reviews. If a book takes her fancy, she just reads it. She purchased We Were Liars on her Kindle because it was on sale. She knew nothing about it, and dived into the unknown. Sam absolutely LOVED this book! She was blown away and had a much better experience than I did. 

So you see - when everyone is frustratingly holding back the dirty details - they are doing you a favour! Just read this....and do so with an open mind :) I didn't enjoy this as much as I was expecting to. I mentioned the ending being a bit underwhelming for me (but that was my own fault so it doesn't count). I also found it a tad on the slow side - but please do stick with it. It's not a long book, and it picks up - you need to read to the end. I can't give this full marks as it didn't blow my mind like I wanted it to, but it was beautifully written, poignant and did touch me deeply, so I'm giving it a good rating :) I did enjoy this book. I'm glad I read it and I do recommend it to anyone who wants to solve a mystery and have their emotions played with."

I have had a moment to think about what to say and there just aren't any words that I can come up with that do this book justice. To me it was real and deep, something that the young adult genre lacks a lot of. E. Lockhart has a beautiful, mesmorizing way with words. There were several passages through out this book that I highlighted not only because I wanted to share them with you but because I wanted to be able to look back and read them again and again and expierence the raw emotion that this book brought out of me. I decided that I will not share any of my favorite quotes or passages in this review like I had first intended. I am going to ask that you read this piece of art work for yourself because that is exactly what it is... ART! This is not a book you want to hear all about from someone else.

It offers a plethora of horror,   suspense, and almost non-stop action.  It was the first   book that actually scared me in any substantial way and   made me sleep with the lights on.  One night while I was   reading it, I had my window open and I actually closed it   because I was so scared.   I have read Dracula by Bram   Stoker, the original Vampire story, and in my opinion, this   book is better.  It started off a little slow but didn't take   too long to get exciting and once that happened, the   suspense and action kept on coming throughout the   entire book."

There were nights where I would stay up until three in the morning reading and have to shove it under my mattress before turning the lights out.  I thought that my life would never be the same again after reading this hahaha!  King has a gift of building up this intense level of suspense and it's not until the last quarter of the novel where the climax actually happens.  My friend would ask me what the heck was so scary and I had a hard time putting it into words, it just was!  Such a great classic! I am so in love with this book even though I still turn on all of the lights in my house!"
349,Salem's Lot,0450031063,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Enchantress0fTales,"Stephen King seems to have a knack for making something so traditional and so (nowadays) cliche and making it so freaking amazing. It took me a long time to read the novel only because I have a social life and school. However, while I was reading it, I was automatically sucked in. My teachers had to literally force my attention back to the board or textbook. It doesn't take but one page to suck you in. After you get going, you don't even need the lights off to get the creeps or shivers. It's that natural talent that I envy that Mr. King has. Vampires have never seemed so real to me."
350,Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,0679785892,"Hunter S. Thompson, Ralph Steadman",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Billy0,"One book that contains everything about freedom and chasing a dream metaphorically. Fear and loathing in las vegas contains excitement, extreme drug use, and a baseline for the &quot;American Dream&quot; Not only did the plot story strongly interest the reader, but the metaphoric ending contains truth and revelation."
350,Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,0679785892,"Hunter S. Thompson, Ralph Steadman",Barnes and Noble,4.5,S_Duke,"... read the book. There are parts in here that were not put on the screen, and you get to be inside the head of R Duke. What better way to spend a few hours than to dance around the streets of Vegas while tripping your *** off. And besides, who better to tell the tale than Hunter? He has a wonderful way with words, and the scenes he paints jump off the page with vibrant color. 

Again, read this book even if you've seen the movie. It's a better ride. Just bring some golf shoes!"
350,Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,0679785892,"Hunter S. Thompson, Ralph Steadman",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"This is the book that 'defined a generation', as many have put it.  and after reading it i only wish i could have been there to experience the time Thompson is talking about.  this piece of literature shows and describes everything you want to know about the dope decade in utter extravagance and is a shear testimony to the power of literature.  the words are as precise and impenetrable as you could ever find and the ideas set forth provoke visions in the reader's mind that transcend anything that could be told to you by some one who was actually there.  i'm not sure if i read a book or 204 pages of a man proving that you can talk about a psychedelic drug trip in a way that makes the reader feel like they are having the trip, themselves.  this book dedicates itself to the idea and conviction that people can still write incredibly well and forces the reader to not only think about the time the literature is speaking of, but also their time and what they will do with it.  'Just another freak in the freak kingdom.'  Thompson not only certifies this as true but also proves to the audience that he is not just a freak, but another genius in the realm of the written word and that nothing can take that reputation away from a person."
351,"Clockwork Prince (The Infernal Devices, #2)",1416975888,Cassandra Clare,Barnes and Noble,4.7,YA-Sisterhood,"You know that feeling of finally returning home after you have been on a trip for several days?  The type of trip that ends with a long drive, and those last few hours of highway seem to keep multiplying.  From the moment I cracked open this book, that was the feeling I was overwhelmed with.  I felt like I had come home again after a long journey.  Most people that know me, know that I love Cassandra Clare (and Jace), and love might be too weak of a word!  Something about her writing calls to me, and just clicks with my personality.  She has gone far beyond my expectations with Clockwork Prince.  As I say above, it is stunningly perfect!!!

At the end of Clockwork Angel, we were left with many questions.  My main question was, what the heck is going on with Will?  I wanted to love him him in CA, then he would do something that made me question whether I had judged him correctly!  I like my boys broken, and they don't come anymore broken than Mr. Herondale.  To my abiding joy, Cassie answers those questions in CP, and not on the last page of the novel!  It was wonderful to have those answers almost immediately.  It seems to be a mighty feat to be able to produce a successful 2nd novel in a series.  Many times we don't find out enough information, and its basically just a huge setup for the finale.  Clockwork Prince is not that way in the least.  I was overjoyed by how many questions we actually got answered.

Another unique quality of Cassie's writing is her ability to build a character.  Her novels are all in 3rd person and are deeply character driven.  Every character is distinctly different, and they seem to come to life right before your eyes.  After reading this, I feel like I genuinely know and have a substantial insight into what makes each character tick. (ha!)  We find out more about every single character, and even get to see a different side of Magnus that makes me only love him more.  The insights don't stop with the characters either.  So much more of the Shadowhunter world is revealed especially what all encompasses a parabatai relationship.  I can't wait to go back and read all the other novels in light of this new knowledge!

I know that Cassie promised a Dirty Sexy Balcony Scene, but just let me say there is so much more where that came from!  If you like the kissing (from both boys), you will be bursting with giddiness through this book!!!  I will also say, hands down, that this is the best love triangle that exists in written words to date!  I am so utterly torn.  One moment I want her to be with Will because of his emotional brokenness, and the next moment I'm routing for Jem because of his physical brokenness.  All three of them deserve to be happy, but I'm worried our hearts and theirs will be broken either way!  Its ripping my heart out! 

Through the pages, I experienced the entire gamut of emotions.  I laughed, cried, loved and was terrified at moments.  I love novels that make me feel and boy did I get exactly what I wanted!  After it was all over, I couldn't stop crying!  Ms. Clare gives us exactly what we all want in the novel, but just puts her classic spin on it!  I am simultaneously overjoyed and aggrieved at the same time!  Its a beautiful book, full of everything that encompasses wonderful in a novel.  It is honestly one of the best books I have ever read!!!"

352,Yes Please,0062268341,Amy Poehler,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"Really funny book throughout, and very interesting too. Amy Poehler gives a comedic narrative on her fantastic life so far which had me cracking up the whole time!!

Any fan should read this book!! 5 stars *****"
352,Yes Please,0062268341,Amy Poehler,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Sandy5,"I wanted to read Amy&rsquo;s book when I first found out she was going to write it.  I loved her on SNL; she always brought a smile on my face no matter what she was doing.   There&rsquo;s plenty to read inside this book and this book is heavy! I mean in weight, I was surprised how heavy it was but after looking inside with the nice glossy thick pages, no wonder it weighs what it does.  It wasn&rsquo;t all laughs and giggles inside but I did learn more about Amy than I ever thought I would. She talks about her beginning years as a stand-up comic, how she was trying to find her niche and how she made all the friends and connections over the years.  She was one determined person as she knew that her dreams would most likely become her reality, I found that remarkable about her. Her ability to add fun and humor to life shows in her book as she writes about her life and the things that made her who she is today.  I think I found the most enjoyment, had the most laughs with and found the most entertaining in the book the following:  
1. Her Christmas story with her brother Greg when they were younger- why did I never think of this?
2. Her list of divorce books. Being divorced I could totally relate to #5 God is the Details!
3. Her exposure to drugs and alcohol.  We all have some stories in the closet to tell but she adds some personal and serious notes too. 
4. Her many topics on her children - (we all love our own and we all could write a book but we don&rsquo;t so we&rsquo;ll let Amy expose all her funny and juicy stories)
5. Sex advice &ndash; I had to read them out loud and I read the Gentlemen Rules to husband (he needed to know)
6. Travel Section &ndash; I&rsquo;ve thought about this but not to this extent. Amy says we time travel with people, things and places. How something now will connect to the future or connected to the past via people, things or places but you have to be present (aware) to witness it or you won&rsquo;t see it. Amy believes the more she time travels, the more she realizes she&rsquo;s right where she needs to be."
352,Yes Please,0062268341,Amy Poehler,Barnes and Noble,3.9,DebSimon,"I'm going against the tide. The Prelude was one of the funnies things I've ever read, then the book took a crash and burn. Amy had other people write chapters, the rest just dragged on about mistakes she's made &amp; lessons learned. Although currently ranked #1 as a Humorous Autobiography this book is NOT funny and written specifically for Amy Poehler groupies. I read the first 100 pages and scanned the next 50 before slamming it shut. Conclusion: Unless you are a diehard Amy Poehler trivia junkie skip this one. The only thing I found moderately interesting was some of the behind the scenes SNL stuff."
353,Othello,0743477553,William Shakespeare,Barnes and Noble,4.2,JohnLemon,"This review is not of Othello itself (which is tremendously good), but rather on this edition of Othello (ISBN: 9781411400399), which was edited by Daniel Vitkus and David Scott Kastan. 

I read a lot of heavily annotated books, and I have to say that the Barnes & Noble Shakespeare editions have one of the best book designs I've ever encountered. The various references materials (footnotes and definitions for archaic words) appear in a manner that makes the text very easy to follow.

The scholarship is also top-notch. The annotations give you enough to make things clear without insulting your intelligence, or without overburdening you with unnecessary detail. The essays are also interesting and informative.

I've been avoiding Shakespeare ever since high school, which was many years ago. Now that I'm reading him again, I'm glad I'm in such good hands. It is making the experience a joy, rather than a chore.

My compliments to the editors and the book designer. They have done a superior job of making this difficult text accessible to the modern reader. Highly recommended."
353,Othello,0743477553,William Shakespeare,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"Why give samples of books if the sample is only the introduction or publishers notes? It gives no sample of the actual story itself, so you have no way of knowing how the story is written to see if you understand it. Very annoying."
353,Othello,0743477553,William Shakespeare,Barnes and Noble,4.2,msliblady,"The story of Othello is one of Shakespeare's best: Iago is the ultimate antagonist you love to hate. On the one hand, it is fascinating to watch him plot, scheme and set his traps. On the other, you are appalled at how quickly Othello turns on his new wife, just on the word of Iago. Shakespeare is the master! The Folger edition is also a classic. These are the editions I bought as a student, and now that I'm teaching Shakespeare, I was delighted that this was the edition my students requested. The edition combines the Folio version and the Quarto version, indicating those words unique to one version. My (middle school) students enjoy the plot summaries at the beginning of each scene and the definitions of unfamiliar words on the left hand page. Definitely a book to keep in your library."
354,Beloved,1400033411,Toni Morrison,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"A child is a gift which cannot be compared to any in the world, but when a child is murdered for the mother's survival, its spirit lingers on in the thoughts and nightmares of the family. Beloved by Toni Morrison is a haunting novel of a mother and daughter, their struggles to survive the shadows of their past, and the secrets that hold them back in irrefutable ways. The deeply troubled main characters and bone chilling plot takes place in a haunting setting which keeps the pages turning and the reader wanting more, even after the novel has ended. MOrrison wrote this novel with spellbounding emotion that can hadrdly be compared to any work of fiction I have ever read. Morrison's brilliant masterpiece transposes the mind of the reader into the time of the Civil War, where escaped slaves are continuously disturbed by their precedent."
354,Beloved,1400033411,Toni Morrison,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"There's a good reason this book won the Pulitzer Prize and is voted the #1 Work of Fiction in the last 25 Years!  Amazing book and a must read!I didn't find it confusing - but it was deep and required you to sit with it sometimes to absorb it - which also seemed to me, intentional by the writer.  I loved that about it. I saw some say it had nothing to do with slavery and I can only tell you that it has everything to do with slavery.  It has to do with it's mental and physical abuse and the effects of it.  All of this book is about is slavery.  One more thing I HAVE to say... One reviewer said she, Sethe, did what she did to Beloved for her own survival.  ...but that's not why she did it... she did it out of love for the child."
354,Beloved,1400033411,Toni Morrison,Barnes and Noble,4,DeDeFlowers,"I was very apprehensive about reading Beloved. I heard nothing but bad things about it from the people I know. So I went into it with a bad attitude. After reading the first couple chapters I understood Toni's writing style and was able to really get into it. I was never bored and I was able to put myself in the story. During one chapter I was literally breathless when it ended! It was that real. Parts of this novel are creepy, and I think that is what makes it so unique. You will feel many emotions while reading. It's a feeling that doesn't happen very much. I do have to say, I think people who know a lot about slavery will get more out of this, as it is a book about slavery. A couple things that were mentioned confused me and I had to look them up. I think this is a great book that you should not hesitate to pick up. It is extremely unique and will keep you reading!"
355,"Graceling (Graceling Realm, #1)",015206396X,Kristin Cashore,Barnes and Noble,4.5,SabH-CrystalReviews,"How can I even begin to review this book? How could I get you to trust me and read it, for it is one of the best book I've ever read? I can think of only one way: Must Read. I speak as I read. I'm happy. I'm sad. I'm scared. I'm relieved. I'm shocked. I'm waiting. Yes, all this while reading. Fiction, action, romance, friendship, fantasy, love, coping, dealing, Kings, Queens, evil, kindness, villain, killing... What else can you ask for in a book?

The writing was excellent, astonishing. The plot was full of magic and emotions. The characters, oh, the characters; they were unforgettable and brilliant. I can not even pick a character a loved the most. They all were above marvelous. I love Po and Katsa obviously, but the rest were equally amazing. I do love Po! Did I say that already?

I could not have imagined a better cover either, I loved the color, the effects and the eyes! The beginning, the ending and the story were all amazing. How she came up with all this, I have no idea. Needless to say, that whatever your reading preferences are, you have to read this book. I highly recommend it."
355,"Graceling (Graceling Realm, #1)",015206396X,Kristin Cashore,Barnes and Noble,4.5,BANCHEE_READS,"Our heroine, Katsa, is blessed, or cursed at times in her opinion, with a grace. In Katsa's world, a grace is a sort of innate ability that certain people are born with. Graces can be as simple as being able to play the flute really well, or as powerful as being able to read minds. Katsa's grace just happens to be killing, and as such, is exploited by her Uncle, the king, to preserve his own power and ensure that his demands are met. Katsa's role as royal enforcer often leaves her troubled, and somewhat afraid of her own powers. Deep down, Katsa is also lonely, although she doesn't realize it. That is, until she meets Po, a prince with a powerful fighting grace that seems to rival her own. As Katsa learns more about Po, and his mysterious grace, she also learns more about herself and finds the freedom to choose her own path.
This book was pure fun. The story had plenty of action, beginning even from the first page, and I found Katsa to be a complex but likeable character. The romance was sweet, without being overly sappy, although I did find Katsa's negative views of marriage as somewhat puzzling. This may sound strange, but I also really enjoyed the antagonist in the novel. We don't actually see much of his character, but his grace was just so sneaky! Cashore kept me guessing to the end as to how or if he would be ultimately defeated. I am glad that I gave this book a try and I plan on reading Fire, Cashore's soon to be released second novel."
355,"Graceling (Graceling Realm, #1)",015206396X,Kristin Cashore,Barnes and Noble,4.5,SeeMichelleRead,"In all the Seven Kingdoms no is feared or revered as much as Gracelings -- individuals who are born with an innate talent to do something extremely well, be it to sing perfectly, outrun a horse, or even to read minds. Gracelings are immediately discerned by their different colored eyes, often to their disadvantage since most people distrust and even dislike them. Katsa is born with one green and one blue eye but has no idea what her grace is until after her seventh birthday, when she accidentally killed a man. With the unlikely grace of killing Katsa is turned into her uncle's (King Randa) personal thug and enforcer - sending Katsa off on missions to 'punish' his vassals through pain, torture or even death. For herself, Katsa views her grace as a burden -- more often than not seeing herself as a monster. That is until she begins planning and executing her own secret missions with the help of her friends to combat the oppressive reigns of various rulers. One such mission to rescue the kidnapped grandfather of another ruler doesn't go exactly as planned when Katsa encounters another Graceling almost as talented in fighting as she is. A Graceling who will challenge every belief Katsa holds about the world around her and herself.

Boy, oh boy, Katsa kicks butt. Really. She's not happy unless she's taking out an entire battalion of bad guys. She doesn't feel feminine (she even cuts off all her hair - I can totally sympathize!) but she still possesses this incredibly soft inner self which is slowly uncovered as she opens herself up to others. In her struggle to define, and perhaps more importantly, learn to control her Grace, Katsa strives to find the courage to take control of her own life. This fast-paced book practically flew by but still took the time to address even minor characters which left me feeling satisfied and thoroughly engaged throughout. Graceling is an adventure story, a fantasy, a mystery, a political suspense, a romance -- it has it all and doesn't stop for a second. I found myself thinking about Katsa long afterwards because by golly, how fun would it be to be able to KNOW you could take down anybody, I mean anybody, before they even noticed you had two different colored eyes?"

Nothing but the faded gilt words of the title on the front. I vaguely remembered that there was a movie made about it, but I had no idea what the story was about. Little did I know, it turned out to be a deeply moving coming-of-age story, on par with The Catcher in the Rye and The Wars. It's the story of a twenty-year-old soldier, not much more than a boy, who struggles between his duty as a soldier and his own value for life, regardless of which side of the trenches it comes from. The novel is quietly poignant and at times devastating, with moments of beauty and horror that could only have been told by someone as an actual witness of that war. A true classic."

It brings out every feeling in you and is a very good choice for a required reading, (if you're a teacher).

358,"Oh, The Places You'll Go!",0679805273,Dr. Seuss,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Book_Lover89,"This book is a great gift for some graduates.

The one who will be receiving it from me has lead a somewhat bumpy and hard life so far.  he has fallen off of the tracks a few times and lost he way.  With some recent help, he has found his way back into the race of life and is actually graduating a year early from HS.

My graduate takes gifts like these to heart and I know he will remember this one for years to come.  Dr. Suess's words in this book are so inspiring for a boy like him.  The Dr says it perfectly when he writes ""You'll look up and down streets.  Look 'em over with care.  About some you will say, 'I don't choose to go there.' With your head full of brains and your shoes fun of feet, you're too smart to go down any not-so-good street.""

These words touch home with this boy.  His life has been full of choices, some that were not good ones.  Now he has the knowledge and the brains to stear clear of these places and watch what he does and where he chooses to go.  He has the knowledge to CHOOSE right and has the knowledge of what he should do.

I know for a fact that if I got a dictionary or something of that sort, it would be used even less than a book like this.  I know, because I got one and it is still sitting on my bookshelf and hasn't been opened since the day I got it.

Students these days use the computer for everything they need, like looking up words in a electronic dictionary.  It is so much easier and so much faster.

All I am trying to say is: when looking at something, please look at all sides of the situation.  What might be worthless to some, is the best gift others could get.

The first thing that I felt when reading your review was that I spent weeks thinking of a really great gift for my graduate and that getting this was like getting him garbage; just something that he can throw away.  When, in reality, it might be something that he keeps forever."

359,And the Mountains Echoed,159463176X,Khaled Hosseini,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Bookwoorm,"Khaled Hosseini's writing is masterfully meticulous, poetic and enchanting. 
He gives his characters depth and beauty in a way that few authors are able. 
The first half of this particular novel is brilliant, rich in detail and word; It reads like poetry. 
In the second half of the novel, Hosseini's intentions became too obvious, which was frustrating for me because in his other novels, he was able to subtly weave in what he wanted the reader to take from his novel. That said, and before I continue, I must say that despite this, the book is still powerful and still worthy of acclaim. This book touches upon the diaspora of Afghan citizens; there is no distinct main character - instead, each story is an account which represents the lives, hurdles and world perceptions of people who have fled Afghanistan, remained in Afghanistan, returned to Afghanistan, even touching upon Narco-terrorism and Taliban restrictions and ramifications. I found that several characters were essential only to the story in that they filled a slot where Hosseini intended to teach his reader. This is commendable for a writer and a novel however, the stories grew less heartening as the book went on. While a good writer knows that a happy ending can ruin a book, and I was pleased Hosseini did not travel this route, I was dissatisfied. I understand that that could have been Hosseini's intention as the plight of Afghanistan is heartrendingly dissatisfying. I still feel that Hosseini could have done better justice in the end of the book. His final narrator, Pari, was not as endearing or as instrumental to the story than others in it were. I was disappointed that she was gifted with closing such a massive, generational story. The frequent, interminable shifting of characters (none returned to) grew tiresome. Hosseini is gifted at drawing his readers in, so the changes did not ruin the story, but certainly took from my captivation. Nit-picking aside, I would recommend this novel with high praise for its poetic nature and educational undertones. Hosseini's writing is incomparable and I only give it such a tedious review because I know how capable he is. I will forever be a fan, buying and cherishing anything he publishes."

Hosseini explores the relationships between parents, their children, extended family and friends in such a way that no one else can. I immediately fell in love with these characters. I sympathized with them, celebrated with them, and explored their relationships with them. I really enjoyed this book and can't say enough good things about it! Hosseini's writing style is elegant and beautiful. He brings beauty to a country that has been consumed by war and violence for so many years. I love reading his books because I learn a little more about the culture every time, and I find it very fascinating!"

I found it quite enjoyable to read.  It was thought-provoking on it's issues and I was very impressed with the way that the writer created a dark, empty and claustrophobic atmosphere.  The human characters in the book were more complex and interesting than in the movie.

On the other hand, this is not the book to read in order to figure out the movie.  The movie's plot was simpler and more cohesive.  The book's story line is as murky and inconsistent as the future world that the book describes.  

Basically, the book raised lots of new issues to think about and didn't add much to my understanding of the movie.  It's a great book and I recommend it highly, if that's what you're hoping for."

Dick is not so much of a science fiction writer as he is a mystery writer who sets his plots and characters in imagined future enviroments.  His characters are interesting while humanly flawed and the plot twists keep you guessing and surprised.  Unlike some science fiction he doesn't focus on a narrative of a future world.  The details just kind of sneak out naturally as part of the plot.  What the future allows Dick to do is to change the rules and see how his characters fit into that environment.  But the humans still act like humans with all their flaws, and the androids, maybe more so."

It's a quick read; for anyone with a few hours to spare, I'd highly recommend it!"
361,Oliver Twist,0141439742,"Charles Dickens, George Cruikshank, Philip Horne",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"Charles Dickens uses the novel Oliver Twist similarly to his many other novels to portray the life of the poor through the struggle of the main character. Oliver Twist is a bast@rd child who is forced into an orphanage (workhouse) for the poor. He eventually runs off and gets tangled up with a group of other poor children who steal for their leader in crime Fagin.  While there, he learns the tricks of the trade and also discovers that it is not the life for him and struggles to get out.  Charles Dickens does an excellent job of ridiculing the upper and middle class for their treatment of the poor, while delivering an excellent story about the adventures of Oliver Twist."
361,Oliver Twist,0141439742,"Charles Dickens, George Cruikshank, Philip Horne",Barnes and Noble,4.5,readingissexy23,"After years of people telling me how great this book was I decided to read it to see what all the fuss was about.  It turned out that it lived up to my expectations.  This book is well written and a classic story about an orphan and his surrounding characters.  There is drama, fear, compasion, and so many more emotions Dickens put into this novel.  It's a good read; you won't be disapointed!"
361,Oliver Twist,0141439742,"Charles Dickens, George Cruikshank, Philip Horne",Barnes and Noble,4.5,bamagv,"Getting your child to read one of those classic novels can certainly be a challenge.  Thanks to Jonathan Keeble and Roy McMillian this task has been revolutionized. The classic story ""Oliver Twist"" by Charles Dickens has been retold for younger listeners on audiobook.  Created with children ages 8-13 in mind, this audiobook features the original text found in Dicken's classic but the words are simplified and clarified at certain points throughout the story to ensure that the child understands them and can easily follow along with the storyline. This audiobook re-telling of the classic Oliver Twist will keep children's attention and have them engaged in the story through its unique and captivating audio."
362,The Screwtape Letters,0060652896,C.S. Lewis,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"The Screwtape Letters is a book of correspondence, letters from a senior devil named Screwtape to his nephew, a ""junior tempter"" named Wormwood. It is great literature, and (obviously) quite religious -- brilliantly so, in that it takes the devil's POV to make arguments & observations.

If you want any further info regarding the literary content, consult a librarian or check Wikipedia. The rest of this review will be regarding the additional content of B&N's ""The Screwtape Letters - Special Illustrated Edition (Enhanced Edition)"".

First of all, this edition (according to other posters) will NOT work on an iPad. Additionally, it will NOT work on my PC (Windows 7) using the Nook for PC program. I suspect the cause of this is that, given all the extra features in this Enhanced nook book, it isn't compatible with the Nook app.

Secondly, I have no idea if this would work on a Nook Simple Touch. My guess is no -- and even if it did, without color, the videos & illustrations probably wouldn't look as great. But I don't work at B&N, so if you need to know, ask a sales rep.

BUT, this nook book DOES work perfectly on both the Nook Color (according to another reviewer) and on the Nook Tablet (which I can attest to).

So, with the specs out of the way:
This Enhanced nook book is absolutely amazing, and I am so glad I bought it. 

It has the complete text of the Letters, plus the text of ""Screwtape Proposes a Toast"" (also by C. Lewis, though published later). But all that you can find in most other editions. 
What's amazing about this one is the enhanced content: illustrations of Screwtape at the start of each chapter, and of Wormwood scattered throughout; videos with relevant historical and literary info, biographical info about the author, and more; and audio clips with recordings from famous performance of The Screwtape Letters, as well as interviews and a lot more.

To conclude, this is an incredible work of literature, greatly deserving of high-quality enhanced features. And this edition has delivered on that, beyond even my wildest dreams. BRAVO!"
362,The Screwtape Letters,0060652896,C.S. Lewis,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"This is not a moralizing book trying to convert people to Christianity.  Even as a Jew, I found Lewis's writing and religious beliefs to change my perspective on many things in life.  It is a well-written book that can be enjoyed by anyone."
362,The Screwtape Letters,0060652896,C.S. Lewis,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"The Screwtape Letters is more relevant today than ever. CS Lewis describes the temptations of today's times as well as yesterdays, validating the point that evil is consistant and hardworking, if nothing else. Masterfully done!"
363,"Anna and the French Kiss (Anna and the French Kiss, #1)",0525423273,Stephanie Perkins,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Girl-with-da-Boots,"Anna and the French Kiss is a phenomenal read. It is one of those books that draw you into the plot and it feels like you are actually there. The characters are very easy to connect to because they are teenagers who are very much human. By giving the characters faults and human qualities, Perkins makes the characters come alive! The plot was easy to follow with a few surprises here and there. Anna is the one that I could connect to the most. I could picture myself in her shoes and the happenings in the story were so life-like that they could have actually happened. To think that this book is actually filled with teenage drama, I actually loved this book and would recommend it to any teenage girl who is looking for a great book to read over the summer. I am looking forward to reading the next two books written by Perkins. Hopefully they will contain the same life-like qualities that draw you in."

363,"Anna and the French Kiss (Anna and the French Kiss, #1)",0525423273,Stephanie Perkins,Barnes and Noble,4.7,missy1029,"I don't think there are words to express my love for this novel. It was seriously that good. I can't believe that I waited so long to finally read it. I was a little worried I would be disappointed because it has been so hyped up and I am glad to say that I most definitely was not. This is one of those books that I will be pushing everyone that I know to read.

I adored Anna and St. Clair. They were one of my favorite duos ever. They fit so perfectly together. I also loved all of the supporting characters because well, without them, this story would not have been what it was. Teenage love in the city of romance. Yes, please! I virtually read this in one sitting because I did not want to put it down. Time flew by and I didn't even notice.

Even after I finished this I couldn't stop smiling. It was such a feel good book! It was so easy to connect with Anna. She handled certain situations in the same way that I could see myself doing. She was incredibly realistic! She could easily be someone who is a friend of mine. I swear that I could actually feel what Anna felt. I wanted to laugh when she laughed and cry when she cried. She was such an extremely likeable character!

I can't wait to see what else Stephanie Perkins has in store for us in the future!"

365,V for Vendetta,1401207928,"Alan Moore, David   Lloyd",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Tuna_Envelope,"V stands for Vengeance, Victory, Violence, but most importantly, V for Vendetta. Alan Moore's classic is one that needs to be read by every single comic book geek standing on this planet. It is a graphic novel that must be read by whose who want some social commentary, awesome action sequences, great art, or just read about  really interesting characters. There isn't much to say against V for Vendetta, in fact, I can't think of something to say against it. It is hard to review a book that I love, but I'll give it a try and I hope it turns out spoiler-free.
	Alan Moore is a man who loves social-criticism and he really love to play around with controversial topics like anarchism, totalitarianism, prostitution, sex, rape, and nudity (whoever knows who Dr. M is, will know what I mean). He is a very wise man that always tries to criticize governments and society as a whole. He creates these really cool and complex characters and the ones he created for this novel are V and Evey. V is a mysterious man who wears this mask that covers his face and Evey is a young girl whose parents were killed and now she lives alone in poverty and has only one way to pay for her necessities, prostitution. V goes on a personal mission to destroy this totalitarian British government named Norsefire. The story is set in a fictional time after the events of a violent Nuclear War. The book tells us to ""Remember, Remember the fifth of November"", we really don't know what happened that day until several pages in. This line has a compelling story line that goes with it that I won't spoil.
	The characters are well made, the story is rather intriguing, what else can be said about this masterpiece is the question. The answer is simple, the art style is great. I really love the contrast between dark and bright colors that is used throughout the novel. It really adds to the dark and mysterious themes, events, and characters that Moore created. The combination of the dramatic art-style and the awesome dialogue is just great. Sometimes drawings can say much more than written descriptions and in this book, this extraordinary thing happens (another great example of this is Maus by Art Spiegelman that I also recommend). By just seeing the colors, the drawing technique, and the shadings used we get the idea of the overall mood of the situation. So who made this artistic masterpiece? A guy named David Lloyd did.
	In conclusion, V for vendetta is a masterpiece. It should be read by every single comic book geek and literature lovers in this world because of the strong narrative and its art style. When you finish this book I recommend you to read Alan Moore's other novel, Watchmen and see the film version of V for Vendetta written and produced by the Wachowski Brothers because both are made using the same style and mood but."
365,V for Vendetta,1401207928,"Alan Moore, David   Lloyd",Barnes and Noble,4.3,JoyNerd,"After watching the film adaptation of V for Vendetta, I completely fell in love with the story, and the ever-so-mysterious character named ""V"". After finding out that it was originally a graphic novel, I hunted down this book right away. I thought it was fabulous. And the most interesting thing, though, is that the book is very, very different from the movie. Most films are almost never like the books, but these two have so many differences that I can almost consider them two separate stories. It was a bit confusing at first because I was expecting to read it as if I was reading the movie on paper, but there are more twists, the plot is rearranged, and the characters are a bit different (ex: in the movie, Evey is a young adult who has a job at the BTN, whereas Evey in the book is a 16 year old girl who resorts to prostitution). The book also follows more of a anarchism theme and the film follows more of a freedom theme. All in all, both the film and the graphic novel have their own strengths and it really is up to the reader to decide which one they prefer. I think they're both great in their own ways."
365,V for Vendetta,1401207928,"Alan Moore, David   Lloyd",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Disenchanted,I love Alan Moore's writing and V for Vendetta was awsome. The book was very dramatic and thrilling with lots of twists and turns. The story was so creative and interesting I couldn't put it down. I would definatly recommend this book to anyone.
366,John Adams,0743223136,David McCullough,Barnes and Noble,4.5,SamFS,"For anyone who loves history and especially this period of time in our country's life, this book is a must read.  Additionally, for the times we live in, this book shows the intense feelings, the ""Can Do"" spirit, and the commitment and dedication these colonists each show one another.  Brilliant minds all working together and warning us of the times we live in today...........Jefferson, Washington, Hancock & Franklin were outstanding and brilliant...............however, it took the noble lawyer from Boston to piece it all together..........The other great value is the language used which is completely gone today.I had to stop and keep the dictionary handy.............learned a great deal about our forefathers and the difficulties they faced in creating this country."
366,John Adams,0743223136,David McCullough,Barnes and Noble,4.5,ALLISTOMULL,"The life of John Adams is one I am glad I read about- filled with American history, the story is set through the American revolution and beyond, with an interesting look at our earliest presidents and their lives, and the policies they put in place over two hundred years ago that we still follow. I really enjoyed the incorporation of the Adams' letters to each other and others. Also, it was a good mix of history of the country and story of the man. I read this in the midst of our country's last presidential election, so it was interesting to see how different it was for our founding fathers and politicians of today."
366,John Adams,0743223136,David McCullough,Barnes and Noble,4.5,c.spencer,"David McCullough does a phenomenal job at bringing to life the larger than life person of John Adams. McCullough shows thoroughly the kind person John Adams was. He shows Adams to be a family man, a hard worker, an independent thinker, a dedicated stateman, a good father and husband, a farmer, and a man of faith. In addition to all these qualities, Adams had the foresight and integrity to stand against the degredations of slavery when so many of his contemporaries (e.g. Washington and Jefferson) helped to perpetuate the evil of slavery at a time when slavery was so in vogue and mainstream. Adams was a man who was as dedicated as any to the birth of the New Nation. He traveled across oceans and continents in service and advocacy of the new nation. He sacrificed years and precious time with his wife and kids all in service of the new nation. John Adams is a man who gets forgotten by many as one of the greatest Founding Fathers. Jefferson gets great credit as a key Founding Father, but to say that Jefferson was a man of greater character or importance than Adams is flat wrong. These two men were rivals for much of the later part of their lives, and I would argue that Adams was much the greater man. Adams face deserves to be on Mt. Rushmore as much as any of the four up there, save for Washington and Lincoln."
367,"Odd Thomas (Odd Thomas, #1)",0553384287,Dean Koontz,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"Odd Thomas is an amazing character, and I quickly learned why it is one of Dean Koontz's favorite characters. This book is full of drama that will keep you on the edge of your seat, and has a touch of romance that capture your heart. Koontz doesn't leave out comedy, though. Odd is very witty, and kept me laughing throughout the day. A very good book!"
367,"Odd Thomas (Odd Thomas, #1)",0553384287,Dean Koontz,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"My son gave me this book and I almost didn't read it, because I had heard Dean Koontz is much like Stephen King and I'm not really a big Stephen King fan. (King is the rare writer where I find the movie adaptations of his novels far better than the books) Anyway, I'm glad I did get to this one. Odd Thomas is such a loveable likeable and unlikely hero. Simple and with a strong sense of humility, he nevertheless possesses the un-asked-for ability to see dead people. And yes, he may have very well borrowed the idea from the Sixth Sense, but his character is so well developed, it is easy to overlook. This story has something for everyone. It is a story of the paranormal, a story of suspense, a comedy, a tragedy, and a love story all wrapped up in one nice package. Interestingly, when reading the few negative reviews, the people mostly mentioned that they felt the book was far too wordy and provided much too much detail. That is exactly why I don't care for Stephen King's books, but this to me seemed much more tame. All the possibly unnecessary conversations Odd Thomas has with his friends and acquaintennces serve to demonstrate Odd Thomas' wonderful heart and strong character. Which makes you feel that much more sad for him at the end. My only complaint with this story is that he seems to make some real jumps in assumption to figure out who the culprit is, and I had a tough time buying the reasoning for the slaughter. What would possess anyone to do such things? No past history of abuse? No plot to gain some kind of riches? Still, it was a good read. And since I didn't know until just now, I am pleasantly surprised to find out this is part of a series. I'll have to pick up the next one."
367,"Odd Thomas (Odd Thomas, #1)",0553384287,Dean Koontz,Barnes and Noble,4.4,babycakesDP,"Like Odd Thomas, I see what most others do not. I laughed, cried, and just could not put this book down. You will not be disappointed !!"

369,"Stargirl (Stargirl, #1)",0439488400,Jerry Spinelli,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Victoria-Star,"Books are good. I love books, actually, they're close to breathing on my scale. But out of the, say, a zillion books published each year, stamped with ink and piled accordingly in bookstores across our nation...how many are life changing? Realistic that's it's almost scary? and so emotional that you'll cry for an hour after closing the cover for the last time?
Stargirl did all these things, and more. It is truly a once in a lifetime book. It's beautiful, it's simple yet complex, it's life changing and life altering. The first time i read it (about a year or two ago) I cried in my bed for an hour after finishing it. It's just that touching, that beautiful, that emotional. I loved it. It's a book that cries to be re-read, treasured, passed down, and most of all...applied. stargirl carries a lesson all of us FAIL to redeem...be, your, self. No matter what others think. No matter what others do, or say. No matter how people try to suufocate your most precious dreams.
The story is simply enough. Stargirl, a homeschooler, attends a publci school in Arizonia. She is decidely different, in every way from her made up chosen name to her costumes as clothes rules. She is kind to everyone. She loves her neighbor as herself. she does deeds to strangers. She loves those who kill her. Leo meets her, falls in love...but cannot accept her. Slightly, but barely. The rest, dear reader, you'll have to find out for yourself. It's too amazing to give away even a minor spolier. I will say, that if you decide, after reading this humble review, to pick up this book, know that your life will NOT be the same after you finish it. It's a warning. This book alters your life.
Jerry Spinelli has a gift others dare to find. He can translate life simply, beautifully, not to mention without all the usual Young Adult gunk and junk (none of that is found here, so you know) in a way that's oringinal, realistic, and most of all...touching. This book is touching. And a tearjerker. I cannot reccomend this book more. It's a classic."
369,"Stargirl (Stargirl, #1)",0439488400,Jerry Spinelli,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Natalie Nielsen,I love this book!  Stargirl and Leo are such realistic characters. All girls seem to like the same music and dress the same way and talk the same and act the same but then you meet Stargirl who is unique and looks at things different. And doesn't care what people think about her. I think that anyone who gives this book a chance will love it from the start to finish.

370,"The Red Pyramid (Kane Chronicles, #1)",1423113381,Rick Riordan,Barnes and Noble,4.4,bookomouse,"I am really thinking Riordan has found his niche.  I have enjoyed the previous series, and this one is on par with its predecessor.  The characters were great and just when you thought everything was going to be ok, something bad would happen.  The way the author worked the characters into the story was great. You could always count on meeting a new god or major player just around the corner.  I would highly recommend this to anyone pre-teen or above."
370,"The Red Pyramid (Kane Chronicles, #1)",1423113381,Rick Riordan,Barnes and Noble,4.4,passionreader,"I must say Rick Riordan has a great start for a new series. If you just loved his Percy Jackson series then you will love this new series! The Red Pyramid is easy and fun to read, plenty of adventure to enjoy and laugh's in this book.I can't wait for the next book in the series. Great book for the young and old!"
370,"The Red Pyramid (Kane Chronicles, #1)",1423113381,Rick Riordan,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Daisy4,"The Red Pyramid (Kane Chronicles Series #1) was just an astonishing, well-written book. This book is full of magical pages that holds your breath until the end. Sadie and Carter make a great and idealistic replacement for all-star Percy and Annabeth. Sadie and Carter as siblings go through mythological adventures trying to stop the evil to rise. Rick Riordan, you did it again!!!
I would recommend this to every Percy Jackson fan because it holds you and you can't stop reading. Author Rick Riordan uses his creativity to form a fictional story, with great characters, about Ancient Egypt. The unexplainable adventures takes you to Egypt to present-day New York.
I would also recommend other wonderful books written by the indistinguishable author. These books include ""The 39 Clues: The Maze of Bones"" which brings you to another fascinating adventure. Also the upcoming series :""the Heroes of Olympus: The Lost Hero"" 
So once again I dare you to read just a wonderful book :""The Red Pyramid"" and find out by yourself how great is it!!!!"
371,Stranger in a Strange Land,0441788386,Robert A. Heinlein,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"First published in 1961, this book has been accused of being a product of the 60's, but what we think of as 'the 60's' didn't begin until mid-decade.  Amazingly, it sprang forth from the late 50's, where the American mind-set was neo-Puritanical, and women's and men's roles were well defined.  If anything, it helped shape the 60's, not the other way around.    Sure, the language is a bit stilted by today's standards, and the allegory of the 'Man from Mars' is a bit heavy-handed.  But several of the book's themes, including the concept of strong, intelligent, sexually liberated women, were quite radical at the time.    Don't expect hard science fiction.  The science is secondary to the human drama and the social commentary, which borders at times on satire.  And yet the Fosterites, which I had thought were quite absurd when I first read this, are shockingly similar to many personality-cult religious movements that have enjoyed wide popularity since then.    This book successfully mixes biting satire with a positive, even naive, view of how humans might live together in peace if they can learn to 'grok in fullness', to be freed from the slavery of their petty jealousies and narrow, ugly world views.  While shining a glaring spotlight on some of humanity's less pleasant characteristics, it still manages to leave you with a hopeful vision of how things might truly be."
371,Stranger in a Strange Land,0441788386,Robert A. Heinlein,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"This is NOT the proper, unabridged copy that was published at the writer originally intended.

It's still an okay book.  But it's simply not the same with almost 1/3 of the book missing."
371,Stranger in a Strange Land,0441788386,Robert A. Heinlein,Barnes and Noble,4.2,kaol,"I just reread this after many years absence from Heinlein. I must have read everything he wrote by the time I was 20, so now that I'm...not 20...I thought I'd see whether he was actually the storytelling virtuoso I remembered, and also how the science-fiction elements of this particular story had held up. He scored on both counts. In regard to the second, he was just vague enough about the details of things like flying vehicles and various electronic devices that they could fit just as easily into the future as the past. But finally on page 401, while Miriam is describing the effort to produce a Martian dictionary, Heinlein slips: ""[we] worked out a phonetic script for Martian, eighty-one characters. So we had an I.B.M. type worked over, using both upper and lower case...I type touch system in Martian now."" But though there's that mechanical typewriter at large in this otherwise future-sounding time isn't so bad given all of the other things he manages to work into the story without making it sound dated. Looking for stuff like that, though, was just fun on the side. The story itself, and the telling, is as fresh now as it was way back when. He does what a good writer should do by making an implausible situation and not a few implausible characters, sound everyday real, and interesting enough to keep turning those pages (or thumbing that touch screen). And that's why, almost 40 years after this was first published, and 22 years after Heinlein's death, this is still around, and being read by yet another generation. With many more to come."

372,Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim,0965904830,David Sedaris,Barnes and Noble,4.1,almondtea,"Just newly moved to NC myself, I stumbled across ""When You Are Engulfed In Flames"" about three months ago and have since been reading Sedaris almost religiously.  Dress Your Family in Corduroy & Denim is one of my personal favorites.  Sure, I could sit here and go blow by blow why I found the book entertaining.  But that would be the equivalent of someone messing up the best punch line to a really good joke.  And I mean that in the BEST sense.  Sedaris writes the way I have always suspected MOST PEOPLE think but are too PC to admit to it.  I can't fathom anyone not coming away feeling as if they too have found a kindred spirit with the author.  His writing reaffirms the every day observations we all seem to make mental notes of, but never voice out loud for fear of being ostracized. It makes one feel almost gleefully comforted to read his stories.  Quite honestly, a lot of the literature I've tackled over the past 7-8 months have been either too pretentious, predictable, and/downright depressing.  Suffice it to say I needed a BREAK away from all of the above and instead needed a good laugh!  Sedaris shamelessly hits those notes without fail.  It's refreshing I tell you!  And though I've lived out of the country for the past 6+ years, I know (now) that Sedaris has been around far longer than my absence.

374,A Short History of Nearly Everything,076790818X,Bill Bryson,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"I love Bill Bryson books.  My love for Bryson's clever and engaging writing style all started with A Short History of Nearly Everything.  I picked this book up one day with no real intention to read it cover to cover 'it was purchased for my husband and was lying around our house'.  After a chapter, I was hooked!  I love this book and have recommended it to others, who also were delighted with it.  I have read this book cover to cover at least 3 times.    A Short History of Nearly Everything is an informative and interesting look at our world.  If you like science (or reading in general), then I recommend this book.  Bill Bryson presents information in a way that makes it fun to learn.  It helps that Bryson is just plain funny.  This book presents everything in a way that makes it donwright fun to read.    As a side note, I also love A Walk in the Woods and In a Sunburned Country, also by Bill Bryson.  I find myself a but sad when I come to the end of a Bill Bryson book because I enjoy reading them so much 'I never want the book to end!'.  My solution is to run out and by something else he has written.  Never have I enjoyed reading so much!"

The book literally tries to cover the history of everything, focusing mainly on science and social advances.  Bryson wrote the book making it a point to sound as animated as possible, since this could be pretty dry material given the topic.  And he does a great job of engaging the reader, using hilarious anecdotes and keeping the style lighthearted.  

I found it very amusing to go through, and very informative.  Some parts were more entertaining than others, but that should be a given in a book like this.  If you're a fan of science, learning, or dry humor, then this is a good choice for you."

The book is what spurred me on to see the movie.  Although, I enjoyed the movie; had I not read the book first I would not have been able to follow the movie nearly as well as I did.  Even after seeing the movie, I have to say that I much prefer the book.  I don't care to have a movie make my choices for me.  I'd rather stretch my imagination.  The book will take any one with an active and appreciative imagination on a wild ride. I find Neil Gaiman to be a top notch author who knows how to intrigue the discerning reader.  There is no need for hot steamy sexual encounters to guage the romantic levels of a story - it's all in the mind.  Mr. Gaiman knows how to engage the mind.  Just as in real life, in this story; the romance is there if you as a reader know how to find it.  This book was a refreshing change from the ""in-your-face"" blatant sexuality of today's romance novels and the bloody gore of today's murder mysteries.  Don't get me wrong; in an entertainment venue I enjoy sex and violence just like the rest of the general populace.  But sometimes it's fun to take a step back and enjoy some innocent fun.  Mr. Gaiman delivers it all and more."
377,Stardust,0061142026,Neil Gaiman,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"You people are talking about the movie as if it was similar in any way to the book, when in fact, the two stories are just about as different as they could be. They might as well not even be related. I view the movie as a completely different tale from the book, both of them artistic and charming and adventurous. But they're both just too different to try and do what a disappointing amount of you people are doing. You can't hate the movie for not being close to the book because they made a completely different story out of it, and you can't hate the book for not having the same lighthearted feel as the movie because the book is, as it has always been, its own personal work of art. I love the book AND the movie as separate tales, because that's really the most logical way to look at it. Also, I notice people keep complaining about how boring they thought the book was. These are the type of people who sit in front of the TV for 24 hours each day because they feel the need to be constantly entertained. They probably wouldn't last an hour reading Lord of the Rings or the Hobbit, simply because they lack the brain power to stay attentive without their televised love triangles and sparkling vampires (Although with similar concepts, the two are meant to be unrelated here). So finally, the book can only be found dry if your imagination is."

We didn't like it because it was boring, had no climax, and wasn't very exciting. This book reminded us more of a documentary than a novel.

379,"A Discovery of Witches (All Souls Trilogy, #1)",0670022411,Deborah Harkness,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Saetana,"I have just finished reading this book and found it far more enjoyable than I expected to from reading the synopsis.  A Discovery of Witches is by a first-time fiction author and is set in modern times, the fantasy element comes in when we discover that the makeup of the world's intelligent creatures is only around 90% human with the other 10% comprising witches, vampires and daemons.  It is the story of Diana, the last witch in a long line of Butler witches who can trace their history back to the Salem Witch Trials.  Diana has spent most of her life denying her magical abilities, her parents were killed when she was very young and fear plays a large part in her reluctance to use magic.  When she discovers a mysterious lost (and magical) file in a library whilst researching the history of alchemy her life changes in a major way.  She meets a gorgeous male vampire, Matthew, a distinguished scientist, who is a lot older than he looks, and he appoints himself as her protector against the horde of witches, vampires and daemons who want to know the secret of the missing manuscript, they all have their own theories about what this work contains and will stop at nothing to get it.  

This is obviously the first book in a series and has both romantic and thriller elements in addition to its modern fantasy theme, it started a little too slowly for my liking but it is well worth persevering as once the pace picks up it is very hard to put down.  In this society, vampires and witches hate each other as a general rule and the relationship that develops between Diana and Matthew has serious repercussions for the whole of non-human society.  The dynamic between the two of them is fascinating, and more than a little erotic, this book is likely to appeal to women far more than men.  Diana is feisty, Matthew is controlling, the clashes between the two of them, particularly as Diana learns just how much power she has, are sometimes emotional, sometimes humorous and always entertaining.  I particularly loved the Bishop family house where Diana's aunt and her female partner (both witches themselves) live, I won't spoil the surprise but its certainly no ordinary home and the events that take place there provide some of the most humorous moments in the story as well as one of the most dramatic.  This novel will definitely appeal to fans of Anne Rice's Mayfair Witches and Vampire Chronicles novels and I am looking forward to the next instalment.  Be warned, it has a cliffhanger ending!"
379,"A Discovery of Witches (All Souls Trilogy, #1)",0670022411,Deborah Harkness,Barnes and Noble,4.2,avidreader256,"I was warned by my Pop to never begin a book if you know it will be part of a set that is not yet completed. I have heeded his advice in the past but, unfortunately, I started reading this book before I realized it was set to be a part of a trilogy. By then, it was too late. I was hooked. 

There are elements of the book that remind me of the Lord of the Rings (the idea of different species all having to overcome prejudice to accomplish a goal for example).  But the centerpiece of the book is a romance between a witch and a vampire. Oddly enough, I am not usually a fantasy reader, nor do I usually find myself interested in vampires in particular. I worked at a bookstore and banded together with several other booksellers who all refused to read Twilight, for example (because it had become so mainstream).  Also, I usually scoff at romance novels because of their cheesy nature and obvious patriarchal stereotypes (I did like the Traveler's Wife, though, so I do enjoy a good romantic story occasionally). When this book came up as a recommended reading, I was in the mood for an escape, so I took a chance on the book. I read some of the negative reviews and can see where they are coming from. If you are trying to find enlightenment through reading material, this probably isn't for you. If you want an enchanting escape from the mundane, on the other hand, I say this is a fantastic choice. But if you are anything like me, you will find yourself getting sucked in and thoroughly frustrated when you realize that you will have to wait for the next in the series to come out. So if you don't want to itch with anticipation, wait a few more years before entering into Deborah Harness' world of witches, demons, vampires, history, mystery and intrigue."

380,Norwegian Wood,0375704027,"Haruki Murakami, Jay Rubin",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Weird_Science,"A love story like no other, but then again, it's not really like any other love story around. It brings to question as to what love is, what do we consider love to be and what exactly are we looking for when we are in love? This book helps bring back an individual who has suffered from a servere break-up or current divorce because it gives the reader a chance to find himself again, and in some case closure or peace of mind. If you're looking to bounce back from depression and enjoy yourself and your own life, I highly recommend this book!!"

Of course, that IS a gross simplification of a novel which presents some fairly complex themes, such as love, identity, duty, and many others.  If one is looking for a read with some texture and depth, look no further.  However, if one is looking for an easily digestible, pulp fiction read, he should probably look elsewhere."
380,Norwegian Wood,0375704027,"Haruki Murakami, Jay Rubin",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Aglaia,"This is not my favourite novel by Haruki Murakami, but I still enjoyed it. I don`t think it is as great as The Wind-up Bird Chronicle, for instance, but the slow pace of this novel, the dreaminess is great, the characters are very true, very real. It is essentially the story of first and second love and how we open our hearts to another human being, by sometimes risking all that we have.
Apparently this is the book that made Murakami famous in the Western world, which I find strange, not because the book is bad, no  - it is a great book. But this novel is actually rather different from his other works.
I heartily recommend it, but also to read other books from the same author, because they are different."

While living in Wal-mart, she meets some interesting people whom later on lead her to the woman she's meant to be and through to her life calling. I really enjoyed this book. Where the Heart is helps you to realize who you are. This book helped me realize that, your heart is what gets you to where you want to be. It shows you that heart can get you through anything, and that love is the strongest weapon life could hand to you. There were very few parts in the book that I didn't like. I mainly didn't like the sad parts of the book. While reading Where the Heart is, you feel connected to the characters, and when something happens to one of them, you can't help to feel their pain. Girls would probably enjoy this book more than guys, but they can also read it. If you're looking for a book to help you find yourself and change your views on life, I would suggest to you, Where the Heart is. This is a good read that had me interested throughout."

Anyways, I think anyone between the ages of 14 - 21 should read this book. I'm not saying anyone whose not in that age limit wouldn't like it. But I do think it will appeal to them more.

382,"Will Grayson, Will Grayson",0525421580,"John Green, David Levithan",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"Some reviewers have called WG,WG ""disturbing"" and ""risky,"" or have commented on how mature the material is. Some have even expressed regret over buying it, unaware that it would be so blatant in some of its dealings with sex, pornography, and depression.

THIS IS A WORK OF LITERATURE! As such, it deals with themes that might be considered offensive. 
D.H Lawrence wrote about astoundingly offensive things in novels such as ""Lady Chatterly's Lover"" (how many times does he use the ""c"" word?).
 ""The Catcher in the Rye""  dealt just as frankly with the idea of teenage sexuality as WG, WG does.
Even Bronte's ""Jane Eyre"" was a social shocker in its time.
So should authors be expected to steer clear from any content deemed ""socially unacceptable/offensive""? Did Lawrence or Salinger or Bronte?
No.
Authors face these issues head-on, with the courage, insight, and tenacity that many others lack. They reveal to us (the general populace) the very basis of human nature--and sometimes that includes uncovering the seedy underbelly of humanity. 
WG,WG is a fantastic novel. It's beautifully written, thought-provoking, and it stays with you long after you've physically abandoned it. John Green and David Levithan are tender, insightful, and oh-so gut-wrenchingly real as the two Will Graysons.
I strongly recommend this novel to anyone who has a heart for truth and a yearning to tap into (and hopefully understand a little bit better) the ""miracle of human consciousness.""

383,A Million Little Pieces,0307276902,James Frey,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"A Million Little Pieces by James Frey is an inspiring book about one man's journey through a rehab clinic for addiction to alcohol since he was 10, cocaine since he was 12, and many other substances since, such as PCP, glue, acid, mushrooms, meth, and pills. A Million Little Pieces is the story of James' journey to get, and stay, sober.
	When 23-year-old James Frey first arrives at the treatment facility he has a hole through his cheek, his four front teeth knocked out, his nose broken and his eyes almost completely swollen shut. He woke up this way on a plane with no idea where he was going or how he had gotten there. He is covered in spit, snot, vomit, sweat, urine and blood and can barely remember anything about the past few weeks. When his parents pick him up at the Chicago airport he finally allows them to take him to Hazelden treatment center in Minnesota.
	As you get through the book you learn that this is not the typical bad life, bad parents situation; Frey was raised in warm, loving home by an affluent family. His family had no idea of his actions, and he did a good job hiding it from them. During the book he sometimes seems normal and sometimes the farthest thing from it. The story is captivating and gripping, the kind you can't put down.
	I would recommend this book to anyone in high school and above. There is language and violence, so if you have a hard time with gory or curel situations and dialogue this probably isn't the book for you. It is an honest and straightforward memoir, one of the best I've read in a long time. If you were looking for a meaningful book you'll want to read more than once, I would say check out A Million Little Pieces by James Frey."

For all the action and love drama I didn't think could get packed into such speedy reads.

384,"Frostbite (Vampire Academy, #2)",1595141758,Richelle Mead,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Anonymous,"It starts out where Rose and Dimitri head out in his Honda to go see Arthur so Rose can take her test that she missed while she was gone. Arthur and other hdampir's are found dead. Rose is shaken up by this, and stressed out with everything else going on in her life- like her mother showing up at the academy. 
 The romantic tension is obviously hard to ignore for both Rose and Dimitri. And here and their they both have their fair share of slip-ups. But so far Dimitri does seem to be the one maintaining the control. . . until it becomes too much, and he tries to forget Rose by running into Tasha's arms (Christian's aunt).
 It's obvious that Rose is confused and heart-broken- who wouldn't be when the guy you love is trying to fall in love with someone else? So she does some pretty stupid things that include leading Mason on to believe she might actually have stronger feelings for him than she really does, being cold and mocking to Tasha, flirting with Adrian- a royal- in front of Dimitri, and back lashing and angry at Dimitri (But who can really blame her for that? Gawd, I'd be the same way!) 
 I love this series and this second book- Frostbite is pretty good. I love the romantic tension between Rose and Dimitri! GREAT SERIES. CAN'T WAIT FOR FIFTH BOOK TO COME OUT!"
385,Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking,0307352145,Susan Cain,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Valca85,"As an introvert myself, this book drew me in just from the title, and I can truly say this is a fascinating study of what being an introvert means.
With a mixture of anecdotes and scientific research, Cain explores how introverts function, what makes us act the way we do, and why in this day and age it is such a difficult thing to be respected as someone who is different. Most of us have faced all of the things she mentions, from teachers who think that there is something wrong with children who prefer to read than play, to the minutia like making small talk that can drain some of us of all energy. She does a fantastic job of explaining why we function in this manner, and she manages to show us that we are not wrong in the way we act; we are just different.
The narrative is always interesting, keeping the reader engaged all the way through the book. Although this is a serious research book, it never bores, on the contrary, it is hard to put down. There is a wonderful section on how to take care and nurture an introverted child, which can be a challenge since most of society is geared towards extroverts.
 Introverts need different things, and modern life refuses to provide those things, with its constant rewards for those who speak the loudest, whether they have the right answer or not. If you are an introvert, or if you know an introvert, this is a great read. I highly, highly recommend it."

I am planning on reading it out loud to my non-bookreading husband who has always struggled with shyness (which is related to introversion). As I read I realized I was an introvert surrounded by introverts trying to pretend I wasn't one. And worse, I realized I have always tried to force my children to be extroverts in such an extrovert centered culture. Now if I have only read the introduction and have figured all this out, imagine what you will know after reading the entire book! I also want to help raise the rating of a good book that was pulled down by a single disgruntled person and one star."
385,Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking,0307352145,Susan Cain,Barnes and Noble,4.3,E_M_13423,"The author of &ldquo;Quiet&rdquo; is an admitted introvert. She did a wonderful job countering misconceptions about introversion. As an introvert myself I have always felt inferior at school and work compared to my very talkative and outgoing peers. Introverts are not people with a personality flaw. They are people who recharge their batteries by being alone while extroverts recharge theirs by socializing. Introverts are thinkers, sensitive, serious, thoughtful, and reserved people. While they appear quiet and repelling, their minds are actually racing with creative ideas and planning their next exciting project rather than wasting time with idle small talk. Some of the most famous and renown people in history were introverts."

That was 15 years ago and I still remember the story from beginning to end. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys reading and the knowledge that can be gained from it.
386,"Island of the Blue Dolphins (Island of the Blue Dolphins, #1)",0440439884,Scott O'Dell,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"I remember reading Island of the Blue Dolphins when I was eleven.  Recently I found my old copy, dusted it off, and started from the beginning.  I could not put the book down.  It was just as fresh to me as it was twenty-five years earlier.  This is a book all ages can enjoy.  I'm looking forward to reading it to my daughter in a few years.  Scott O' Dell beautifully created a strong female protagonist that figured out a way to survive against the odds."

I love books that have the ocean in them. The book tells the story of a girl named Karona. She is left on the island for 18 years. While she is waiting for a ship to come get her she must build shelter, gather and hunt food, and fight her enemies the wild dogs. I thought this book would be a regular old book with a beggining, middle, and an end. I sure was wrong! Karona even befriended a wild dog! I recomend this book for ages 9 and up. If you are younger than 9, and you like true stories you will enjoy this book."
387,The Crucible,0142437336,"Arthur Miller, Christopher Bigsby",Barnes and Noble,3.9,bekmort,"For the last four years I have taught ""The Crucible"" to high school Juniors using a class set of the Penguin Classics version of the play.  Needing more copies, I placed an order for some with my school's librarian.  Thinking he'd save money, he bought this version.

*It is not the same version of the play.*

This version of the play reads more like a script (complete with detailed stage directions and set design/layout) and is better suited for performing the play, not reading it in a classroom setting.

Differences:
* This play is divided into 2 main Acts, not the original 4
* Miller's commentary and character descriptions are omitted (vital sections if you want to link the play to McCarthyism)
* The dialogue is different; certain (sometimes key) lines are omitted.

Bottom Line:  It's an inferior copy of the play, and it is worth the few extra dollars to buy the other version."
387,The Crucible,0142437336,"Arthur Miller, Christopher Bigsby",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"I had to read this book for my Honors english class, and at first it was a bit weird, like I kind of didn't understand what was happening. But as I read on, it became a wonderful book that I recommend to any High School student, looking for a good read."
387,The Crucible,0142437336,"Arthur Miller, Christopher Bigsby",Barnes and Noble,3.9,ADBreader,"Since I was a little girl I've been interested in witch stories and everything related. Not in the Harry Potter kind of way, but in the more realistic; the witch hunts in medieval time Europe, the people hanged and burnt at the stake and the Salem Witch Trials. Because I was a little girl who loved to watch TV documentaries, my knowledge in those subjects was fed by channels like Discovery and later History. I'd never read before an actual book about this, like I've done with other historic matters of my interest, until some weeks ago, all the information I wanted to know was looked up in the internet.
One day I was looking up for books at Amazon.com  like I usually do, when I came up with this play, a classic of American Literature by Arthur Miller (may he rest in peace),  based in the Salem Witch Trials of 1962. As I normally do, I did research on the book and thought about it. It wasn't until some weeks ago I finally acquired it. I just finished reading The Crucible some days ago and I absolutely adored it. I think Mr. Miller did an excellent job bringing the characters and the story back to live. The historical accuracy of the play is not precise, for he fused some characters into one, increased and decreased the characters' ages, reduced the number of girls involved and developed the characters' personalities to relate among others. Above all this, he made of the play a masterpiece, just like he did with the 1996 screenplay for the film version starring Daniel Day-Lewis and , one of my favorite actresses, Winona Ryder, who I must admit did an excellent job portraying her first antagonist role, Abigail Williams. It's a shame the box-office numbers didn't match the great critics the film received.
Back on praising the play, one of the things it fascinated me the most was the language used, which was taken out of the King James Bible. I absolutely loved how the dialogues showed in a beautiful way the relationships between the characters, whether they were lovers, family or enemies. Through all the play, I was in Abigail Williams' side. I don't know if it was because Winona did an excellent job in the role, or I just had fun with the way she ""sported"", to say it in her words, with everyone, and how she controlled the rest of the people. Historically speaking, Abby was a twelve year old orphan that accused town people of witchcraft, contrary to the seventeen year old girl of the play. Miller increased Abigail's age to allow the plot device of the relationship with John Proctor, whose age was decreased from 60 to 30.
The story begins with the girls doing some kind of ""ritual"" in the woods. (this part is just mentioned in the play, but it is shown in the film)The Reverend finds them. Rumors of witchcraft start to fly, when some girls can't wake up. The presence of the Devil in Salem is feared. From there the plot keeps developing, accusations start and town people are arrested. Along the story a lot of people turn their backs at each other to save themselves. At the end of the play the accused citizens remaining are hanged. 
Even though I absolutely enjoyed reading The Crucible, I wouldn't recommend this to somebody that likes reading teenage love stories or is looking for a light, short book, for it is very dark and complex. If someone wants to read this, I think he or she should read about the subject first or watch some documentary to get familiar with the subject. Watching the film is a great visual help."

Most of the book is about a 13 year old boy named Brian who survives in the Canadian Wilderness. He had to survive from wild animals and try not to starve to death! From being a city boy his skills won't help him here.This book is good,read it!"
388,"Hatchet (Brian's Saga, #1)",0689840926,Gary Paulsen,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"The Hatchet by Gary Paulsen was a great ""chapter book"" for our family.  My boys are 10 and 6 years old.  They could remember each night what happened the night before because they really cared about the main character, Brian.  My son's 3rd grade teacher is now reading it to her class.  Even the ""restless"" kids are silent and still.  
I think the writing style lends itself a bit better to silent reading as opposed to reading aloud because it is all thoughts in Brian's head.  The thought segments made for a bit awkward reading at times but worth the effort.  
I love books that can offer knowledge we can store in the back of our minds for future reference if needed.  Challenging times make us stronger!
Some 6 year olds may find some parts too scary, but 8 and up will love it."

389,"The Final Empire (Mistborn, #1)",076531178X,Brandon Sanderson,Barnes and Noble,4.5,IrishYndina,"Brandon Sanderson continues to amaze me with his in-depth and well thought out magic systems, all of which are unique.  In this book, magic is hereditary and can only be accessed by swallowing and then ""burning"" metals.  The differences in who can or can't use magic and who can burn one or all metals creates an intricate political and social system the compliments the plot superbly.

The plot itself is masterful.  The story has the feeling of a heist with everything at stake.  There are constant twists, problems arising (as always happens in real life), and a delicious ending.

Another thing I enjoyed about this Sanderson book in particular is that the characters seem more and more real as the book goes on.  The more his characters react, the less they seem like stock character cutouts and the more they begin to walk off the page.  He gives everyone both motivation and personality when too many authors seem to choose one or the other.  

I highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys solid fantasy or heist stories.  It also comes at the epic fantasy from a different angle, since in this story the epic hero didn't quite save the world as he should have so many years before, and the world has become a dark and oppressive place.  Highly entertaining.  I would read this book again, if I didn't have the other two books in the trilogy to read first."

The ash that is everywhere symbolizes his Final Empire rule  the lack of flowers anywhere represents the lack of hope.  No one, purebred Skaa, hybrids, or otherwise, dares even think of rebellion in this vile wasteland if they want to survive another day out side the evil dungeons.--------------    That is none until a half-breed common thief Kelsier survives the ordeal of Lord Ruler¿s imprisonment by losing his mind.  He begins to ¿develop¿ super skills that enable him to do the impossible.  The thief plans to end the evil regime by overthrowing initially the sycophantic cowardly nobles and culminating with the death of the Lord Ruler.  His charisma obtains followers, but his big break occurs when Kelsier meets Skaa street waif Vin, who has the same Mistborn powers that Kelsier learned to use in the torture chambers.  Kelsier arranges for Vin to go undercover within the nobles¿ Great Houses.  However, the rebel leader fails to comprehend emotions as his female mole falls in love with Prince Elend Venture.--------------    MISTBORN, the first book of the Final Empire series, is a terrific coming of age epic fantasy that uses a what if premise in which the Dark Lord killed the good guy hero (the Hobbit or Beowulf loses to the evil adversary), which leads to a fabulous world in which evil rules absolutely evilly.  Vin holds much of the plot together, but Kelsier is the more fascinating character as a Hans Solo type in fantasy land.  The Lord Ruler is out of Tolkien 101, but that is to be expected as the regime the malevolent one built pays homage to the foul sides of The Lord of the Rings.---------------    Harriet Klausner"
389,"The Final Empire (Mistborn, #1)",076531178X,Brandon Sanderson,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"Considering I'm 35 and have been reading for enjoyment since i was a child, it always makes me excited to discover a new author whom writes exceptionally well and has an interesting, original plot. The only problem I seem to have is the negative reviews. I understand everyone has a view and right to defend view, yet, in my opinion the negative reviews seem blatantly inaccurate. The charactors are personable and story is far from monotonous. The storyline with magic system is unique with some originality. So my question posed is what books/authors are being considered superior written over Sanderson? I find Sanderson appealing and can vouch his writings are more exciting, mature and story line executed superbly when compared to a fair amount of modern authors flooding the market. My opinoin..but fairly backed. Grab the book. You will love it!"
390,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,0451528956,"Robert Louis Stevenson, Vladimir Nabokov, Mervyn Peake, Dan Chaon",Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,"'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde' is very well-written and intriguing. The true horror of the tale is not so much the fate of the experimental Dr. Jekyll as a result of his tampering with his soul, but rather the chilling possibilty presented to the reader that if he or she had the same opportunity for evil, the story might well be the same. This novella left me wondering if the potential for such evil as is present in Mr. Hyde really exists in the recesses of everyone's soul. The creepiness of this tale isn't strongly present during the reading of it, but upon contemplating it afterwards, the eeriness sets in."
390,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,0451528956,"Robert Louis Stevenson, Vladimir Nabokov, Mervyn Peake, Dan Chaon",Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,"I'm 14 years old, and recently had to read Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde for my English assignment. The assignment was comparing this fiction text, to a non-fiction text about crimes in a similar era. I think that Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde was good for this assignment, however it was a bit too slow moving for me."
390,The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,0451528956,"Robert Louis Stevenson, Vladimir Nabokov, Mervyn Peake, Dan Chaon",Barnes and Noble,3.7,kw50197,"Like Frankenstein, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a tale of a good man who lets his ambitions lead him astray. But unlike Frankenstein, where one should not judge by looks alone, Mr. Hyde is exactly as he appears. To borrow a cliche, evil incarnate.

While most of Frankenstein is told from a first-person's perspective, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is narrated by several people who have either met Hyde or knows Jekyll. If I wasn't already aware of how the story played out, I imagine this would have been a great setup for the dramatic revelation at the end. As it is, there are times when I couldn't help but forget about the ending in my search for any tell-tale hints early on to clue in the reader. There are a few but I'm not sure I could have made the correct deduction on my own.

The battle between the personalities of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is supposed to reflect the duality of man, a battle of good versus evil. If so, the ending is a rather pessimistic outlook isn't it ? Mr. Hyde as the personification of evil may not have escaped just punishment but at least in his struggles with Dr. Jekyll, he gained the upper hand. However if the winner of their battle was Dr. Jekyll, the tale might not have been as memorable. That is my take at least.

An enjoyable read. Definitely should be read at least once."

They were all crazy about the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series and now I know why. The book is perfect for the ADD/ADHD children because of the transition between writing and pictures.

393,"Throne of Glass (Throne of Glass, #1)",1599906953,Sarah J. Maas,Barnes and Noble,4.5,kimba88,"The tale begins when we meet eighteen year old Celaena Sardothien. She is Ardarlan&rsquo;s most feared Assassin. The world is at war, and Celaena has spent the past year in the deadly salt mines of Endovier. Known for being a brutal prison; most do not last more than a few months. Starved and scarred she is summoned and assumes it is for her death. Prince Dorian Havilliard of Adarlan makes her an offer. If she wins the king&rsquo;s competition for a royal assassin she can gain her freedom. Despite her hatred for the king, she readily accepts the prince&rsquo;s offer. At Rifthold Castle she trains, makes friends and discovers secrets about herself and the castle. The tale that unfolds kept me riveted. Filled with romance, mystery and danger, I devoured this novel in two evenings. The characters were all fascinating from the cruel and power hungry king to the mysterious Princess Nehemia. Celaena has to be one of my all time favorite protagonists. She is smart, fearless and charming. She can be snarky, quick witted and utterly delightful. Trained from the age of eight she is a deadly weapon and yet she can be completely feminine. Her conversations with the main characters had me laughing aloud. She is complex and I loved seeing all the different sides of her. The novel hints at things to come with Celaena and I cannot wait to see her growth in this series. The Captain of the Guard, Chaol Westfall, is assigned to watch, train, and guard Celaena. He doesn&rsquo;t trust her in the beginning but their relationship grows. I really connected with him and found him to be noble, sensitive and loyal. The Crown Prince, Dorian Havilliard hasn&rsquo;t yet learned to stand up to his father. I felt sorry for this quite, sensitive man. Celaena draws him out and allows Maas to reveal the many facets of this would be king. The elements of a love triangle are in place, and I waivered back and forth between the two men. Other characters added to the intrigue, suspense and mystery. Some I adored like Nox and some I loathed like Cain and Lady Kaltain. I seriously wanted to scratch her eyes out more than once..LOL. The world building was fantastic, brilliant and spell-bounding. Maas breathed life into the glass castle, the characters and the world of Adarlan. In a world filled with Fae, witches and magic, the mortal king has outlawed all forms of magic. Celaena is well versed in the Fae and has a healthly fear of them. When she discovers Wyrdmarks around the castle she is intrigued and sets out to learn their meaning. I became swept up in the mystery of these marks and the discoveries she made. Something is brutally killing off the competitors and it doesn&rsquo;t appear to be human. This adds a great deal of suspense to the tale. I loved the competitions the champions had to endure. I found myself on the edge of my seat as Celaena completed each phase. Maas has done an incredible job of weaving many different plots into a tale that is rich with well fleshed out characters. While this tale doesn&rsquo;t end on a cliff-hanger, Maas leaves us with enough unanswered questions and suspense to have this reader itching to read book two. I want to thank Bloomsbury Publishing and netGalley for providing this ARC in exchange for my unbiased review."
393,"Throne of Glass (Throne of Glass, #1)",1599906953,Sarah J. Maas,Barnes and Noble,4.5,sandyemerson,"Lots and lots of mixed feelings about this book!


Okay, let me start of by saying I love the story line of this book.  There was something about the building of this world that I could see so clearly, especially at the start with the opening scene being at a salt mine.  It gave the aura of oppression and of a story just ready to be told.


The whole journey and the events in the castle itself kept me riveted and the pace kept me alert and interested in what was happening around me, especially when the killings started happening.  I liked the whole mythical side to the story and how it was brought out in the plot.  


However, reading Throne of Glass was somewhat bittersweet.  I had an extreme love/hate relationship with all the characters.


Most of all with Celaena  - She was proud of who she was and there was no denying that, but at the same time she was narcissistic and totally full of herself.  Now I know that wasn&rsquo;t the way she was meant to come across, but every now and then she said something or thought something that made me, well, want to slap her.  Haha, never mind that she could possibly kill me with my own fingernail.  While she was virtually fuming because she couldn&rsquo;t tell the whole world who she was, I was silently thinking, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be too proud because you&rsquo;re nothing more a glorified hitman.&rsquo;  And, what&rsquo;s really weird is that I didn&rsquo;t feel that way at all about Ismae from 'Grave Mercy'.  


I think I questioned some of her wisdom too.  Within certain situations of the book, I could see why something was being done and I thought it was pretty smart, but not Celeana.  Because she didn't have anyone going 'ooh I scared.  I am in the presence of a great and powerful murderess...' -cough-'assassin.'  I think the reason I couldn't relate to her was because I didn't know enough of her back story.  I felt that only minimal information was given to the reader and so didn't help with my overall impression of her.


But, there were moments when I could have liked her.  In certain scenes within the book, I saw her softer side and that was the side that made me warm up to her.  She wasn't being selfish or shallow in those times.  She cared about things &ndash; like her dog and the princess.    She got hurt easily especially when she felt she had been betrayed.  Maybe she was just a complex character, but I've read other complex characters and they didn't leave me feeling like this.


The guys weren't quite as bad, but they were bad enough.  I hated how they seemed to lose a sense of themselves with Celaena.  Can't we have one book, just one, where ALL characters remain true to themselves?  And why do we have to have these love triangles?!  Why can't a girl just be left alone, or have the relationship develop over time - to ONE boy?  You can build romantic tension with just one boy.  You don't need two.  I think another thing that got to me was I never even got a sense on why each boy fell for Celaena.  No legit reason!  None! 


I must seem like I'm ranting and I guess I am in a way.  But, I was just so disappointed in a story that could have been so much better than what it was.  That's not to say that I won't go on to read the sequel, because I will.  I want to see what happens in the world Sarah J. Maas created.  I want to know more about Celaena and what drives her.  I want to see what happens to the Rulers, the princess and the people, including Elena's purpose. 


Overall, I thought the book was okay.  I didn't hate the book, but I didn't like it that much either.  It was just okay.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes action, love triangles, female assassins and fantasy.

Henry struggles with his identity, his stubborn father, and when his best friend, a Japanese American girl, is sent to an internment camp he has to decide between love and loyalty. This book is like a little slice of history complete with the sights, sounds and smells of Seattle during World War II, jazz music, salty sea air, and the sweet taste of duck sausage. There are so many themes touched in this story that it should feel overly crowded: first love, father-son relationships, immigrants, racism, and looming over everything World War II. Yet the story flows around and through Henry seamlessly and it is easy to find yourself deep in his world. I completely and unashamedly fell in love with this book from the very beginning. At first I raced through it eager to see what would become of Henry, later I slowed my progress wanting to prolong my time with him and anxious about his ending.

This is another of those books that you see so much hype about and think there's no way it could be as good as people are saying.  Just a moment while I pause and wipe away the tears.

I've read my fair share of World War II stories.  I've seen it from all sorts of angles, but this was the first time I'd seen this side of it.  It's so easy to get caught up in what was going on in Germany ( and there's nothing wrong with that) that other things lose the spotlight when they don't deserve to.  The treatment of the American Japanese was horrifying and heartbreaking and this book spotlights that in the most intimate of ways.

This is a love story, most of all.  Not your typical harlequin romance, but a story of deep, abiding love.  There's patience, hope, despair and more all wrapped up in the love that begins between, of all people, two 12 year old children.  

I read this book only because the book club I plan on attending for the first time tomorrow has chosen it for their book of the month.  Even if I don't enjoy the club I'll be thankful to it for introducing me to this story.  It's a beautiful one and one I'll be reading again."
396,Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet,0345505336,Jamie Ford,Barnes and Noble,4.1,sweetpeaSP,"This book does a terrific job exploring the history and attitudes of this time period and ethnic neighborhoods. This is a story of a culmination of cultures, also politics, loyalty, language, expectations, honor and dreams. The story, set in Seattle, begins in 1986 with the discovery of relics stored in the basement of the Panama Hotel by American citizens of Japanese heritage. These treasures lead Henry Lee, a Chinese American whose best friend was Japanese, to reminisce about that time, in flashbacks to the 40's. Wonderful relationships in Henry and Keiko, Henry and his father, Henry's mother and his father, and Henry and his own son are deep and touching.  This story reveals the best and worst in relationships, the way we regard others, and the way we catch ourselves acting like our parents with our own children. This is a truly amazing read!

Woods",Barnes and Noble,4.2,FocoProject,"This is the fist book I have picked up from the thread of recommended reading at Eat Poo, and what a fantastic pick it was. Already I had heard from numerous pooers that the book was a good one, so I really had little debating to do. In fact the hardest decision was whether to pick this up first or ¿The Time Traveller¿s Wife¿ (I picked both up, when I was not able to make up my mind).In a stroke of genius on the part of the author, this story unfolds tackling the most literally unexplored of our senses¿that is the sense of smell. From beginning to end, there is so many scents to gather in from this book, that you could nearly tire your nose at it. For the first time I found myself understanding a story or a setting or a character not so much by what they look like, or what they are wearing but rather by the way things smell.Mr. Suskind does a fabulous job telling the story of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, born in 18th Century France with a superior sense of smell, but no actual scent of his own. Out-casted and ignored for reasons people around Grenouille can not understand, the child is slowly shaped into an individual that learns not to trust or count on anybody, hardening his heart and shaping himself to eventually become a king of his own empire¿the realm of the scent. Driven by his uncanny abilities, Grenouille sets out to create the world¿s most perfect smell and use it to his advantage.What ensues is one of the most interesting, curious, strangest stories I have ever read, while also quite disturbing and morbidly erotic."

398,Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal,0060838582,Eric Schlosser,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Phil_Slender,"While very reminiscent of Upton Sinclair's 1906 novel, ""The Jungle"", Eric Schlosser manages to convey the same provocative and enlightening messages in his 2001 novel, ""Fast Food Nation"".  While a bit outdated, the overall themes featured in the novel still hold relevance in today's society and truly make a person think twice about going to fast food restaurants in the future.  The book is divided into two sections: a history of fast food chains, and then the ""behind-the-scenes"" production of fast food in more recent history.  Throughout the novel, Schlosser aims to show his audience the truth about what fast food chains do to reach high production levels, and how little they value both their employees and their customers.  As a high school student, I find this book to be extremely relevant to my generation, seeing as how millions of teenagers' first jobs are at fast food joints.  The novel itself is a reasonable length, but the writing itself is hardly sophisticated, as evidenced by the number of typo's in the text.  On the contrary, Schlosser's main strength in this novel is his amount of research that evidently went into his writing.  The novel is packed with statistics, experimental findings, and first-hand interviews with people involved in the fast food industry.  20 pages at the end alone are dedicated to his bibliography.  Many of his interviews with employees of fast food chains and meatpacking factories are very touching and display the level of tragedy thousands of people in this industry face everyday due to lack of health coverage and safety precautions provided by the corporations.  I would highly recommend this novel to a broad audience- in fact anyone who eats fast food on a regular basis should read this so that they become fully informed on what exactly they are putting into their bodies every time they eat fast food.  As a high school student, I found this book to be a worthwhile read, (unlike many other required readings in school) and I believe that it will forever change how I make choices in my diet, which I am sure was the author's intention behind writing this."
398,Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal,0060838582,Eric Schlosser,Barnes and Noble,4.1,WhyAmIUpSoLate,"106 years ago, Upton Sinclair revolutionized the food industry, uncovering the dirty secrets of food production. Fast forward to the present and Eric Schlosser is attempting to once again revolutionize how America eats by exposing the flaws with the fast food industry. He argues that the commercialized industry of fast food has changed how we as Americans live. Schlosser takes the reader on two tours. The first is the oft-repeated success stories of Ray Kroc, the founder McDonalds, and other fast food titans. A glorification of the American success story, this initial tour walks the reader through the story that the fast food industry would like America to hear. Yet this first tour is quickly followed by a disturbing second. Schlosser walks his readers through factories, plants, and warehouses&mdash;the true sources of fast food. He bares all, as he walks readers through olfactory factories. That&rsquo;s right. Factories where smell is fabricated for your Big Mac, fries, and McFlurry. Schlosser exposes a disturbing&mdash;disgusting&mdash;amount of artificiality in every bite of McDonalds, Carl&rsquo;s Jr., or Burger King we take. Certainly, most Americans don&rsquo;t think of fluorescent lit factories, flighty plants, and dusty warehouses when they think of fast food. I know I didn&rsquo;t. Schlosser changed that. He also speaks to the dangers of the fast food industry, both to the consumer and the producer. Dangerous malpractice in factories and plants lead to thousands of injuries, which, Schlosser argues, are the fault of lack of government regulation and intervention. He goes on to interview the victims of work injuries, creating a pathetic portrayal of an apparently flawed industry.

Schlosser&rsquo;s copious amount of statistics, factoids, and research should earn him 5 stars, yet his overtly single sided approach mars what has the potential for a fantastic book. Throughout the piece, Schlosser increasingly points toward government (particularly Republicans) for problems with the fast food industry. He selectively provides facts and statistics to enforce his point, while simply ignoring those that don&rsquo;t. While Schlosser definitely exposes the flaws of fast food America, he fails to objectively present the issue, its root cause, and solution, earning him only 3 out of 5 stars."
398,Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal,0060838582,Eric Schlosser,Barnes and Noble,4.1,CouponToes,"The Book I was reading was Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlosser. This book was a documentary about the food industry and the Fast Food Industry in particular. In the beginning of the book Schlosser is talking more about the history of fast food. He talks about how McDonald's and Carl's Junior and other fast food restaurants are created and how they evolved. The next section of the book is about the where the food you're eating comes from. It talks about the slaughter houses and the danger of working in the meat packing industry. It also tells stories of people getting extremely sick from salmonella. I would definitely recommend this book to another person. It was shocking and gave you the facts without completely bashing the fast food industry which I thought gave this book more integrity. I do think that some people will not be able to appreciate this book. Squeamish people and people that get bored easily will not like this book; however I found most of the book engaging.
	The reason that I say that people that get bored easily wouldn't like this book as much is because of the beginning. It is a little slow getting into the book because the whole first section is mostly a history lesson. It takes a little while to get hooked into the book. Once I got into the sections about the farms and the slaughterhouse and such I was completely hooked, just getting past the first section was a hurdle. The other reason why people might not like this book is because there are some more gory parts in this book. Especially when the slaughterhouse process was being explained. I don't consider myself to have a particularly weak stomach but I became a vegetarian for a couple months. Some people I have talked to on the other hand only wanted a cheeseburger when they read this book. 
	I have to say my favorite part of this book was when Schlosser was in the place where they chemically created smells. Though it was a little disturbing that the smell of feet could be chemically manufacture, it was still intriguing. I'd never heard about anything like it before and I found it incredibly engaging. I never knew that I could get so excited by a book about Fast Food. Another part that I found that made me think was when I was reading about the workers in the slaughterhouse. I found it incredible that these workers were doing ""the most dangerous job"" according to Schlosser, and getting paid next to nothing. I read stories about people getting caught in the grinding machines and falling into the grease and getting hurt or dying. It made me wonder why anyone would want to do these jobs because of the risk and the low pay. I found that many of the workers were immigrants that just needed the money. 
	The thing that I liked most about this book was that it wasn't a snarky book. It didn't say ""Don't eat fast food, it's ruining America!"" I found it refreshing to find a documentary book that didn't tell me what to do because I like forming my own opinions.  I hate it when authors try to force their opinions on me. Schlosser said the facts and stated his opinion as separate things whereas many writers state their opinions as fact. I also liked how Schlosser had a mixture of the facts and stories so that you were less likely to get bored while reading just facts or just his thoughts.
	I would definitely recommend this book. It's subtly progressive so that's not annoying. It was hard to choose favorite parts because there were so many great parts. Though the beginning of"

Rowling,Barnes and Noble,4.2,CloverHillReviews on LibraryThing,"I have to be honest about the cover on this - the Amazon picture on the left really doesn't do it justice at all.  The colour of the hard backed cover of the case is an antique yellow, with very intricate and eye catching illustrations on both sides, and mini illustrations of a couple of the storytelling cards on the middle of the cover.  This review is for the starter storytelling pack.  Additional Storyworld cards are available, (reviews to follow on a couple).This was a pure delight to open.  Both of the Young Reviewers were in awe from the moment they opened the package, which is always a fantastic start!  The top opens like a book; the first half contains a book within it's dvd type cardboard holder, whilst the bottom half contains the 40 gorgeous Storyworld cards.  This is a total work of art from start to finish, and is exceptionally well presented.The idea behind this is so simple, and very worthwhile.  Beautifully illustrated cards are used as prompts to aid in storytelling.  The included storytelling book details how the 40 cards could be used, along with more in depth ideas for each of them.  On the reverse of each card is a brief description, along with three questions to help storytellers to use them as an aid in their stories.  Each card is stunning.  That's the only word that describes them for me.The cards have enough detail to help even the most shyest storyteller want to have a go.  I can say this confidently as a parent. Our youngest reviewer who's 4, loves stories. He loves listening to them and preempting what is coming - as long as he knows the story. Since these arrived, every night he's not just wanted stories.  He's wanted to *make* stories and rushes upstairs in anticipation of it!  I love it.  Whilst I'm not suggesting all children will behave in this way, Storyworld is becoming a fantastic part of our evening, and has brought everything from fairies to knights and rainbows into our childrens imagination and storytelling.  It's giving them the confidence to think about how a story is made up, to learn from each other, and to share, whilst encouraging them to expand on their skills.I haven't used the book that came with the cards much at the moment, I didn't want to be too rigid.  It's worked well so far and the cards are so detailed we've all found a new story to tell (and yes, us adults take part too each evening).  For usability these are great.  As a parent I always look for value for money in things we use regularly...this has by far exceeded my expectations, and there's a lot more stories to come yet!In summary, this is truly stunning, with beautiful illustrations on each and every of the 40 tell your own story cards, presented in a book presentation format and ready to use, alongside a storytelling book. Storyworld provides the inspiration. The only thing needed is a tiny bit of imagination and you're away.A few words from Harry, 4:I like all of it! A few words from Shaun, 8:Very, very, very good.  I like being able to make up my own stories using the cards."

What can you say about a book that launched an entire sub-genre of literature? With a breakthrough image of the future that we become a little closer to each day, William Gibson has inspired his fellow authors, futurists, and tech guru's since the day it was published.

I believe that the movie was just absolutely fantastic and amazing and any other adjective that I can think of (Just not at the moment). So, I picked up this book from the library to see what it was all about.It was pretty good basically sums it up. It had innovative settings and ideas and was generally awesome all around, but I just didn't like how sometimes certain technologies were never explained or were only barely mentioned. That's fine if it is just mentioned in passing, but when you linger on them and detail them without saying what they actually do, that kind of frustrated me.Other than that, this book was what I like to call perfect. Everything about it was expertly crafted and written, and I highly recommend it to people interested in cyperbunk or just basic science fiction. I will be getting a copy for my own library."
400,Neuromancer,0441569595,William Gibson,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Kilroy6644,"For years I'd heard about what a great book this is, and how it was one of the defining novels of cyberpunk. Unfortunately, I was not interested in cyberpunk, or Neuromancer. Recently, however, my attitude changed, and decided to pick it up. I'm sorry I waited so long.

Neuromancer is, almost 30 years after it was published, still refreshingly original. Having read it, I can see the influence it's had on other books and movies, yet it feels different from all of its ""offspring."" Now that I've finished it, what began as a passing interest, ""to see what it's all about,"" has grown into a deep fascination, and I'm looking forward to picking up more of Gibson's books."
401,A Farewell to Arms,0099910101,Ernest Hemingway,Barnes and Noble,3.8,dhaupt,"First published in 1929 when Hemingway was 30 A Farewell to Arms is viewed through the eyes of an American serving in the Italian army during the WW1, his love of one woman and his eventual life on the run. We today are used to the prose like, flowing dialogue of contemporary authors, so I was at first un-prepared for Hemingway's staccato, and very pragmatic verse, he puts us on the front lines with the soldiers and shows us how life away from the front was spent. He tells us of medical procedures of the time, procedures that we view as expectant as an aspirin, but in his day were life saving and sometimes life taking techniques. He takes us on an unequaled journey from the Mountains to the small villages and finally to the cities of Italy and ends our voyage in a small village in Switzerland. He takes us behind enemy lines and in the trenches of allies and he does it with an amazing proficiency. His characters are unforgettable in their portrayals from his protagonist Frederic and his love interest Catherine to his comrades in arms. His love story is poignant and heartwarming and tragic and yet beautiful in it's telling. He was truly a masterful narrator.
So come back to the classic tale of love found and love lost, of war and desertion and of human frailty. Come back and see why this tale has survived a number of reprints and almost a century in time. Come back and make Papa proud. Come back and read the one and only A Farewell to Arms."
401,A Farewell to Arms,0099910101,Ernest Hemingway,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Etienne,"Hemingway's ""A Farewell To Arms"" is an absolute necessity in order to understand the time in which it takes place. The dichotomy between love and war is an idea explored in depth in the novel. The novel paints a picture of war as pointless, confused, and without victor. Though it lacks an uplifting ending to say the least, this piece of literature is one that deserves a permanent spot on your bookshelf."
401,A Farewell to Arms,0099910101,Ernest Hemingway,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Anonymous,"In my opinion, 'A Farewell to Arms' is a book worth reading.  One strong point about this book is the straight-forward, and realistic writing style.  Hemingway wrote small, yet descriptive sentences that attract's the reader.  Unlike, most other authors, who take a number of pagers to describe one simple thing.  Hemingway keep's the reader's mind going.
Though the overall writing content was execellent, there are small parts of the book that give it negatve reviews.  The 'supposed' love between the main characters, in my own opinion felt dull, and not very realistic.  The ending is a surprise for the reader.  But dispute it being hated for having a depressing ending, it's very memorable and understandable.  This book doesn't have a typical 'happy ending' because unlike most books it's realistic.  'A Farewell to Arms' is overall a wonderful book to read."

403,The Art of War,1590302257,"Sun Tzu, Thomas Cleary",Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"I have to say, this is the best interpretation of Sun Tzu¿s classic work I have read. The author focuses on the meanings behind this ancient Chinese war philosopher¿s writings. He puts them into a modern context, making them easy to understand. Sun Tzu's treatise on The Art of War is really a treatise on competitive advantage that applies not only to actual war but such things as getting a job, marketing, and any other competitive situation that you might come across. A deep understanding of competitive advantage, it is still the definitive text for understanding the concepts of how to come out on top in such situations. An easy book to read and understand on a basic level, it can take a lifetime to truly appreciate in on all levels and apply it to the various areas of your life. This translation still seems to be one of the best that I have seen. It is internally consistent between the translated concepts and so shows a level of knowledge and detail that is not present in some other translations. As a translator the author obviously sees the big picture. The Art of War contains both the complete translated text of Sun Tzu's enduring classic on battle strategy, and a modern-day interpretation packed with advice on leadership, learning to keep one's intentions a secret from one's opponents, leveraging advantages as the key to victory, and a great deal more. An excellent resource for anyone seeking self-improvement through internalizing Sun Tzu's wisdom, the Art of War is thoughtful and thought-provoking reading of the highest order.    I don¿t think 'The Art of War' was meant to be a moral guide in the strict sense that we attribute to morality in Western civilization, in this particular era. In my opinion, Sun Tzu summarized all his personal experience on tactics and strategy (and perhaps other people's experience, too) in order to write a concise, logical and solid military manual. Military history is one of my biggest personal interests, and I've seen that it is possible to adapt Sun Tzu's ideas to most historical battlefields and eras. Not only does 'The Art of War' deal with maneuvers and tactics in the battlefield, it addresses everything a commander should take into account prior to engaging battle: logistics, intelligence, terrain, morale and last, but not least, the psychological understanding of the opponent. As I mentioned above, 'The Art of War' cannot be seen as guidance for the ethics and morality of our acts, nonetheless, it is a valuable instrument when it comes down to overcome daily life difficulties, it helps focus problems in such a way they can be solved systematically. And when it comes to use such knowledge against individuals, personal foes, it's important to keep on mind that it's best to beat an enemy without actually fighting  overkill is not the best outcome most of the times."
403,The Art of War,1590302257,"Sun Tzu, Thomas Cleary",Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"This is not merely a military or tactical manual - this is a book of pure wisdom. Sun Tzu was way ahead of his time in creating such an extraordinary guide to strategy and leadership, both in and out of combat. Read this book once, then read it again  the advice and aphorisms that flow from it are infinite each time."

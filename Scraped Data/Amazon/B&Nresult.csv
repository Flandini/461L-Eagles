1,"The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games, #1)",0439023483,Suzanne Collins,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Anonymous,"There's really not much to say other than I just read a book that was equal part disturbing and completely compelling. 
I can't even say how much this book effected me, both emotionally and physically. (I bought a bow and arrow set. No kidding.)
I think this is a book that will stick with me for a very long time. 
Caution: It's violent and a lot of parts are very unsettling, but if you can get through it, it's really an amazing read. Opens your mind, for sure.
I can't wait for the sequel."
1,"The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games, #1)",0439023483,Suzanne Collins,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Sarah_R,"When I got my copy of the Hunger Games as an advanced, I devoured it in less than a day. It's one of those ""can't put down even if it's 3 in the morning"" type of books. I knew, quickly, it would be a recommendation I'd offer to ANYone looking for a great, new teen read. What I liked most about the book is its premise: in a maybe-distant-not-distinguishable future, Katniss, our heroine, finds herself participating in the ultimate reality TV show--a fight to the death. For teenagers in Katniss's world, a lottery could send them to the Capitol to fight in these Hunger Games, where the victor is the last teen standing. With a little romance, humor among the carnage, and an interesting new future set up, Collins' first book of the Hunger Games series is unforgettable."
2,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Harry Potter, #1)",0439554934,"J.K. Rowling, Mary GrandPr??",Barnes and Noble,4.6,Guest,"So I refused to read Harry Potter for years. I saw the first two movies, and lost my interest. I could never understand the hype surrounding this children's book. Then the book Seven came out, and all my seemingly mature, professional friends stormed the bookstores, locking themselves in their apartments for four days, emerging with a glow unparalleled to any I have seen.        A sheep that I am, I decided to not stand out and bought the first Harry Potter book. A day later I emerged from my dwelling, smile on my face and a need to read more about Harry. Whoever said that Harry was for kids only? For shame!      J.K. Rowling is one of those rare novelists who write flawlessly, capturing imagination, hopes and dreams, addressing children and adults alike. Great story line, clear messages and a whole new world to explore are just some of the attributes of the first Harry Potter. Harry, a wizard by birth and unaware of it, is 11 and living with his mother's sister and her family. An orphan, Harry is treated as such in a very Dickensonian way by his adopted family, who detests Harry for being different. That all changes when Harry starts attending Hogwarts, a school for wizards and witches, where a whole new world unfolds before him. The new school is not without dangers, and Harry learns the truth about his parents' deaths, as well as about the lightning shaped scar on his own forehead that made Harry a celebrity in the world of witchcraft.       A fantastic novel that kept me yearning for more. And thankfully, there IS more. Highly recommeded."

2,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Harry Potter, #1)",0439554934,"J.K. Rowling, Mary GrandPr??",Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"This book pulled me in from the beginning, when Harry was placed on the doorstep. I barely put it down. J.K. Rowling creates a magical world and you feel like you are Harry because you are experiencing Hogwarts for the first time, like him. Even though they are not normal experiences, you feel kind of like him, just thrust in. Thoroughly well written and very enjoyable."

3,"Twilight (Twilight, #1)",0316015849,Stephenie Meyer,Barnes and Noble,4.5,FairyDust90,"I had heard about this book from one of my sister's friends and I never thought anything of it. Then two of my closest friends started RAVING about this book so I decided to look it up. I read the first chapter online and was hooked. I quickly bought the first one and I could not put it down. You really grow to love and care for Bella, Edward, and the whole Cullen family. They each have their own personalities which you also grow to love. Twilight is exactly my type of heroine!"

4,To Kill a Mockingbird,0061120081,Harper Lee,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"When I first looked at the book ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" I thought that it looked like a boring old book that I was going to be forced to read. I was one hundred percent positive that I would not like it one bit. But by the time I was on the 6th chapter I could not put it down. This book was amazing. Although it was written through the eyes of a six-year-old girl it is a very deep book. The concept of racism and prejudice in this book was shown perfectly through the eyes of Scout. The innocence that the victims, Tom Robinson and Boo Radley, showed was clear throughout the whole book. I enjoyed this book for several reasons. One is the fact that even though Harper Lee wrote this book in 1960 the book opened my eyes to the fact that the concept of racism and prejudice is still happening today. This was an interesting glimpse into this subject for me because I live in a very diverse community and all of my friends and peers are pretty tolerant of each others' differences. Reading this book taught me that racism could affect everyone.  Using interesting characters and getting me involved in their personal stories made the issues of civil rights and racism more real to me. Usually when you have to read about racism it involves dates in a history book and people you can't relate to, but ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" was written in a way that was easy to read and more people can relate to Scout and her family. I also liked this book because it showed how growing up is an important and inevitable part of life. At some point you can't shelter children from every bad thing in the world that comes along. In the story, Atticus eventually had to sit down with Jem and Scout and explain to them about bigotry and what was going on in their community.  He understood that they were growing up and, in turn, he set an example of what a good person was like. I liked how even though the book was written through Scout's eyes, Harper Lee still was able to catch how Jem was affected by having Scout observe the changes in her brother and talk to her Dad about it.  Even though the book touches on more mature ideas and concepts, I feel that this book is a sure hit for all ages. This book is a true classic and unquestionably deserved the Pulitzer Prize."
4,To Kill a Mockingbird,0061120081,Harper Lee,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Renelche,"This is such a moving book.  It is rich with southern texture.  A coming of age tale in the Depression Era south, the book speaks to people today as much as it did when it was written.  Every time I read it, I find that it tells me more about children, adults, feelings, and how we deal with one another as people.  I also find that, each time I read it, I am uplifted."

5,The Great Gatsby,0743273567,F. Scott Fitzgerald,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Artazen,"Want to buy. Will not. YOU CAN NOT JUSTIFY CHARGING THIS PRICE FOR THIS BOOK. CAN NOT. I HATE having to complain but this trend of jacking up prices for our computer file nooks is becoming common practice and is an insult to the intelligence of every nook/nookcolor owner. And we can't use our discount card for what reason. We want to be loyal customers. Please inspire us to do so. If you did not know, we want quality nookbooks and apps at fair prices. If you are a fellow nook owner and see an example of nookbook price abuse, add a comment to your review. Or not."
5,The Great Gatsby,0743273567,F. Scott Fitzgerald,Barnes and Noble,4.1,leehoove,"Though the ending isn't Disney-worthy (my usual preference), Fitzgerald did a marvelous job.  The book centers around the mysterious character of Gatsby, and, as you turn the pages, his history unravels before your eyes, as well as the narrator's--Nick.  Nick is an ""average"" guy whom we feel we can trust--because he follows his father's advice and does not immediately judge (or so he says).  The book will make you yearn for a love you know is impossible, cringe with embarrassment at a shameful past, blush at the awkwardness encountered on nearly every page, laugh and cry at the dramatic irony, and have you researching the Charleston (the dance, not the city--this is set in the 1920s, after all!). It may not be considered a typical love story, but the electricity between Daisy and Gatsby is too strong to deny and it always has me wondering what will happen (though I know).  Read for irony, read for lessons, read to be taken back to another time--no, another dimension in which the music never dies and the party is perpetual."
5,The Great Gatsby,0743273567,F. Scott Fitzgerald,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"Too expensive! I was planning to buy, but I will look for a hard copy. If you want happy nook owners, dont overcharge for classics!"
6,The Fault in Our Stars,0525478817,John Green,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Shaun_Rice,"Let's face it: Cancer is a popular topic among the literary world, both in fiction and non-fiction. For years, authors have penned the tumultuous lives of those affected by cancer, as well as the lives of those who know people with cancer. I have been following Green's work for several years now, and I have been consistently impressed with the work he has done. However, his previous novels have always fallen short of excellence, something that has changed with the Young Adult author's newest outing. The Fault in Our Stars is wonderful. Plain and simple. Too often ""cancer books"" are downtrodden with overemotional drama that saturates the reading experience with misery. Fortunately, this book changes that. The tone of the book is primarily humorous, as is Green's specialty, and does not dwell excessively on drama. That does not mean, however, that the severity of the characters' situation is ignored. Rather, the cancer is more of a supporting character, always hovering around our narrator, but never entirely interfering with the flow of the story. The cancer simply exists, and while it makes itself known, it does not do so loudly. This offers a nice change of pace for those accustomed to the achingly detailed books about cancer and hospice they might have read in the past. Most importantly, the characters are not the wise and all-knowing cancer kids that is common in many stories of young people suffering with the disease. They offer their perspective, but they are scarcely blatant about it. Hazel, our narrator, offers often amusing observations about the world she lives in as well as the situation she has found herself in, but she is not and does not claim to be an all-knowing book of infinite knowledge. The same is to be said about Gus, our heroic best friend. While the story lacks extravagance, that doesn't stop it from becoming one of the best novels I've read in recent memory. It is a stubborn little book, and will not be easily forgotten like so many other books lining the bookshelves of the present. The prose is quiet and minimal, while still retaining a sort of muted beauty. The dialogue is sharp and witty. The characters are well-drawn out, and you might even find yourself wanting to hug the venerable (and fictional) author Peter Van Houten by the end of the book. In conclusion: Whether you have enjoyed Green's previous works or are familiar with his on-going YouTube phenomenon, you will certainly enjoy The Fault in Our Stars. It's a fantastic book filled with fantastic characters, and is written by a fantastic author. This is destined to be one of the best books of the year, and should not be missed."
6,The Fault in Our Stars,0525478817,John Green,Barnes and Noble,4.6,-Hagen-,"This book is not only for the young set. There is great benefit to all who read this. It&rsquo;s not only about two teens battling cancer; it&rsquo;s about a lesson to all of us to live our lives every day, every minute. We should be thankful for this time especially if we are lucky enough to find love and be capable of giving. This story is beautiful, funny, heartbreaking and poignant. Gus and Hazel made me laugh, cry, laugh all over again, and cry yet again. I&rsquo;m still crying!"
6,The Fault in Our Stars,0525478817,John Green,Barnes and Noble,4.6,elschneider,"I prolonged reading this one. I knew it was going to be good - not only because of the rave reviews I'd been hearing, but also because the subject matter was a tough one to tackle. And yet, I let it sit in my TBR pile for three months, while I stalled and read other books.

cancer touches many lives, and everyone deals with it differently. cancer touched my life in June of 2006, when my mom was diagnosed with late-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (cancer of the liver). It was predicted she'd have anywhere between four to six months, and that was with all the surgeries, chemo, and whatever else they could throw her way. Proving the doctors wrong and opting out of all Western medicines and treatments, she gave us four wonderful years.

In exactly two weeks from today, it will have been two years since my mom passed away. And maybe it's the timing, that caused me to finally pick up THE FAULT IN OUR STARS and start reading the first page of a book, I secretly think I'd been dreading to read all-together.

But what I found amongst those pages, was an exceptional story - and while beautifully written, it was tremendously bittersweet. Anyone who has had even a glimpse into this devastating disease, can completely relate to how raw and heartbreaking this journey truly was.

The relationship between Hazel and Augustus from start to finish, was nothing short of believable - full of emotion, yet flavored throughout with well-timed humor, as the two made their way through such unfortunate circumstances. Neither of them gave credit to their cancer - it simply was what it was, and they both dealt with the hand they were given, in the best way they knew how.

You may have noticed (or not?) that I didn't capitalize the c in the word cancer, anywhere above - and that's because I don't believe it deserves that kind of credit or attention. One day we'll figure out how this horrible disease takes over the human body, metastasizes throughout, and ultimately, takes the ones we love. And we'll stop it. Until then, it's exceptional books like THE FAULT IN OUR STARS that makes you realize, it doesn't matter who you are or what your age is, in the end, cancer affects us all.

John Green is a master at story-telling; a true artist in the way he delivered a journey that could have gone in a non-favorable direction, all too easily. A FAULT IN OUR STARS was an excellent read and a favorite YA contemporary for me - this is one I highly recommend to everyone."
7,The Hobbit,0618260307,J.R.R. Tolkien,Barnes and Noble,4.5,ExtraBitterStoat,"I've loved the Hobbit for a long time, and was excited to see an eBook version come out.  ""Finally, I can read it on my Nook"", I thought.  I was extremely disappointed in some of the choices of the formatters.  Tolkien's illustrations are included, but are reduced to a postage stamp size, for some reason.  The Nook screen has a very high resolution, and the illustrations should take advantage of it!  The illustrations even look terrible on the tiny iPhone screen.  Also, for some reason, the lines of verse are irregularly spaced.  Sometimes you'll get 5 stanzas on the screen, sometimes two or three with bizarre spacing.  If I'm paying for a product, I expect a professional look and consistent formatting!"
7,The Hobbit,0618260307,J.R.R. Tolkien,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,This is a fabulous edition of the Hobbit.  We purchased it for our family library.  My children loved the illustrations.  It is a bit pricy - but a wonderful addition to any collection.
7,The Hobbit,0618260307,J.R.R. Tolkien,Barnes and Noble,4.5,GVSreading,"The Hobbit (the prelude to the Lord of the Rings) starts out great and never goes downhill from there. When it starts out with a three foot tall person being thrown out of his home with nothing, and coming back the richest person in his country, it will almost always be a great book.
  In the beginning a hobbit named Bilbo gets thrown out of his home and goes on an adventure.  The following exert is Gandalf the wizard getting Bilbo out the door. ""But. """"No time for that!"" ""But.""""No time for that either!""   He then goes on a fantastic journey with talking spiders, goblins, greedy elves, and..riddles.  That last part may not make sense, but it will when you read it and decide it is an incredible book.
  I think it is an occasionally funny, exciting, fantasy genre adventure story.  It sprinkles in humor sparingly at good points in the story.  It is not a book I would recommend for those below eleven or twelve years of age.
 The Hobbit is, in my opinion, an incredible read that should be worth a look from everyone.
 The Hobbit is the greatest book I have ever read, and a true classic.  If you like The Lord of the Rings movies, you will love this book.  When I set it down, I was captivated by its story, and its incredible quality."
8,The Catcher in the Rye,0316769177,J.D. Salinger,Barnes and Noble,4.2,CC19,"J.D. Salinger's coming of age novel The Catcher in the Rye has delightfully captured the attention of readers for decades.  Its popularity is primarily, but not exclusively, due to the realism behind the plot, characters, and themes.  Although the story takes place during the late 1940s, teenagers everywhere can still relate to the sixteen year old protagonist, Holden Caulfield.  The combination of his criticism, bitterness, and pessimism towards society was carefully crafted to create Holden as a unique narrator with many conflicting thoughts.  In fact, Holden feels so torn between becoming an adult and staying a child that he essentially alienates himself from those who have conformed to one or the other.  The distress and confusion of growing up is the underlying theme that follows Holden throughout the entire novel.
From just the first chapter of the novel readers come to learn that Holden is not your typical adolescent boy.  He does not hold back when criticizing his ""phony"" schoolmates, whose obsessions include girls, sex, smoking, and drinking.  Although Holden feels compelled to engage in the latter two activities himself, he does not necessarily agree with it.  He is merely trying to find a medium between childhood and adulthood.  Feeling alone and isolated, Holden carries out the extreme by leaving his prep school to escape those around him already engrossed in maturing into adults.  The story follows with a number of events that all contribute to Holden's intriguing journey to understanding himself; a journey many young people in the world today go on themselves.  
Because Salinger's themes are so universal yet realistic, The Catcher in the Rye is found to be satisfying and relatable to all types of readers.  Holden and his struggles bring each reader back to a time in their own lives when they were going through a drastic change.  For that reason The Catcher in the Rye can easily be considered timeless.  The thought of keeping this novel off libraries' shelves because of its vulgar language, sexual references, and so-called promotion of drug use is ludicrous.  Do not let the accusations and believers of censorship keep you from becoming immersed into the world of Holden Caulfield."
8,The Catcher in the Rye,0316769177,J.D. Salinger,Barnes and Noble,4.2,JRews,"I read this book this year for school, I was in a bad mood and I ended up reading half of it in one night. Its a book that's so easy to understand, its so human. There's no action or any thrill much at all besides the everyday life of Holden Caulfield. I recommend this book to anyone who's human. Its enjoyable and relatable. Also, I love the Holden."
8,The Catcher in the Rye,0316769177,J.D. Salinger,Barnes and Noble,4.2,KLJoy,"The novel ""The Catcher in the Rye"" by J.D. Salinger was written in 1951. However, it is still being read in schools today. Unlike many timeless novels, ""The Catcher in the Rye"" not only provides a strong message that still resonates today, it also is a fascinating, creative piece of writing. 
""The Catcher in the Rye"" takes place in the 1940s and tells the story of Holden Caulfield, a troubled teenager haunted by the death of his little brother. The story follows Holden as he runs away from private school while hoping to find to find happiness somewhere in the streets of New York. Holden is both the protagonist and antagonist of his story. He is stubborn, rude, and judgmental without a cause. On the other hand, Holden loves his little sister and wants to protect children from the world around them. He is broken and in search of something he can't seem to find. He is searching for love. When his brother died, Holden lost someone who loved him. Even though Holden couldn't see the love depart, he feels it slipping away. Holden's parents are too caught up in their own pain to recognize that Holden is struggling. Holden is forced to bear all of his burdens by himself. It is this struggle that makes the novel timeless. In essence we are all Holden, a little lost and a little broken, but always pushing forward, looking for a glimmer of happiness in the distance. Everyone knows the feeling of being in a place where everyone else belongs. Anyone can relate to Holden's struggle to find himself in a place where people look down on those who differ from the status quo.  ""The Catcher in the Rye"" makes the experience both poignant and humorous. Holden is a teenage boy whose thoughts are often ludicrous and socially incorrect. J.D. Salinger knew that there was more to writing a novel then just getting the message across. He accomplishes it with comedy and intrigue. It is hard not to laugh when Holden is lying to a women about his age while calling those around him phonies. ""The Catcher in the Rye"" is a classic because it would remain a talented piece of writing even without a moral ""point"". The novel merges timeless and engaging with an effortlessness that many authors can't achieve."
9,"Angels & Demons  (Robert Langdon, #1)",1416524797,Dan Brown,Barnes and Noble,4.4,ticareader,"I reluctantly picked this book up. I had read the DaVinci Code really just to see what the big fuss was, but never finished it. Dan Brown redeemed himself with this one. I could not put it down. I love fast paced books and this one definitely is that...now I have to decide if I'll ruin it all by watching the movie, but we'll see."
9,"Angels & Demons  (Robert Langdon, #1)",1416524797,Dan Brown,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Dave2012,"Robert Langdon and Vittoria Vetra combine to create an amazing story-line with many twists, turns, and surprises in Dan Brown¿s Angels and Demons.  This book has a fair amount of fabrication, along with a number of true, while unknown facts, all of which combine with first-rate and competent characters to create a never failing, addictive novel.     In Vatican City, Rome an ancient and thought-to-be-extinct demonic brotherhood emerges to declare science¿s jurisdiction over religion.  While the brotherhood of the Illuminati is factual, this conspiracy and attack are completely fictional.  Brown¿s interlinking of these two very distinct elements combine into a woven quilt, creating the story of Angels and Demons.     Robert Langdon is a world-renowned Harvard symbologist called to Switzerland¿s Conseil Europ&#233;en pour la Recherche Nucl&#233;aire facility (CERN) to scrutinize a corpse branded with an Illuminati ambigram.  Langdon¿s brilliance connects with Vittoria Vetra¿s common sense to create a kind of juggernaut against the terror of the brotherhood.  This well-rounded team is prone to penetrate the protected Illuminati.     Angels and Demons is a great book that I would recommend to anyone interested.  I am a freshman in High School and had no problem with any of the vocabulary in the story.  I was also intrigued instantaneously and addicted by the third or fourth chapter.  The other great thing about this book is that it is not so predictable that you can tell exactly what is going to happen.  But it does not make you think ¿Where on Earth is this going?¿ and no one likes this.  The novel mixes elements well and creates an entertaining story that I would advise to everyone."
9,"Angels & Demons  (Robert Langdon, #1)",1416524797,Dan Brown,Barnes and Noble,4.4,unknowing-savior,"Unfortunately, I read Da Vinci Code first, then went back to Angels and Demons.  What I noticed was that the style was identical and the characters were similar and the plot was quite parallel.  It was almost like reading the same book back to back.  Neither book was badly written, it's just that the style showed no variety and read back to back was a let down."
10,Pride and Prejudice,0679783261,Jane Austen,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Alyssa2010,"I recently read Pride and Prejudice to relax, and I can honestly say that it is one of the best novels I have ever read. The characters of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are well developed and enthralling. Elizabeth is the classic stubborn and brazen heroine; a no nonsense kind of girl whose personality from their first meeting rubs Mr. Darcy the wrong way. Through several different personal struggles we see these characters grow as individuals, as well as closer to each other. It is a must read for all the hopeless romantics out there."
10,Pride and Prejudice,0679783261,Jane Austen,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"'It is a truth universally acknowledged that any man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of...' a copy of Pride and Prejudice. I had felt guilty that I had watched many film versions of the book before actually reading it. That being said, I grabbed a copy at Barnes and Noble and ran home to read. I'll admit that the language of Jane Austen's day can be a bit confusing at first, but after the first three chapters, I was transported to eighteenth century England, sipping tea, and watching Elizabeth bedazzle Fitzwilliam while dancing at the Netherfield ball. This is a definite must-read for any, true booklover. Bon appetit!"
10,Pride and Prejudice,0679783261,Jane Austen,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"This is a scan of the 1894 George Allen edition.  There are a lot of problems with the scanner software not being able to recognize letters, or maybe the document was just dirty, but you have to do a lot of guessing as to the words. A difficult read and not for those who have not read Pride and Prejudice before this."
11,The Kite Runner,1594480001,Khaled Hosseini,Barnes and Noble,4.6,songcatchers,"The Kite Runner takes place in both Afghanistan and California. It's told from the perspective of Amir, first as a little boy and later on as a man. Amir grows up a privileged boy in Afghanistan. His best friend is Hassan, the son of the family servant. Amir is Pashtun, Hassan is Hazara. Amir is Sunni, Hassan is Shi'a. Their differences don't change the fact that these boys were breastfed together, learned to crawl together and are basically inseparable. Then everything changes. Amir witnesses a horror done to Hassan and cannot forgive himself for not stepping in to help him and to do what is right. In 1975 Afghanistan is in turmoil and Amir, then 12 years old, and his father move to San Francisco. Amir grows up feeling guilt and self-hatred over the issue with Hassan and the subsequent results. Then one day, twenty five years after Amir has left Afghanistan, he receives a phone call summoning him back to the place he had hoped to forget. The caller tells Amir ""there is a way to be good again.""The Kite Runner has for it's hero a very flawed human being.....but that's what makes him so believable. Amir the boy does a very cowardly, dastardly deed but Amir the man stands up to the Taliban and even more importantly, he stands up for what is right. This book has forgiveness, redemption and courage for it's main themes. We see how strong the ties of friendship and loyalty can become through the eyes of Amir and a broken little Afghan boy. The setting in Kabul and the culture of the Afghan people make for an interesting backdrop to an unforgettable novel."
11,The Kite Runner,1594480001,Khaled Hosseini,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Debbie-J-1970,"The story is tragic and heart rending. At some points I really disliked the main character, but I could relate with his frustrations and guilt. He redeemed himself with his bravery in the end. The characters are deep, and the interactions between them are as natural as if the author had witnessed them himself (or, indeed, experienced them!). There is a little bit of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn in the main character and his hair-lipped friend, respectively. I loved how many plot threads from the main character's childhood came back to him in adulthood, which brought back all the main character's childhood anxieties. I have never known a thing about Afghanistan, except what I hear on the news, but this book brought that beautiful, beleaguered country to life for me in ways I never could have imagined. I was transported to and immersed in a world that is totally beyond the awareness of most westerners. Through Hosseini's magic, I became part of that world and literally felt young Amir's and Hassan's every feeling. A superb novel, both historical and relevant for our times. This is a well written novel that's very culturally and politically aware, and it is certainly worth the time."
11,The Kite Runner,1594480001,Khaled Hosseini,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"I was given this book about two years ago and it sat on my shelf until now, and I cant believe I didnt read it sooner. I cried, I laughed, and feel in to deep thought throughout this whole book. Its beautiful and you will fall in love with the characters right away. Hassan was my favorite character and you will love him too. I cried so much throughout this book because it evoked such feeling inside of me, do yourself a favor and BUY THE BOOK!"

It's been a while since I was so captivated by a book it was in my hand everywhere I went. I started this book early in the morning and refused to put it down until finished. I fell into the rhythm of Tris' voice and was surrounded by this dystopian world she lives in. From beginning to end you find yourself holding your breath in amazement of where this story is taking you. I will be recommending this title to all of my customers!!

12,"Divergent (Divergent, #1)",0062024035,Veronica Roth,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"This book blew my mind. Some people say that this is the new Hunger Games, but I personally think it's better. I have never read a book that literally stunned me, for a minute after I finished reading it i just sat there basking in the amazingness of this book. I loved the characters (especially Four) and the plot was wonderful. My ultimate favorite part of this book was Tris' voice. The way she narrates the book make it unlike any book I have read, but not at all in a bad way. The only thing that bugged me was the ending. The book is about 480-500 pages long, with the ending being about 50 pages. To me the ending didn't seem complete, but that is probably because it's a series and if the ending seems complete then no one will buy the next book. My ultimate favorite part of this book was Tris' voice. The way she narrates the book make it unlike any book I have read, but not at all in a bad way. All in all i can not wait until the next book in this trilogy comes out."

Having read it I can see how it has become regarded as classic fiction. Of course the year 1984 has come and gone and many folks say had it been titled ""2009"" it would have been much more accurate.
For those of you who haven't read it, it is a complex novel but with a fairly basic plot. The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a functioning member of a society in the future who meets a woman he is attracted to. Much of the book surrounds their attempt to form a relationship in this society that just won't allow that sort of thing. Of course the real point and value of the novel is to illustrate where our current society may be headed if we don't change course, a sort of anti-utopian (dystopian?) novel. This book has brought us common terms such as ""Big Brother"", ""doublethink"", and ""thought police."" There are long sections where Winston reads to his girl friend from the official government manual detailing how the society came to be as well as the evolution of the government-speak (""Newspeak"") language. I am glad that I've read this novel but at the same time I can't say that I would ever want to read it again. My political/societal views are already pretty much cemented in place and this book, while thought provoking, did not change my views. I do agree that it should be studied at the High School level though, not only for its value to the world of literature but also as a way to kick start young people's thinking on what a society should and shouldn't be. 
Essentially 1984 presents a juggernaut state that has become unmoored from whatever benign ideals once berthed it and has drifted off beyond site of a reassuring oasis-like coastline. A state in which its inhabitants no longer strive to achieve their original goals be they based on economical, religious or political ideals and have allowed the state to become a living entity in itself with the destruction of the human spirit as its sole aim.
 
Be sure to watch the three different movies made from this book:
1984 (1954) Peter Cushing is Winston Smith
1984 (1956) Edmond O'Brien is Winston Smith
Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984) John Hurt is Winston Smith"
13,1984,0451524934,"George Orwell, Erich Fromm, Cel??l ??ster",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"I am a high school student. This was not a required reading peice for me. I saw it sitting in Barnes and Noble on a shelf with suggeseted reading. When I first started reading the book it was BORING! I had to force myself to go on. After about the first hundred pages though, it started to get interesting. The story is ok, but this is a book you shouldn't be reading for just the plot. There is so much more to it than the plot. Every person who reads this book will get a different meaning from it.    To me this book says that peoples minds can be molded very easily. Even the strong can be made weak after a certain amount of torture. Perhaps this is a negative thought, but it started me thinking on a much larger scale. I owe a lot of things to this book. I think more clearly since I read this book. I think about more important things, things most 16 yr olds wouldn't think of. This book has truely shown me the light towards literature so to speak.    Whether you are required to read this or not, I think you should. If you have already read it, read it again. I'm sure 10 years from now the book will have a deeper meaning. I can't wait to read it again and find out what those meanings will be."
13,1984,0451524934,"George Orwell, Erich Fromm, Cel??l ??ster",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"I came to 1984 after reading a series of novels by Russian authors about life in Stalingrad during the onslaught by Hitler and then after the cruelty of Stalin. It's easy to see how Orwell extended the grim realities of the concentration camps of Germany and the labor camps of Russia into this dark prophecy. Of course, in many instances his vision has become realized. Big Brother seeks to invade our privacy at every turn via electronic media. Governments pose rhetoric immersed in 'doublespeak'. The Thought Police exist to bully our free expression. Power is exercised by imposing real human suffering upon multitudes. 'The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent.' Oil comes to mind here. And munitions. And diverse other commodities. In 1984 the war is endless. 'Everywhere there is the same pyramidical structure, the same worship of a semi-divine leader, the same economy existing by and for continuous war.' Sound familiar? The High, or the 'priests of power' only fall when assaulted by the Middle and usually assisted by the Low classes. Then the Middle becomes the High and oppresses the Low for which change only means a new master. The protagonist, Winston, a 'minority of one' questions his own sanity but ultimately defends the 'spirit of man' as a force which cannot be overpowered. In the closing pages we see Orwell's true convictions about the infallible power of Big Brother and the triumph of the human spirit. This dark view has real overtones of Nietzsche and Machiavelli, who wrote with the view of realism based upon the inhumanity they witnessed in their heydays by 'princes' with the 'will to power'. But the 'spirit of man' is truly formidable and cannot be overcome, except temporarily, by totalitarian figures and corrupt democracies. The next US national election will be telling about down which road America will travel. 1984 is a cautionary, post-World War II tale but to say it's unrealistically dark and couldn't happen here and now is to overlook eons of history. And to be unconscious of the powers of orthodoxy infringing greedily and corporately upon the spirit of man in our time."
14,Animal Farm,0452284244,George Orwell,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Maria_of_amor,"Animal Farm is about the animals on a farm uprising and throwing out their unjust owner in order to run the place themselves. It is a thinly-veiled jab at tyrannical regimes and succeeds tremendously. I breezed through this one and honestly could find nothing wrong with it. The characters are all believable and quite a few are even highly likable. My favorite is the horse Boxer who is renowned for his strength, both of body and character. You have to kind of suspend your disbelief when reading Animal Farm because of some of the things that happen, but it is well worth it. The animals decide that the humans get all of the benefit for their hard work and they are tired of it. Led by two pigs, Napoleon and Snowball, they overthrow the humans. I won't give a bunch of spoilers, but the story unfolds in such a way as to show how a dictatorship comes to be and how the animals went from one form of slavery to another. I also think the character Squealer was done extremely well as far a propaganda man(pig). By the end of the tale, you can see and understand everything that has transpired and the moral stands on its own without you needing to be bashed over the head with it. For a great fairy-tale about the dangers of socialism or any other kind of bad government ending with ""ism"", look no further than Animal Farm, where ""All animals are created equal, but some are more equal than others."""
14,Animal Farm,0452284244,George Orwell,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"Classic, he was way ahead of his time. Of course evil and lies lurk in our everyday lives. You can see the parallels in today's politics, a must read for everyone and keep your eyes open, freedom is not free-nothing is given to you without consequences read between the lines."
14,Animal Farm,0452284244,George Orwell,Barnes and Noble,4.2,penaaa,"Change can sometimes be good, but not in this case. At first glance, George Orwell's book ""Animal Farm"" might seem like a book for children but as I read the story, I began to realize it was based on the Russian Communist Revolution. It's purely political as well as fantasy, considering the characters are animals. George Orwell says ""it is the history of a revolution that went wrong"" and he was absolutely right. Leaders have a tendancy to get too comfortable with their authority and begin to take advantage of it. The novel explains the many things that can go wrong when someone decides it's time for a change.	""Animal Farm"" is the story of a group of animals living in a farm under human authority. Once manipulated into believing Mr. Jones is evil, as well as all the human race, the animals decide to rebel. They come up with seven commandments that they are expected to live by:1. Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy; 2. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend; 3. No animal shall wear clothes; 4. No animal shall sleep in a bed; 5. No animal shall drink alcohol; 6. No animal shall kill any other animal; 7. All animals are equal.The rules were set and they were final. They drive out the farmer and start to feel as if all authority is gone. Just as fast, the pigs decide they are the ones most fit to be in charge. Sure enough, authority begins to be abused and misused. The pigs treated the animals as if they were above and better than them. They started living in the farmers home, sleeping in the beds and there were even rumors of murder! The other animals were forced to work harder while the pigs sat around and did absolutely nothing. Everything was all too familiar but if you decided to speak up or go against the pigs, you were gone.	I could definitely recommend this book to others because it's very interesting and easy to comprehend. It illustrates manipulation at its worst. Before reading this book, I didn't care much for politics but after I realized everything that could go wrong, it motivated me to be aware of any leader's words and actions. It brought me to the realization that just because it sounds good doesn't always mean go with it because it's easy to be manipulated when the words they're speaking sound right. Change isn't always for the better, even if that's what they're telling you."
15,The Diary of a Young Girl,0553296981,"Anne Frank, Eleanor Roosevelt, B.M. Mooyaart-Doubleday",Barnes and Noble,4.4,mothman,"I love this book- at times I forgot that she was as young as she was, or that she wasn't even alive anymore. I felt like I new her, and she became a great friend of mine. It seemed to me that as she got more and more used to writing, it all seemed to come to her more and more naturally. 
There were some discussions- as innocent as they were- that she and Peter had near the end of the book. I found parts of it a bit awkward to read, seeing as she was so young and open about them, but as a kid myself I know it is a common occurrence in conversation. But, nevertheless, it was one of the few real diaries of the Holocaust that I have come across, and is also one of the best Holocaust books I have ever read. I honestly wish they would've survived and been able to marry. 
Every page holds some new meaning, or some new secret worry that Anne has to hide from everyone else.  And she was so truthful to her diary! She admitted her hopes and fears, and even her angers and faults. When she found her roommate had a secret stash of goods he kept from everyone, I could practically feel her outrage! She described that weird old man so well- he was such a creep! He was probably a weird old pervert, and I'm sorry that she had to room with him. 
I can totally get the mother-daughter fighting thing, though I probably didn't get as mad, and I can never hold a grudge. Anne was right to hold out and keep true to herself, even though it seems no one in the world is willing to do that anymore- but if you're already in hiding and being persecuted for your religion. that's the same thing as being persecuted for your beliefs! Letting go would've been like turning away from your religion, and everything that the Jews fighting for freedom stood for. 
In short- I really liked it, and I would recommend this to anyone, for any occasion. It was a wonderful read, and I will never, ever forget it. It's a shame she didn't live to write more, it really is. Five stars- please, please, please- go read it!"

16,"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Millennium, #1)",0307269752,"Stieg Larsson, Reg Keeland",Barnes and Noble,4.1,onyxdragon,"I've seen some complaints that it is too slow.  To that I say, it's because of realism.  Having done some investigative reporting stuff myself, I can say that the pace at which it starts into its mystery is completely believable.  And the methods used as well.  Is it a little slow in the first half?  Yeah, but is that a bad thing?  No.  It's attention to detail and characterization, and a commitment to realism.  And that's nothing to complain about.

I've seen some opinions about the violence, and I didn't think it was overly graphic... nor without a point.  I can't stand graphic violence with little to no point.  But by the time you get to the end of the first book, at least for me anyway, I found myself fully appreciating his tackling this issue of violence against women in Sweden.  And I finally both fully understood and appreciated the statistics regarding crimes against women that were inserted at the beginning of each new Part of the book.  It seemed clear to me that Larrson wanted to let people know what life in Sweden can be like for a woman, and having no frame of reference to such before reading the book I found myself respecting Larrson for making this his main drive and theme of the story.

I don't know... I can't complain.  I think this is some of the best published writing I've read in a long time.  I was never bored or disinterested.  He kept me captivated from start to finish.

My only complaint is that it's a little more vulgar and perverse than I usually care for.  But even at that, he could have been much more perverse with as much promiscuity some of his characters indulged in; yet he often used the old school film method of setting the implication (or starting the process) and moving on to something else.  Something with plot, something with character.  Something we could care about.

I just need to get the second in the series now, so I can pick up where it left off.  OH, which reminds me, somebody said something about the end being a dud and that's said.  It's called leaving loose ends, because it's a series and you want to keep your readers with you.  If you resolve everything and walk away people won't come back--having been fully satisfied.  My only hope is that the third (and final book he completed) has some full resolve or that they finally let his life-long companion finish his fourth one--which he was working on when he died.

It really is a shame he left so early and that his works couldn't have been written and published earlier in life.  It's reported he had 10 books in the series in mind.  I guess we'll just have to make do with what he gave us."

And besides, there is a family tree one can refer to. This book is highly interesting and engaging. I found that after the first couple of character introductory chapters that the mystery to be solved kept me wanting to keep reading! I enjoyed the complexity of the plot and enjoyed that Larsson takes his time and presents a story with depth. If you want a fast moving book filled with action this book isn't for you. But if you want a thoughtful book that deals with moral issues, has two very interestingly different protagonists (Blomkvist and Salander), has a humdinger of a mystery and yes, does have some intense action, then pick up a copy today!!"

An indispensable quality of writing with a voice true to the character teamed with an overwhelming plot full of blood-curdling twists and heart-wrenching turns ensure Catching Fire a special home on my bookshelf. Catching Fire is most definitely the best YA novel to present itself to me in years. The ending does not merely leave you hanging precariously off the edge of your seat, but gives you the sensation of being shoved out of a moving plane. Quite frankly, I loved it."

I finished the book in one sitting and it is just as extraordinary as the first.  It picks up almost right where the first book leaves off with Katniss and Peeta's return home to District 12.  This book focuses less on the Games and more on the unrest that Peeta and Katniss' defiance of the Capitol has created throughout most of the Districts.  It is just as gut wrenching and heart breaking as the first.  The story is chilling and draws the reader into the harsh yet frighteningly realistic dystopian society of Panem.  Collins is a magnificent writer and I can't wait to read the third and final book!

18,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Harry Potter, #3)",043965548X,"J.K. Rowling, Mary GrandPr??, Rufus Beck",Barnes and Noble,4.7,Guest,"This book's title is excellent. It fits the   book but it doesn't make entirely perfect   sense until further in. However, like the   first two, getting absorbed in the story is   simple. After the first Harry Potter book,   which I started out reading because I wanted   to see if it was as good as everyone said, I   couldn't put it down. It was like escaping to   another world. I know that is probably an   overused phrase but it fits in this case. I   could get away from my stressful school life,   homework, siblings, and nice but sometimes   annoying friends, but also identify with the   characters. Harry's story is so wildly and   exotically different, yet so true for almost   everyone who has ever gone to school or had   an annoying family. Not only that but the   story is enthralling. What started out as   pleasure reading to 'get away' became a quest   to find out what would happen next with each   page of all three books. I started the first   book right after the second came out, and   finished the second a week after the third   came out. Now the rumor is that new additions   will be released once a year. The 7-book   series will be completed when I am 17. They   can't come out fast enough for me!!! The only   book I've read that tops these is 'The Last   Silk Dress' by Ann Rinaldi but it is not like   these books at all. I have varied tastes. I   hope you enjoy Harry Potter"

19,"The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)",0618346252,J.R.R. Tolkien,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,I first started reading The Lord of the Rings while in the military. I had a lot of time to pass and I'm so very glad I chose these books to pass it with. I absolutely loved the story and how J.R.R Tolkien constructs a world I could never have dreamed of on my own. His imagination and superb writing have gone on to inspire innumerable artists in today's culture. I must admit when the movies came out I was hesitant to watch them. I'm glad I did though because they did a very fine job of capturing the magic of the story. Of course there were things left out. The already long movies would have been epic tales that would last hours upon hours on film had everything been included. I highly recommend these books to anyone who wants to be taken away to another time and place where magic is alive and simpler things like home are treasured.
19,"The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)",0618346252,J.R.R. Tolkien,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"I thought that the book was great. You would be able to understand it if you are older than 6th grade. In the story Frodo, a hobbit, inherits a very powerful ring. Frodo and 3 other hobbits travel on a journey to Rivendell to find out what to do with the ring. There they decide that they have to destroy the ring once and for all. The fellowship must travel to the depths of Mount Doom and cast the ring into the fire. What I liked best about the book is that the hobbits aren't the fastest or the strongest of the fellowship, but they don't give up on each other. It is overall a great book that you should read."
19,"The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)",0618346252,J.R.R.

In this book, the beginning of a great war in the land of Middle Earth is unfolding. I would not recommend reading this book until you have read the prelude to it called The Hobbit which describes the tale of  Bilbo Baggins. Now in The Lord of the Rings the fellowship of the Ring. It shows the discovering of the ring of power which was forged in secret by the dark lord Sauron and his sending of the nine ring wraiths to the peaceful land of the shire and Frodo Baggins and his fear full escape to the elf city of Rivendell with the ring wraiths on there tails ready to kill any that stood in there way. The final part I can say without ruining the book is in Rivendell under the wise council of the elf lord Elrond a ground of nine ( a elf, dwarf, 4 hobbits, and 2 men)set out on a almost completely hopeless quest to destroy the ring of power forever.                  The reason I enjoyed that book and I think you will too. Is because this book is described in the most brilliant detail and you can see everything unfold in your head, and the everlasting fantasy that you won't forget anytime soon."

They expected more, it didn't live up to the hype, ect. ect. But I thought it was a great end to the trilogy. Katniss was in a state of mental unstability--but honestly, who wouldn't? She has gone through so much in the past two books and this one, that while she is SO strong, everyone has their breaking point and throughout the book Katniss was pushed to hers. She saw loved ones die and see the pain the Capitol put them through. The fact that by the end of the book she was still functioning is an accomplishment in my book.

As for the rest of the book it was filled with emotion and action. It was a bit fast paced and some things seemed to happen so fast and unclear, but besides that it was a truely amazing book. I recommend it to everyone and all Hunger Games fans."
20,"Mockingjay (The Hunger Games, #3)",0439023513,Suzanne Collins,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Nikkayme,"I finished Mockingjay just last night and having just re-read some of my favorite parts, I have to say that I'm feeling completely drained. Both mentally and emotionally. The closing book in the trilogy is a whirlwind of everything that made the previous two books brilliant, but this one holds a much more terrifying and foreboding tone.

Every twist, every surprise will tear you apart in some way. It's really difficult for me to describe it if you haven't read the book, but the characters go through hell and back here.

Where The Hunger Games introduced us to this world where children were forced to fight to the death and Catching Fire lit the spark of a rebellion, Mockingjay becomes a war zone. Happy endings are hard to come by and there is a massacre around every corner, making this book so much darker than the last two.

Instead of going into the war zone of an arena, we are catapulted into a real war zone with bombs, gunfire, and death. The politics of it all leaves us unable to trust anything we learn. Everyone has motives for doing what they are doing, but it's a matter of figuring just what is right that is the most difficult part. All this leads to so much inner turmoil for Katniss and a box of Kleenex may be needed to make it to the end. I know I was tearing up every few chapters.

Many characters face obstacles that we could never imagine and minor characters take on roles we could only have hoped for. The lies, deceit, hatred, anguish, despair, heartache, joy, and even hope take their toll. There were a few times when I just had to take a break and pull myself together because the book was just wiping me out. The death, the carnage, and the emotional upheaval are a lot to take. Collins never lets us forget that we are in a war zone with Katniss and in war, there are no winners. Fighting a war is not easy and there will be casualties and consequences, lives lost and lives destroyed.

The war zone mentality detracts from the Team Peeta/Team Gale atmosphere that lingered in the last two books, but the relationship between Peeta/Katniss/Gale is still explored with insurmountable care and delicacy. With all that has happened, one can only hope that all of them can find some sort of peace.

Suzanne Collins did something special with this series. Not only is the world of THG absolutely captivating, it is thought-provoking and emotional. Mockingjay is a heart-wrenching finale that will leave readers thinking about it long after turning that final page. The rollercoaster ride of emotions left me drained from the intensity of a world where a girl lit the spark that ignited a nation.

As I began to read it more and more, not only did I like it, but I began to be so attached to the story and especially the characters, which the author ,Alice Sebold, writes about in great detail. The story is about a 13 year old girl named Susie Salmon who has a normal, but nice life. Her life is soon put to an end though once she is murdered by one of her neighbors. She than goes off to heaven and looks down on her murderer and on her coping family. Alice Sebold has made an imaginative story which has a wonderfully set up plot that features suspense, romance, some mystery, tragedy, and hope. The Lovely Bones is a book that I think everybody of all ages and gender should read."
22,The Lovely Bones,0316166685,Alice Sebold,Barnes and Noble,4.1,saffie90,"I'm 13 years old but read at a very high reading level. This book, to me, was absolutely amazing. I will never forget it. The plot was amazing, the story line great. The emotion Alice Sebold puts into the book is literal, yet touching. A girl murdered tells the story of her life, then watches her family grow, have problems, and become better people from heaven. She watches the murderer of herself cover up his path. She watches her sister grow up. It's all very heartbreaking, yet very amazing. Truly a must-read."

The story is very absorbing, and I like the addition of many new characters in the book.  Rowling gives us a glimpse further into the world of wizardry with the integration of the other magic schools.  In my opinion, a very interesting read, with many twists and turns not seen in any of the Harry Potter books earlier in the series.  I can read it over and over again and not get tired of it.

Rowling is about a young wizard tryin to complete his training at Hogwarts School, of witchcraft and wizardry. After seeing the movie and reading the book I noticed that J.K. Rowling and the director had different interpretations on some of the ways the story went.          Harry Potter is midway through both his training as a wizard and his coming of age. Harry wants to leave the Dursleys home, to venture to be part of the famous Quidditch World Cup with his friends Ron and Hermione. He attends, but something strange happens at the World Cup. Will Harry overcome this? After his adventure Harry returns to Hogwarts to find out that the famous Tri-Wizard Tournament is held at Hogwarts. During the Tournament Harry a young 4th year student must overcome certain obstacles like learning new spells, dealing with people such as Malfoy, and asking his crush to the dance before anyone else does.

Harry Potter's final saga 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows' had been set upon the world. I dare say that no one will be disappointed. Harry's final adventure is a remarkable journey into the world of fantasy. The wedding of Fleur and Bill as it ends  in chaos. The escape of our trio from the death eaters and that is only the beginning. And the many subsequent adventures. Finally ending with the final battle at Hogwarts and the defeat of Voldamort by Harry. An adventure froth with danger, fears, laughter, doubts and narrow excapes will have its readers on the edge of their seat. I was!"
25,"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Harry Potter, #7)",0545010225,"J.K. Rowling, Mary GrandPr??",Barnes and Noble,4.7,NS50,"The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. This is the tone of J. K. Rowling's last book, a gripping story in which Harry Potter and his friends go through terrible struggles throughout their quest to destroy death, in the form of Voldemort.  He is a cruel evil wizard that would kill anyone in his way to get what he wants. The book leaves every question answered.  This book will be the best fantasy adventure book that you have ever read.  This is the classic tale of good versus evil. The major conflict is the battle for a better world without evil. 
The 3 protagonists include Harry, Ron Weasly, and Hermione Granger.  Ron is Harry's best friend that he met in his first year on the Hogwarts express and has stuck by him through thick and thin. Ron brings comic relief and the intrigue of romance, as he competes for the affection of Hermione.  Hermione is also Harry's friend who also met him on the Hogwarts express and has always stuck up for harry and helps him figure out every problem. Hermione is the real brains of the outfit, and knows what she's doing at all times. As for Harry himself, he is the complete hero:  puzzler, brave, true friend, and honorable person. He's the heart and muscle, who brings hope to everyone around the world. Just as every Batman has his Joker, Harry is confronted on all sides, and sometimes from within. Together they are like the Three Musketeers! Or like Ocean's 11, they are Harry's 3.  
The setting is the unimaginable world of wizardry, where everything is a surprise but following the invisible logic of magic. J.K. Rowling's style is both clever and mysterious. She'll draw you in with charm and leave you wondering what happened pages later.  Rowling likes to leave clues for us to try to figure things out.  Her pages are packed full of big visual descriptions of the atmosphere, the mood, the setting, and all the different creatures. The only thing that let me down about this story was the simple fact that it ended!
If you came looking for complex characters and mysterious plot twists, then this is the book for you. If not, then go grab yourself a copy of People magazine and go crazy! This is Rowling's Book 7, the last of the series that wraps-up all the questions about what you thought you knew about Harry. She has taken our connection to Harry beyond what we have imagined.  My final recommendation to Potter fans and critics is a big ""two thumbs up."" This book is for anyone to read at all ages and it will want to make you keep on reading until the very end.  It looks like the end of the road for Harry, or is it?"

26,"The Da Vinci Code (Robert Langdon, #2)",0307277674,Dan Brown,Barnes and Noble,4.3,sbux06,"There's nothing more I like about a book than its ability to make me want to keep reading and reading. Honestly, there was no good stopping point. I would stop then quickly skim the first line of the next chapter and before I know it, I've read into two more chapters. Very entertaining and enjoyable from beginning to end. Loved it!"
26,"The Da Vinci Code (Robert Langdon, #2)",0307277674,Dan Brown,Barnes and Noble,4.3,kpopluvr18,"To be honest, reading a book in my free time never hit the top of my ""to do"" list.  The DaVinci Code by Dan Brown made me want to read more.  From this one book, I realized that Dan Brown could transport you to the world of the Holy Grail.

The way the book flowed made it seem like the story took place over a few days.  In reality, Dan Brown has written a 489-page book over the course of 24 hours.

Honestly, there weren't many times when I could say, ""I should stop reading if I want to get enough sleep.""  Every page was filled with action-packed scenes, puzzles, and interesting insights.

There were some things I didn't like about the book, however.  Throughout the book, Dan Brown used French words in the dialogue.  He doesn't include a glossary--well, not in the paperback edition, at least--and sometimes I have to skip over the French words or use my imagination to figure out what they mean.  Also, the descriptions of the Louvre, for instance, seem like they come out of a travel brochure.  Honestly, I didn't need to know every single detail of the Louvre because I saw it on the Internet before. 

You should read The DaVinci Code if you have an interest in codes and puzzles, conspiracies, and mystery.  Dan Brown does an excellent job of explaining his ideas, up to the point where a teenager can understand.  This is what I like about Dan Brown.  He is able to captivate his audience with controversial topics while reminding us that his books are fiction.

I highly recommend this book to people of all ages, and I hope that you'll enjoy this book as much as I did."
26,"The Da Vinci Code (Robert Langdon, #2)",0307277674,Dan Brown,Barnes and Noble,4.3,bookdork89,"When I took the decision of sitting down and read the book it was because of the high recommendations that it had received from all my friends and teachers. I myself am not much of a reader, but as soon as I started reading the book I just couldn't let go of it. After reading this book I can certainly say that Dan Brown is a true genius.
The Da Vinci code is a masterpiece. It's one of those books that are unique and that are always going to be a must read. It starts out with a murder case, but it isn't your typical case of finding out who it is, Dan Brown is sure of leaving more than evidence towards the true secret behind this murder case that has more behind it than just a guilty assassin. I assure you that throughout the whole journey that the protagonist Robert Langdon and Sophie Nevue undergo you will feel the tension and the passion for finding out the secret that Da Vinci has left for us. You will feel nervous, you will feel sad and disappointed when you can't find out the secret and you will utter satisfaction, you will end up with an open mouth. It has all the characteristics of a mystery/adventure novel that will make you enjoy this book as if you're Robert of Sophie themselves. I'm certain that you won't be able to think about anything else when you're not reading the book. Besides all this incredible characteristics it also has a small dose of love between the 2 main characters, that throughout the whole book you can see the obvious chemistry that exist between them.
So for all those readers who like the unexpected, this is your book, when you're sure that that's the guy, or that they have solved the mystery, I assure you, you will be wrong, the truth will blow your mind. One of the things that I most enjoyed was the fact that several things were happening at the same time with different characters, the author gives you just the amount of information about what's happening with one character to leave you hooked, and then will go and tell you in the next chapter what's  happening with the other characters and ALSO LEAVE YOU HOOKED! so you won't be able to stop reading you will read faster and faster, holding your breath to the sudden twists the book takes, and be breathless by the end of it. Although Dan Brown's literature as a whole may not be very good, it is apt for many ages and great to be read as a fictional fun book that will leave you with a sweet taste of mouth. When finishing the Da Vinci code you will want to read more of Dan Brown, The Da Vinci Code is an amazing book and I dare rate it without a doubt a 5 star book. What's great about Dan Brown is that he doesn't stop his masterpiece here he continues his extravagant writing in books like Angels and Demons, Digital Fortress, and Deception point, so I can say without a doubt that Dan Brown is one of top authors of this age with a creativity that is worth being turned into a book."

27,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Harry Potter, #6)",0439785960,"J.K. Rowling, Mary GrandPr??",Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, by J.K. Rowling, is another incredible account on the life of Harry Potter. Entering his sixth year at the acclaimed school of witchcraft and wizardry, Hogwarts, Harry is faced with an even tougher set of tasks than ever before. Throughout the year, Dumbeldore calls upon him occasionally for some ""private lessons"", but Harry soon finds out that these lessons are not for practicing his magic. No, Dumbeldore calls upon Harry to once again delve into the Pensieve, and explore the many memories people have of a younger Tom Marvolo Riddle, or Lord Voldemort. The reason Dumbeldore is doing this is because he believes he has found the secret to Voldemort's power: Horcruxes, and the only way they will be able to find the horcruxes is to find objects that Voldemort was very attached to. Horcruxes are a very dangerous and dark type of magic in which one slices up his/her soul and hides it in objects, so even when they die, they aren't really dead until ALL of their soul is destroyed. Dumbeldore believes that he has found one of Voldemort's horcruxes and wants Harry to come and help him destroy it.
I give this book 5out of 5 stars because I believe this is a book in which many teenagers and even adults can relate. Rowling, including the other five books in the series, creates an imaginative world, but that relates to society today, which is why they are all so popular. Rowling assembles her characters so that many different types of children can relate to them. For example, Ron is struggling with his hormones and is continually ""snogging"" with his newfound girlfriend Lavender, but isn't really sure about the whole relationship thing. Now many teenage boys (or girls) can definitely relate to this! Most boys aren't sure what the heck they feel and go with their first instinct: to get a girlfriend no matter what. This relation to the real world, and many others, is part of the reason why I love these books and why so many others do as well.
The last reason (but not the only reasons) I give this book 5 out of 5 stars is because of the intense suspense and just how well the book is written. Just like every other Harry Potter, every single page leaves you begging you for more. Personally, I'd just read these books for hours on end if I could. Rowling ends every chapter in a way that you can't just put it down and stop reading for the day: you HAVE to keep reading. The plot in this Harry Potter is incredibly thought out, super exciting, but surprisingly simple, which I think is why many people read it so often. It is not difficult to understand at all but the imagination Rowling put into writing is (and all the others) is astonishing. 
In conclusion, I give this book 5 out of 5 stars and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for an amazing book to read. This is my favorite series of books EVER and this is my 2nd favorite one in the series, next to Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire."

It's an amazing and consuming story that shows how people can be innately good or evil.It dives into the human psyche and unrivels the tangled knot that is the mind. It also envolpes the religous scope of man, Simon as a Christ character and the pigs head as Beelzebub,great. I do admit dialogue is hard to follow but if you take the time to look past that it's amazing! One of the best books I have ever read!!"

This tale was so engrossing that I finished it that same Saturday.The reason this book was so captivating was Golding's carefully woven tale of wonder and brutality. Not only is Lord of the Flies an allegory, but it is also a tale where we are forced to confront the utterly shocking extremes of human nature.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a challenging and frightening, yet extremely enjoyable read.

Like everyone in my class ended up loving it, although when I first saw it on the syllabus, I groaned and thought ""Great, we have to read Romeo and Juliet."" I liked it especially the quick, sarcastic and witty dialouge, and paraphrasing. You have to be good at that in order to read this, or NONE of it will make sense at ALL. We also watched the 1968 movie version (don't watch the new one-it's awful). My favorite character in the play was Mercutio!!! he was funny."

This is a smart, clever thriller that dissects the marriage of Amy and Nick Dunne. It's a dark, twisted story that will leave you shocked. (At least, I was shocked...and I can't stop talking about how much I loved it.)

I should mention, I didn't like Flynn's first novel, I only picked this one up because I only heard good things from people I trust."

I believe this is a fantastic book that should be relished without any prior knowledge of its plot.  Wonderful prose. Insightful observations. Great character development. There are so many comments I would like to make, but I would ruin the suspense for others. I was/am so emotionally charged at the ending that I want to become a character in the story.  Without spoiling the plot for those who chose to enjoy this incredible book, I suspect that many readers will have a similar reaction and would like to join me as residents of Carthage, Missouri."
30,Gone Girl,0297859382,Gillian Flynn,Barnes and Noble,3.8,MrsRedditAll,"I read...a lot.  Like, I need to read.  After reading &quot;Gone Girl,&quot; I know why. Very seldom will you come across a book that finishes so well. The story keeps you reading...so many stories can do that. This one, however, does what so few can accomplish by ending well. Satisying, is the best word I can think of. I realized I keep looking for a book that will satisfy all my cravings in a good story: suspense, humor, anger, sadness, relief.  A fine book doesn't have to leave you guessing throughout the plot to keep you wanting more.  Flynn keeps it straight to the point with enough twists to make it twisted without becoming too complicated to follow. 
This book will grab you like a hyped-up media headline and won't let you go! We all get caught up in the mainstream, bombshell news casts, and this book takes you right there in the middle of it.  Love the technique and can't wait to see what Gillian Flynn comes up with next!"
31,The Help,0399155341,Kathryn Stockett,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Tarasview,I absolutely LOVED this book. Kathryn Stockett did an amazing job. I loved how the story was written from the perspectives of the different women. I enjoyed seeing the world through their very different eyes and watching them develop throughout the story. The beautifully descriptive writing drew me in and made me feel like I was right there. This is an intense story of how these different women deal with the issue of racism during the civil rights movement. It is a poignant and deeply moving novel. I didn't want the book to end.

32,Of Mice and Men,0142000671,John Steinbeck,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"Set in the 1930s, John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men depicts the nomadic lives of George Milton and Lennie Small. The two men travel together, but are as different as can be. George is a small, intelligent man, while Lennie is an incredibly large man with the intellect of a child. Though the two are complete opposites, they are each other's family. This tale encompasses the thematic ideas of everlasting friendship as well as the unreachable American Dream. Steinbeck is able to integrate these topics brilliantly into a single novel, one that the reader will not put down until it is completed. The timeless themes within this book and the way they are presented are what truly sets it apart from any other clich&#233; Western novel. Not only do George and Lennie, the protagonists of the novel, seek an undying friendship, but the other men working on the ranch, long for that same companionship. They all crave the brotherhood that results in fidelity to one another and an unspoken bond that can never be broken. Steinbeck flawlessly portrays his characters as they search for this ideal friendship. The author also successfully illustrates the unfeasibility of the American Dream. The reader is made aware throughout the book that almost every character has once envisioned themselves living an alternate life; one filled with absolute contentment and complete serenity. The fact that not a single character has attained their dream shows that the idealized American Dream is impossible to truly achieve. John Steinbeck does a phenomenal job in displaying the ambition and certainty that the characters possessed towards reaching their variation of the Dream, as well as the hopelessness and gloom they experience upon realizing the impossibility of it. The desires that John Steinbeck so eloquently incorporates into Of Mice and Men are timeless and easily relatable. Any reader can feel instantly connected to the characters and their struggles. This remarkable novel leaves the reader utterly captivated and with a sense that hopes and dreams may not be all that you can count on to get you through in life."

Generally I do not like stories that take place back in the day. However, I LOVED this novel. Maybe it was because it is so well known around the world. John Steinbeck created such amazing characters, and the events that occurred always kept me at the edge of my seat. I hated when the bell rang because I knew I would have to wait until the next day in class to see what would happen. Everyone should read this at some point. The movie was just as great, also!"
33,Memoirs of a Geisha,0739326228,Arthur Golden,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,This book was amazing and a beautiful read. It felt like Chiyo and Sayuri were right next to me telling the story of their lives. Beautifullly witten. This book engulfs the reader in its own world and even the most relunctant readers will find that they can't put this book down. I told my friend who only read a book once in a while and she finished the book in about 4 days. The story pulls your heart strings and you will hold your breath to find out what happens next. It is one of those books that when you hear its name again you immediately smile and say what a good book it was. You'll find yourself reccommending it to all your friends and family.
33,Memoirs of a Geisha,0739326228,Arthur Golden,Barnes and Noble,4.6,StacieRosePittard,"I first want to address a couple reviews I read before I purchased Memoirs of a Geisha, because I very nearly skipped this novel due to the content of these reviews. People were offended by the sexual content in this novel, and some even said that the author gave the impression that Geisha were more sexual than they really are.

I disagree. Yes, there is a bit of sexual content, but it is in no way overwhelming, nor does it mislead readers to believe that Geisha are the same as prostitutes. If anything, the author of this book does a fantastic job of describing the art of the Geisha. I learned quite a bit about Geisha, and what they really do. I've always heard some people insist that a Geisha's job had nothing to do with sex, while others say that Geisha were no different from prostitutes. Both are wrong, and this book does a fantastic job of clarifying that balance. On top of that, it paints a wonderful picture of both the darker and brighter sides of a Geisha's life. It's not pure oppression, while at the same time it's not all rainbows and butterflies. I love that the author was honest in this portrayal, and kept his writing very respectful and open about a Geisha's life style.

And finally, it was simply an interesting story. The characters were well developed and interesting to follow, and I found myself deeply connected to their experiences. It's a wonderful novel I highly recommend."
33,Memoirs of a Geisha,0739326228,Arthur Golden,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,I adore the film adaptation but it's like looking at the reflection of a flower compared to the tragic loveliness the novel portrays. While there are some cultural innacuracies that a concientious reader would do well to research (the very misunderstood mizuage ceremony specifically) it tells a simple and sad but ultimately peaceful story. If you liked the film you will love this even more!

And yes it was a fast and easy read. So for entertainment factor I give it 2 stars. HOWEVER, do not be fooled...I would NOT consider this well written, nor is this close to the best book I've ever read. One of the other reviewers mentioned phrases repeated over and over again, and I couldn't agree more. At multiple points, it was as if the story was moving in circles. Sex scene after sex scene...which as you can imagine will keep you reading! So, if you are looking for a mindless romance novel full of descriptive sex scenes.... this is your book.

Before choosing to dive into these books myself, I read hundreds of reviews. These reviews left me unsure about spending the $30 to read the trilogy. I can't express how glad I am that I did. There are a few important points I want to make: So many of the bad reviews consist of comments regarding the repetitive use of words or phrases such as ""inner goddess"" or ""beguile."" Come on now, who cares? Other reviews bluntly call this ""PORN."" I could not disagree more. Does EL James use the same word twice in a sentence? Does she use the phrase ""inner goddess"" multiple times throughout the works? Did I have to use my dictionary and/or thesaurus countless times while reading the series? The answer to all of those questions is YES. However, when reading, are these the sorts of things readers should really be focused on? My answer to that question is NO. So what if I had to use my thesaurus? So what if Ana and Christian talk differently than most of my American friends in some conversations? This was a beautiful piece of fiction. Rather than nagging about the fact that I had to look up several words, I saw it as an opportunity to expand my vocabulary, which I absolutely did. Now onto the fact that some people consider these books ""PORN."" That's absurd. Are there countless sexual encounters, most of them very graphic? Yes. Firstly, when you go to read these books, you are likely well aware of these facts. So, don't complain about it AFTER you read them. Secondly, I do not practice, nor do I know much about the BDSM sexual lifestyle. However, I feel that the BDSM lifestyle is essential to the story of Christian Grey. So are the numerous sexual encounters. The sex and the BDSM aspect play an important role in the story. Without it, the GROWTH of the characters would not be as evident. Christian is a troubled man with a disturbing past, which has led him to choose this type of lifestyle. However, Ana saves him. And, that is what makes this such a beautiful love story... Not to mention, the beginning of most new, steamy relationships does consist of a lot of sex. It's reality for most people. Here's another thing most reviews don't mention: These books are LAUGH OUT LOUD funny! The email exchanges between Ana and Christian had me giggling nonstop. In addition to giving me the giggles, the characteris in this story also warmed my heart, scared me to death, made me furious, and even made me cry. This trilogy has it all! My advice: ignore the bad reviews; ignore the repetition of some words and phrases throughout the book; look past all the sex. See what this story TRULY is: a BEAUTIFUL love story that is the perfect example of how love can change even the darkest of souls. I will certainly be reading the future works of EL James. The Fifty Shades Trilogy is by far my favorite series to date. If I could give 10 stars, I certainly would. READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
35,The Alchemist,0061122416,"Paulo Coelho, Alan R. Clarke",Barnes and Noble,4.2,pucketth,"Although I feel that previous reviews will make mine look incompetent and childish, i still feel like putting my two cents in.  This novel portrays Coelho's view on the meaning of life, that everyone has a preset dream and destination, but it is their choice to take the journey or not. Paul tells his story by using a shepherd boy that decides to follow his path to get to his destiny. the shepherd, Santiago, meets several people that open his eyes and show him why he has decided to do this.
What I liked about this book was the great imagery Coelho uses throughout the novel. Also, I love that this book is different than any others I have read. It takes you on a journey, not an adventure to slowly get the author's point across. You will feel yourself getting smarter and more adventurous as you read this book.
What i disliked about this book was that it is slow at points and gets a little monotonous, but if you keep pushing, it will all be well it. 
I am only 14 and I have read this book 2 times. It makes you want to make sure you don't hold back in your life, that you achieve something amazing. Forget about the normal way of life. I would recommend this book to anyone who is willing to read a book that will question the way you are living and will make you want to drop everything and go find your alchemist."

After losing my copy during a move, i decided I had to replace it.  After reading it again, I remember why it's such an incredible story.  it makes you question yourself, your career, society and think of things in a different perspective.  the writing is superb and you get sucked in from the very beginning.  it's a page turner, even after having read it many times before.  as i mentioned in the title, it's one of my favorite books of all time.  i highly recommend it to anyone who likes to read something that makes them think.  A must read for everyone!"
36,"The Giver (The Giver, #1)",0385732554,Lois Lowry,Barnes and Noble,4.3,John_117,"The Giver is a fantastic novel well deserving of the Newberry Award. It is the story of a post apocalyptic world that on the surface is perfect. Everyone has a job and a meaningful purpose, there is no crime, no poverty, no hunger. All of the problems of our current world are no more. But things aren't as perfect they seem. In this world you are given your job assigned to you by the Elders during the ceremony of twelves. It is during this ceremony that Jonas is given the job of the Receiver, the most honored job in the community. Being given memories of a much different world by the Giver, Jonas begins to question the perfection of the community and it is here that the story begins to unfold. Angered and confused by his imperfect and very intriguing past, Jonas must save himself and his community from the fantasy life that has been thrust upon them.

I love this book for the simple fact that it poses questions that we never think about. What freedoms would give up if to have a perfect society? How important is individualism? What is the most valuable gift in life?  Once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down. I kept reading to find out what Jonas was going to do but I won't spoil the ending for you. You'll just have to read to find out.

If you're into wizards or galactic star fights this isn't the book for you. But if you enjoy a thought provoking book full of profound questions then this is the novel for you."
36,"The Giver (The Giver, #1)",0385732554,Lois Lowry,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"The Giver was an interesting novel that gave off many emotions. Joy, anger, horror, anguish, love, and desire were just a few of the many emotions the reader will dig up during their read. I did not understand the book at first. However, in the end, everything came together like a puzzle, and I could comprehend it.I do not recommend this book for anyone below thirteen. It has very disturbing points that the main character, Jonas, must go through. He must test his courage, strength, and heart in this story. These events cause unbelievable tension and terror, but, to a teenager or adult, this book would be a very good read. I believe The Giver shows us what we could do to ourselves in the future. We want to fit in so badly, that ¿Sameness¿ could become a real thing. It teaches us that our individuality is dangerous, but, at the same time, it allows us who we are. In the end, I did enjoy the novel and recommend it to my fellow readers. It was well written and was written to provide shocking moments for the reader."

Although the first chapter is a little boring, once you read the second chapter you won't be able to put it down. This book was written by an author (C.S. Lewis) from England, so there will be a few unfamiliar words if your not from that area. This book is #2 of the series, but if you go by the order that they were written this book would be the first. There is a total of seven books in the series. These books are The Magician's Nephew, The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, The Horse and His Boy, Prince Caspian, The Voyage of The Dawn Treader, The Silver Chair, and The Last Battle.

38,The Time Traveler's Wife,0965818675,Audrey Niffenegger,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"The Time Traveler's Wife is a heart-wrenching account of a time traveler named Henry, who spontaneously ""travels."" He cannot control when the time travel happens and it leads to a very unpredictable life. Henry meets Clare and thus begins a love story of two people who can never be completely together. The Time Traveler's Wife will stay with you well after you've read the ending. I read the ending over and over again wanting to relive the last moment these two lovers were together. Melancholy follows the two lovers and propels you to keep reading. There is deep symolism in the novel, though the circumstances around the two main characters is outlandish, the feelings behind it are real. How can you truly be 100% with someone who can never be there for you? It's a question a lot of relationships face and Niffenegger answers it beautifully. The movie is coming out this November and is starring Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana. I hope that the movie lives up to the book, though it will be hard. Interesting read, I recommend it with 5 stars."

38,The Time Traveler's Wife,0965818675,Audrey Niffenegger,Barnes and Noble,4.3,timetraveler-1692-,"Magical and tragic. Painful and frustrating. You have to really open yourself up to fiction to really enjoy the whole concept of a character who has a genetic disorder that allows time travel. There were a few times that I felt the plot was dragged out too far, yet there are characters that could have been given more depth (Kimmie, the marriage of Gomez and Charisse). Overall, I really enjoyed this story, however, it left me feeling bereft with sadness and frustration. We learned the fate of Henry, I don't understand why the author could not leave us with what happened to Clare. We know she lived at least until the age of 82, but what happened inbetween? Did she remarry? Did the several pairs of golashes allude to grandchildren, a husband??? What happened to Gomez and Charisse (Charisse feared that Gomez would leave her for Clare when Henry was gone)? Did Clare live the rest of her life in the present like Henry asked her to? After investing so much time into this book, the ending was unfair to the reader. Good writing, new concept and idea as far as time travel goes."
39,"A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, #1)",0553588486,George R.R. Martin,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Sutinike,"Martin has created a masterpiece with this series.

Never have I read any novel of any genre with so many characters, all so brilliantly lifelike, believable and richly detailed. He doesn't introduce them too quickly, giving the reader time to get to know and love them, and as soon as a side is chosen, he takes us into the world of the opposing characters, and we come to love them equally!

The scope of the series is truly epic, and while this is technically fantasy, the reader may forget that it's not historical fiction! The style is so gritty and unforgiving that one has no choice but to believe. The fantastical elements creep in slowly and undeniably - a skeleton in a closet, terrifying and mostly unseen.

With character drama like this, you don't have to be a fantasy buff to love this series. All who like sweeping drama will enjoy this fantastic journey."
39,"A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, #1)",0553588486,George R.R. Martin,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Elantraboi,"While I am fan of sci-fi and fantasy, I had never read anything by George R.R. Martin.  I was scolded for this oversight by many of co-workers and friends.  I finally gave in this past month and have been converted to a fan.

Be warned, ""A Game of Thrones"" is not for the casual fantasy reader.  It is deeply intricate and rich.  While Martin focuses each of the chapters on roughly ten main characters, there are well over fifty full realized characters in just the first book of this series.  It would be very easy to get confused or frustrated in the early pages of the tome, but to do so would be to lose out on the epic second half of the book.  Up until the last one hundred pages, I was still on the fence about this ""game of thrones.""  Now, having finsihed it, I can't wait to move on to the next book.

As a standalone book, I would not reccomend it; as the beginning of an epic series, I am totally hooked."
39,"A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire, #1)",0553588486,George R.R. Martin,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"This is as good as the Fantasy genre can get.  I've read dozens of fantasy books by dozens of authors and this is simply the very best series I've ever read.  It stands head and shoulders above Lord of the Rings or really anything else I can imagine.  ---  The characters come completely to life.  The author conveys a sense of reality to each person in his story.  There aren't just 'good' guys and 'bad' guys as there are in the plethora of other highly rated fantasy series 'LotR, Dragonlance, Savadore books et. al.'.  Instead, each character has their strengths and their weaknesses.  Their noble redeeming qualities and their inner demons and selfishness.  In essence...they're human!  It sounds simple, but surprisingly not very many authors can accomplish this feat as well as Mr. Martin has been able to.  He does a brilliant job of making each of the characters unique and detailed in their personality and mannerisms.---    The story line is brilliant and kept me interested throughout the series.  This is possibly the fastest I've read through a book.---    Another thing...this book is not for children.  There's no Bimbldee-goo Gobleshanks or Dimpledink Fumplesnaps B.S. kiddie stuff like Tolkien.  There is no 'good guy' to root for, only different people of different kingdoms.  And sometimes the person you might peg as a 'good guy' may not 'win.'  The subject matter at times can be quite mature and maintains a high level of maturity throughout.---    So, although there are countless other rave reviews for this book, I figured I'd contribute anyhow.  Believe the hype, and don't believe the naysayers.  If you enjoy medieval fantasy 'not high fantasy, there aren't goblins and elves in this book' with an in depth and very realistic storyline get this book now.---"
40,"Eat, Pray, Love",0143038419,Elizabeth Gilbert,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Anonymous,"This was the most irritating book I have come across in quite some time. I honestly fail to understand what all the fuss is about.  The character is rich, self-absorbed, and narcissistic.  Yeah she was suffering, my heart bleeds for someone who has the money to traipse all over the world to find herself finally lighting in paradise where she meets a rich handsome man. Give me a break, and take a reality check.  It says much for our culture that the movie should be such a success, and that the book is a best seller. Honestly, the writing is not that great and the character .well what can I say?  More New Age dribble and easy answers except that in this case she has the financial wherewithal to travel the world to find herself.  Give us all a break."
40,"Eat, Pray, Love",0143038419,Elizabeth Gilbert,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,"A friend recomended this book to me after I had gone through divorce and then been diagnosed with cancer thinking I would find some wisdom within these pages.    However, what I found was an incredibly narcissistic writer/character. I kept waiting for her to suddenly stop in the middle of it all and just declare how self absorbed she is and then begin a real and truly honest self examination that would impart some valuable wisdom. Instead, she uses cliche riddled writing to avoid all of the hard subjects and not really be honest with the reader.    I can very much relate to her feelings of anxiety and stress as the result of her divorce, but she spends only a few pages on this and avoids providing the reader with any kind of an honest and real examination as to why her relationship failed, what she learned from it or what love means to her. After reading more about her as a writer she seems like a very talented and intellectually curious person, but none of that comes through in this book. All that the reader sees is someone who is very lucky, but doesn't really seem to appreciate it.    When she writes that she was not saved by her prince -- surprise, surprise she meets a good looking, intelligent man at the end -- but that she saved herself, I had to ask, 'From what?' It certainly wasn't extraordinary narcisism.    In the end, all I learned is that the author is a really lucky person."

A few of them recommended this book to me.  And I'm glad they did...this is a troubling book.

The most troubling thing about this vapid text isn't the fact that Gilbert is an annoying person; no, most troubling is the fact that so many people here are identifying with the narrator's ""search.""  Really?  You identify with an upitty, wealthy, New England divorcee who got paid to travel and ""find"" herself?  From the faux-philosophical ruminations on ""God,"" to the juvenile talk of Italian men (""I like kissing""--no joke--she really got paid to write that), Gilbert attempts to convince you that she's intellectual, spiritual, and--somehow--had a tough life.

Gilbert tells us in the first chapter that she's not going to go into why her marriage broke apart (though she admits that much of it was her fault), but then details numerous faults with her husband (his biggest fault?  He wanted her to have--gasp!--children!).  The disingenuousness of Gilbert knows no limits!  She tells us early on that she ""got rid of all her possessions.""  How noble, right?  Well, not really, she just put them into storage.  How serendipitous! 

At all times, Gilbert's vapid self-centered ""wanderer"" takes center stage. Gilbert takes an entire sentence(!) to walk through a Roman neighborhood used as a Jewish Ghetto in WWII, and promptly discards that invitation to measure her own struggles against true adversity in favor of saying how she likes to visit the Pantheon.

If you'd like to read a sincere look at personal struggle, please read Jhumpa Lahiri's ""Unaccustomed Earth"" or Louise Errich's ""Plague of Doves."""

Also, I enjoy helping my friends who are teachers find new material to help keep students interesting in reading.  I did not know what to expect, although I knew the book was brought to life on film.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  The inventive aspect of bringing greek mythology to modern day living is ingenious.  Having taken a year of mythology in school, it was wonderful to see a new way of getting young people interested a type of history that does not seem to be explored much.  Not only will these books excite young readers to keep with the books, but also the books might just interest the reader enough to look into ancient history.  My only drawback is there are ancient stories mentioned in the books and sometimes not explained.  (Meaning outside reading will need to occur).  Although these stories are not central in any way to the books, it is nice to know the history.  I had to refresh my memory on a few points. Great to read with your children if you read chapter books.    Overall, great reading for old and young alike."

  In my opinion, the book Little Women is a classic book for many ages. I thought the book was interesting and I personally have read the book at least twice. The book has a timeless theme. It also has characters that relates to most.
  In conclusion, I would suggest you read it at least once. The March family reminds you that even in rough times you can get through it. Louisa May Alcott has created in my opinion a timeless book. This book will probably remain popular for many years.

I was once told by a friend that it was horrible and that I should never, ever read it. I did, anyway, and I was thoroughly surprised and I enjoyed every bit of it!
Knowing very little about the plot (I'd only been told there's a crazy person in an attic --- which I forgot about), or even Bronte's writing style, I read the first ten chapters with shock and awe that the story was about a ten-year-old. Although the entire book is not about a ten-year-old, I was quickly taken with the plot and characters and just descriptions of England at that time. 
This book read quickly with alternately likeable and despicable characters, unusual language, and beautiful plot. 
My only complaint is that one character, Adele, speaks chiefly in French. I was lucky enough to be taking French classes while reading this, so I could piece together what she was essentially saying. What she says is not of a whole lot of importance, but it does bring the book to a halt at times.
All in all, Jane Eyre exceeded my expectations by leaps and bounds and I enjoyed reading it immensely."

I bought this edition because I thought the cover was pretty and the fantastic price. Bronte's original text is flawless (although Hindustani is spelled differently in my other copy)I give Bronte 5 stars, however, the introduction by Joyce Carol Oates is terrible. I found it choppy and not that relevant to the story. I don't believe for two seconds that Bertha Mason's insanity was caused by syphilis. I just don't. I also don't buy that Jane thinks human love is more important than God. If she did why did she spend so much time on her knees in prayer? Not one summary, review or movie version I have seen of this story acknowledges any sort of higher power in a non nutcase way. What a shame, I think Bronte should get more credit and less speculation. Let's just take it in the context she wished. I feel better after venting my opinions, bottom line if you want a good copy of Jane Eyre this will work, just ignore the introduction."
44,"The Notebook (The Notebook, #1)",0553816713,Nicholas Sparks,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"As usual, Sparks doesn't disappoint with &quot;The Notebook&quot; as he weaves the tale of two teenagers, Noah and Allie, who meet one fateful summer and fall in love. Since the course of true love is never smooth, it should come as no surprise that Allie's parents do not approve of her relationship with Noah. He does not have the education, money, or social prominence they wish for their daughter. Allie and her parents move away and Noah writes to her for years, but after never receiving an answer gives up. WWII comes, lives change, but one thing remains constant---neither Allie nor Noah can forget the other. As Noah's friend Gus tells him, first love changes your life forever and no matter what else happens in your life, the memory of it stays with you. And so it is that fourteen years later and three weeks before her wedding, Allie finds herself driving to New Bern to find Noah for reasons she herself does not fully understand. Their reunion proves once again that they are true soul-mates, but it that enough? Can Allie forsake the &quot;perfect mate&quot; who has not only her love but also the approval of her parents? Can she walk out on Noah for a second time? Will Noah let her go? The story then skips to the nursing home where an 80-year old Noah resides and spends his time reading poetry to his fellow residents. But down the hall is a very special woman. The reader will be overcome with emotion as this relationship unfolds and the missing pieces of Noah and Allie's story are revealed in the notebook he carries with him. Intensely romantic and a tribute to the power of true love. A True tear jerker."

46,Water for Elephants,1565125606,Sara Gruen,Barnes and Noble,4.3,theReader278,I loved reading this wonderful book! It is a story you don't forget.
46,Water for Elephants,1565125606,Sara Gruen,Barnes and Noble,4.3,LCH47,"The story moves cleverly between the world of 90, or possibly, 93 year old, Jacob, in a nursing home, as he tells the story of his life, the Depression era and the circus world. He was twenty-three and almost ready to take his final exam, when he receives word that both of his parents were in a car accident and did not survive. There was no money as he sat to take his final exam to become a veterinarian. Feeling desperate Jacob jumps on a moving train instead. Having no idea he has jumped on a circus train, he decides he has nothing left and starts working with the circus. He meets a beautiful woman, Marlena, but finds out quickly she is married to a mad-man. However, she returns the attraction and a great love story begins. Water for Elephants is a compelling story that tells us all about growing old, corrupt management, animal cruelty, wonderful animals, kindness and loyalty between people and between people and animals in a world where indifference and cruelty are common. The author's obvious extensive research of history and circus life added so much interest to the background of a wonderful meaningful, love story. This is such a wonderful read and well worth your time!"
46,Water for Elephants,1565125606,Sara Gruen,Barnes and Noble,4.3,vivico1,"Very good story that is well written. Great transitions from the old Jacob to his younger self. Who knew a story about circus trains could be such a great book. Due to some graphic language or truth of treatment to some animals, I would recommend this book, but with that caution to anyone who may be too young and possibly some adults who are very sensitive to that kind of thing. It is hard to read at times about the cruelty, but it is real."
47,The Book Thief,0375831002,Markus Zusak,Barnes and Noble,4.5,AvidBookworm,"This is probably one of the most unique books I've read in like¿forever!  The story is narrated by Death and centers around the events of Nazi Germany in the 1940's.  I rarely give a book five stars.  In that same token, I try to steer away from recommending books that have a morose tone, but this is a true exception. As much as you hope for, long for, and pray for a happy event to occur, you need to keep reminding yourself that the story is being told by Death, so chances of that happening are slim-to-none. The main character of the story, Liesel Meminger, captured my heart.  I loved the way the author, Markus Zusak, developed Liesel's character throughout the story and by a slight-of-hand, he added a side kick to the story, Rudy, who out of no where comes be one of the favored characters of the story. Great technique Zusak!The premise of the story is unique and captivating.  The narrator, Death, is much like Liesel where he/she has a way with words.  Both of them recognize words for what they really are¿they can be used to stimulate good or evil.  Through the power of words, we see how Hitler was able to control a country and persecute people.Great book, awesome character development, insightful recount of Nazi Germany, and a life-long lesson¿what else can you ask for in a book?"
47,The Book Thief,0375831002,Markus Zusak,Barnes and Noble,4.5,angeleyesAS,"I was hooked right away by the unique narrator, Death, who provides a running commentary.  Every character in this story was endearing and I fell in love with them, Liesel, Rudy, Hans, Max and Rosa.  The story of Leisel, a small, young German girl who watches her brother die and her mother disappears, then lives with a foster family that barely manages to survive. In the process of scrounging for a living, Liesel begins stealing books in Nazi territory. She and her friend, Rudy discover the power and excitement that words and language provide. A book begins the story. Daily chores of survival, Liesel experiences her fragile childhood under oppressive and endless horrors of war. There is so much hopelessness, suffering and despair. She bonds quickly with her foster father and slowly with her strict foster mother.  He helps her to trust and teaches her to read a souvenir she steals at her brother's funeral. This story is an inspiring display of how something as small as a book and reading can be the last life line in a young girls life. This beautifully written, complex book is a haunting revelation and once read will not be soon forgotten!"

51,"City of Bones (The Mortal Instruments, #1)",1416914285,Cassandra Clare,Barnes and Noble,4.5,love-2-dance,"if your trying to decide to read this series or not...dont wait! trust me. the first few pages, i cant lie, i was feeling like i was playing catch up. it starts off in the middle of a night out on the town without really explaining much. but after only a few pages i got my bearings and learned who the characters were and how they were related to the main character. WARNING!!!...after you understand whats going on, you wont be able to stop. all types of events start to happen in Clary's life which will hav no choice but to lure you in with her! its not crazy-busy but also leaves no room for you to get bored...the perfect mix. :) everytime there wasnt action or almost unbearable suspense, i was soaked up in the lust and romance of Jace and Clary. although it is written in 3rd person, it is so easy to become the characters and be overwhelmed with their intense emotion. its sad for me to admitt, and i probably would hav beat myself up for even thinking this before i read this series, but the Mortal Instruments Series goes hand in hand with the Twilight saga...or probably even better. this is definitely for people who fell in love with Twilight and just cant seem to find a good enough book to fill its spot. And although the end of this book can be heartbreaking...dont give up on it!! it gets better and better with each sequel!!!!"

It's an edgy urban fantasy with a roller-coaster plot, intricate and original world-building, and complex characters.  Clare's combination of sarcastic humor and deep honesty makes for pitch-perfect dialogue and compelling character development.  A must-read for teen fantasy buffs, this book should also be of interest to adult fans of urban fantasy.  No surprise that the first two books in this series have already hit the New York Times Bestseller List-- This is some of the best stuff to hit the teen market in the last few years."
52,"Eclipse (Twilight, #3)",0316160202,Stephenie Meyer,Barnes and Noble,4.6,vickytren,I just love all of Stephenie Meyer's books. As a fan I would recommend them. can't wait to read the next!!!!!
52,"Eclipse (Twilight, #3)",0316160202,Stephenie Meyer,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Stacie08,"I resisted reading this series for so long.  I couldn't imagine a ""teenage vampire"" book would hold much interest for me.  Boy was I wrong!  I read the series straight through in 2 weeks and loved it!  The courtship between Edward and Bella is pure,tender and romantic.  Edward is chivlarous, intelligent and protective and Bella is sweet, stubborn and selfless.  Jacob and the rest of the supporting characters add variety and some humor to the already fascinating story line. The love story created by Stephanie Meyer reminded me of some of the classics I have read over and over. 
I have never felt so attached to characters in an novel.  I even found myself dreaming of them (it is ok to laugh at me I did too). For the first time ever I even went to the author's website and read everything about her and the story development.  I am sad that she is not writing the series from Edward's perspective like she intended, but I do understand why she made that decision. I highly recommend this series even if you think a vampire/werewolf book sounds corny."

53,"Eragon (The Inheritance Cycle, #1)",0375826696,Christopher Paolini,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Eliz_L,"Eragon is a blazing start to the wildly popular Inheritance saga. Paolini weaves a suspenseful, exiting tale that will keep you turning the pages! The book starts out a tad boring, and it might take a bit of effort to get beyond the first 10 pages, but after that, one event after another sends you to Agla&#235;sia, experiencing Eragon¿s feelings like your own. As Eragon journeys from his home to avenge the death of a loved one, you learn more and more about the infamous Empire and Galbatorix, as well as his black dragon Shruikan. While Eragon studies magic and swordplay, he also learns some secrets better left unknown...I couldn't put it down until I had reached the last page, and even then I hungered for the next book in the series. If you're in the mood for a fantasy book that¿s chock full of fighting, swordplay and good vs. evil, you¿ve come to the right place! I must warn you though, you're not going to like it when you've read all three and Paolini hasn't finished the fourth book!"
53,"Eragon (The Inheritance Cycle, #1)",0375826696,Christopher Paolini,Barnes and Noble,4.5,BookWorm0327p,"This series is fabulous!I honestly think you can't call yourself a fantasy lover until you've read this. When I first picked this up I was so excited that the third book (and what I thought was the last book) would be out in time, so I didn't have to wait for it, but then Paolini pulled a fast one and no I (and many others) have to wait in suspense for the 4th book to come out! I'm not to upset about it though because i know the last book will top them all and it keeps Eragon and his dragon Saphira's story going a little longer! If you're looking for a book filled with adventure, fantasy, and even some romance this is the 1st book i'd recommend!"
53,"Eragon (The Inheritance Cycle, #1)",0375826696,Christopher Paolini,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Cressy,"Eragon was a very organized book, with engaging characters, and a well polished plot. It is a good representation of a boy, not yet 15, becoming one of the almighty, but now nearly extinct dragon riders with lessons in life we should all consider.
     Eragon is about a young farm boy (named Eragon), who finds a polished blue stone while hunting for food in the Spine. The stone hatches, and from it emerges a dragon. Saphira, as she is later named, is the first dragon born after the famed dragon riders were destroyed by Galbatorix, who is now king, and his forsworn. He raises his dragon in secret, afraid the king may find him, but unable to disown the child dragon. Soon, Galbatorix's evil minions, the Ra'zac, pass through the town and learn of the dragon. While Saphira flees into the Spine with Eragon, his home is destroyed and his uncle mortally wounded. Eragon sets out to avenge the Ra'zac with the old storyteller, Brom, who may be more then who he says he is, leading full speed into this thrilling novel.
      I highly enjoyed Eragon, and cannot evaluate the book without high praise for the writing style, characters, and depth. Palini's writing is organized, and descriptive, enabling you to take part in the character's emotion, mind, and setting without overflowing you with information. His characters are full in depth, mind, emotion, and history, enabling you to feel as if they could be anyone in your classroom, or anyone walking through the street. Though you must not forget the plot itself, as it is upbeat, remarkable, and logical. 
     Overall, I absolutely recommend this book to a friend, relative, or bookworm. I complement the style, plot, depth, and honesty of a book marking the journey of a young boy to a fierce warrior. Eragon is a read well worth the time, effort, and price."

I have a vague memory of attempting to read it about 10 years ago - but that was when books only interested me if they had a half-dressed hunk on the cover and promised a few hours of romantic dreams. 

Clearly, this book didn't do that - so on the shelf it went. Now, in reading through the 1001 books to read I saw the name again and thought, hm.. perhaps I should give it a try. I'm glad I did. 

While much of the book feels like it's still over my head (and it took me longer to read then I thought it would, seeing as I had to keep going back over things I didn't understand), I got more than my fair share of giggles out of it. 

I don't think there's really anyone out there who doesn't know what this book is about - so let me tell you what my impressions of it were before, and after reading it. 

Before I started reading this book I thought I knew the story. I understood 42 was somewhere in the book, and my impressions of the story came from an old PC game I picked up several years ago (I gave up on that game very quickly too). I knew there was a ship computer that talked, and that there was a depressed robot. And mostly I knew it was the story of a man named Arthur Dent. What I didn't know was how it all fit together. 

Now I've read the book. I've laughed at the ship computer, finally understand that XKCD comic about the Kindle, loved loved loved Marvin the depressed robot and felt much of the same confusion that Arthur Dent must have felt. And I still don't quite know how it all fits together. 

And that's why I like the book so much. Because I'm going to have to read it, and read it again - and although I think I still probably won't get it, I think I'll enjoy reading it every time, just like I enjoyed reading it this time. And really, if you can't enjoy reading a book... what's the point?"

54,"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, #1)",0345391802,Douglas Adams,Barnes and Noble,4.4,A-Adducchio,"If total randomness is not your thing, steer clear of this book.  Douglas Adams' ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" starts with the Earth being destroyed to make way for a hyper spatial expressway.  The main character, Arthur Dent, and his friend, Ford Prefect, escape annihilation by hitchhiking their way on board one of the Vogon ships that were in the process demolishing the Earth.  After being found and thrown into space, they are rescued by the Heart of Gold, a state-of-the-art ship stolen by the president of the galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox.  When Arthur and Ford meet their hitchhiking hosts, they discover it to be Zaphod and Trillian.  Arthur had previously met Trillian at a party on Earth, just before Zaphod swooped in and took her off into space.  The four travelers find their way to Magrathea, a legendary planet known for manufacturing custom planets.  When they get to Magrathea, Zaphod, Trillian, and Ford are captured and detained by Magratheans.  Arthur is greeted by an old man, Slartibartfast.  He educates Arthur on the history of Magrathea and the computer designed to answer the question to life.  This computer was known as Deep-Thought and produced the answer of forty-two.  The question, to which this answer belongs, is not known by Deep-Thought.  Luckily, Deep-Thought provides the plans for a super computer that will produce this question.  The Earth is the key, but if you want to know more, you will just have to read the book.  While I found this book to be confusing at times, it was also extremely entertaining.  Until you finish the book, it comes across as being completely random. But after finishing the book, everything sort of comes together.  The randomness is what makes this book what it is; without it, it would just be a boring story about four people.  I definitely recommend reading this book, but if possible, read the book before watching the movie.  While entertaining, the movie is not nearly as good as the book.  It is a more enjoyable read if done before watching the movie."

It is a very humbling book. I don't think that kids under 13 should read it though. It has lots of cursing and is extremly descriptive in parts it shouldn't be. It was an awsome book though. Please read it you will love it!!!P.S. The books i recomended are even better!!!

Her voice was as fluid and sweet as honey and her story-telling just brought you right into the story.  One could almost be convinced Lily Owens was an actual person and Jenna's voice was really Lily's as she told you the story of her summer.  I loved listening to the audiobook and when recommending this book to anyone, I always tell them you cannot fully appreciate the beauty of this story without hearing Jenna's narration of it on audiobook.  I've listened to it twice already."
57,The Secret Life of Bees,0142001740,Sue Monk Kidd,Barnes and Noble,4.4,k-dub,"I really enjoyed The Secret Life of Bees. When I was first told that I had to read it I was kind of disappointed. I started reading and it was so good! The book was about a girl by the name of Lily. She was 14 years old and had no mother. She was told by her father, T-Ray, that she killed her. Lily was sick of T-ray and decided to run away from him. She found a box with her mother's stuff in it and found the name of a town: Tiburon, South Carolina. Lily and her nanny, Rosaleen, ran away. Lily gets to Tiburon and is looking for the black Mary on anything. She soon found it in a grocery store. It was on a honey bottle. She asked where it was from and the grocery store guy said it was from and he told her. She finds herself face to face with a bright pink house. She meets June Boatwright and then August Boatwright. She asks if she can have a place to stay and August gladly accepts her. Lily then lives in the honey house with Rosaleen. May Boatwright is the next person she meets, then the Daughters of Mary. She loves all of them immediately, except June. She doesn't get along with her. Then she meets Zach and starts to like him. Lily lies to all of the people I just mentioned for a while and eventually the truth had to come out. She tells August everything. Many other things happen so I recommend you read the book. 
	I really liked this book and would recommend it because it is full of suspense and action. A few things might even surprise you! It's a book you will want to read over and over again. I thought the author's message was that life is short and everybody has things in their life that they're not proud of. I learned that people's lives are hard and they need at least one good friend that they can rely on. People are not always as they seem even if they pretend everything is perfect."
58,The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,0142437174,"Mark Twain, John Seelye, Guy Cardwell",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"This classic of American literature is perhaps the most misunderstood and maligned book since the Bible.  Nobody who has ever actually read the book could ever call it racist.  True, it is filled with the 'N' word that decent people find offensive, but it was necessary in the context.  This wonderful book is just as powerfully anti-slavery as 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' by Harriett Beecher Stowe, but while her book is still praised, Mark Twain's book is being banned from high school libraries.  I first read this book at age 12, and have re-read it at least every two years ever since.  I'm in my 40's now, but Huck and Jim take me right back to 12 every time I see them again."
58,The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,0142437174,"Mark Twain, John Seelye, Guy Cardwell",Barnes and Noble,3.9,3GildeRJ,"""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,"" by Mark Twain,  is a book about Huckleberry Finn, the namesake of the book.  Continuing the events of the last book ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,"" Huck is living with  widow Douglas, who has adopted him.  Huck gets bored of the widow trying to civilize him, he runs out and his abusive father finds him.  His father takes him in, and Huck tries to get out.  He finds an old saw and cuts his way out of the house and fakes his own death.  He catches a canoe and hides out on Jackson's island, Huck finds the widow's slave, Jim, who is also hiding out.  Tom and Jim build a raft, and escape down the river.       During their trip, Huck and Jim meet a few colorful characters, including two feuding families, and two cons who claim to be a king and a duke.  Huck may not seem so, but he is very clever, and able to see through the king and dukes' antics, which makes him sick to his stomach.  Huck is always trying to do good, and sometimes has a conflict with himself in deciding exactly what is good.  One night, he even thinks about turning Jim in, because he feels bad for helping the widow's slave escape.  He tells two white men in a canoe to check the raft, claiming his sick uncle to be on it.  He ends up convincing them that his uncle has smallpox, so they give him 40 dollars and leave him alone.         I think that this book is great.  One of the best I've ever read.  This book's plot may be a little over-used, a boy helping a slave escape from his master, but you never really know what's going to happen.  Mark Twain is one of the best authors from whom I've ever read.  This book easily makes me want to read some other books of his.  There are twists, turns, and, like a punch to the face in a dark room, you never see them coming.  If your okay with a few politically incorrect words (The book was written in the 1800s, when slavery was legal) and you love adventure, I definitley recommend this book to you."

59,Charlotte's Web,0064410935,"E.B. White, Garth Williams, Rosemary Wells",Barnes and Noble,4.5,AnastasiaSS,"Charlotte's Web is an amazing book. When I was younger, I never wanted to read it. I have watched the movie and loved it. Now I am homeschooling my daughter and this book popped up for a novel requirement. She was against it at first. But from the very first moment of us reading it together--we were both hooked. I woudl limit it to 2 chapters per day. And after reading those 2 chapters--we both wanted to read more. It was a very hard book to put down. We both loved every minute of it. And i enjoyed reading this book (at the age of 35)--more because I read it with my daughter. We laughed together, we cried together. Imagine me, a 35 year old mother cryong when Charlotte died. This book is truly a wonderful peiece of literature that everyone should read. A true classic. However--now my daughter is begging me for a baby pig. Someday--she will read this to her children and they will hopefully beg her for one also."
59,Charlotte's Web,0064410935,"E.B. White, Garth Williams, Rosemary Wells",Barnes and Noble,4.5,onlyminordetails,"My Thoughts:

I chose to reread Charlotte's Web for Banned Books Week this year mostly because I haven't read it in probably more than 15 years. I did read it numerous times growing up, so I remembered a lot of it. What I took away this time around was probably more than I ever took away back then though. Most of you already know the story, so I won't go into that. What I will talk about is how the book made me feel.

One of those things was Fern. She was loving and caring and full of life. She knew what was going on with the animals and she talked about it all the time. There was something extra special about her. I think what got to me was how much she just enjoyed the simple pleasures in life. Sitting on the stool by Wilbur's pen, taking in the sights and sounds. How many of us get to do that anymore? How many of us wish we could do that right now?

Of course, there was also Charlotte. Wonderful and amazing Charlotte. Her outlook on life and her wisdom are amazing. The way she and Wilbur interacted touched my heart. Wilbur learned a lot about life from Charlotte, and in the end he became the terrific pig she always knew he could be. The absolute best thing about their friendship can be summed up in this conversation between the two of them:

&quot;Why did you do all this for me?&quot; he asked. &quot;I don't deserve it. I've never done anything for you.&quot;

&quot;You have been my friend,&quot; replied Charlotte. &quot;That in itself is a tremendous thing.&quot;

That quote... typing it out is bringing the tears to my eyes. It's such a beautiful quote.

Reading Charlotte's Web by E.B. White again brought back so many memories and caused me to have a brighter outlook on life. Friends are important, helping each other is important, enjoying the simple things in life is important. If you haven't read this one since you were a kid, I strongly recommend that you read it again sometime. It will warm your heart just as it did before. I am certainly glad I took the time to.

My Rating: Exceptional"

60,The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,1400032717,Mark Haddon,Barnes and Noble,4.1,NRtrack,"I knew from the very start i was going to like this book.  Haddon, the author, writes this book from the point of view of an autistic child.  I personally know people that are autistic and Haddon did a fantastic job of capturing day-to-day life of an autistic child.  When i started reading the book, i realized that it would not be like any book I have ever read.  Like any book it started of with chapter one, however, the next chapter was numbered three.  In the beginning of the chapter the boy (who is writing this book) went of on a tangent explaining that the chapters will be prime numbers because prime numbers make him feel calm.  I enjoyed it because some books get boring because they have a plot and all you do is read about it.  However, every other chapter in this book diverted from the main plot to talk about something random, because this is how the mind of an autistic child works. Throughout the book i found my self almost getting annoyed by the way the boy acted, then i realized this is because the author did such a great job of captivating the real life of an autistic child.  This is written by a British man so the language is very harsh.  If you want a great book to read, this is it"

Only on about page ten, I found it hard to put down. No doubt, looking at life through an autistic boy's eyes was different, yet intriguing at the same time. Christopher Boone speaks his thoughts, and they made me think of life in a way I hadn't before. There were basically two plots in this book: Who killed Wellington, and if his mother's dead, where is he getting these letters from? Nonetheless, a good read that was full of mystery until the very end."
60,The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,1400032717,Mark Haddon,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"This book is a very easy read.  It is written from the perspective of a autistic fifteen year old.  Although some people say this book was poorly written and did not have a good plot.  The story was not a story to tell about how the autistic boy discovered who killed the dog, but rather a story to show what life is like for people with special needs.  Having some experience with mentally disabled, I found this book super interesting. It shows that people with disabilities are not stupid.  This boy was great at math.  I know a guy with down's syndrome who could tell you the day of the week you were born on within five seconds of you telling him the date of your birth.  This book was written to have a profound meaning.  Instead it was written to show that people with disablities are still people."

What happens when you know information on a missing person but no one will believe you because you are an &quot;unreliable witness?&quot;  That is what Rachel, the main character in this book, is going through in this thriller that is completely reminiscent of Hitchcock's Rear window.  It was written from the prospectives of three different women.  All characters are train wrecks waiting to happen.  It was like watching a wreck happen in slow motion.  There were lots of twists and turns and just when I thought I had it pegged, I would find out something else and be steered in a different direction.  

Though I did not care much for any of the characters, the book was extremely well written.  The author did an amazing job of building the intensity of the plot.  It did start a little slow, but as the story progressed, I just could not put it down!  I had to find out what happened to Meghan -- the missing girl.  The author also did a great job of portraying the life of an alcoholic.  She hit the nail on the head with that one.  

Anyway, incredible job for a debut book.  I absolutely will be looking for more from this author.  Thanx Ms. Hawkins for a fantastic read and a night of no sleep!   :~)

61,The Girl on the Train,1594633665,Paula Hawkins,Barnes and Noble,3.9,isniffbooks,"I hope unputdownable is a legit word because it most definitely describes THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN! So glad to report that 
THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN definitely lives up to all the pre-release buzz and anticipation!

So I begin on page 1 (where else?!) and I&rsquo;m reading, reading, reading &mdash; there&rsquo;s just this hard-to-define quality that makes it so 
easy to get sucked into the story right away &mdash; and I&rsquo;m turning page after page, and then, bam! The next chapter switches to 
someone else&rsquo;s point of view. I should have expected this since the first chapter was titled Rachel, but the chapter heading 
was just something I noticed and promptly forgot about as I dove into the story. And I was like, who is this new person?! What about 
Rachel?! What is going on?! But I ended up loving how the narration changed for each chapter &mdash; it leaves readers wanting more 
because Hawkins often concludes chapters with mini-cliffhangers or an unexpected revelation.

And speaking of narration, I really liked how things (a vague term, I know, but I don&rsquo;t want to spoil anything!) were revealed. Little 
clues, from the past and present, that just paint a bigger picture as to who the characters are and what brought them to their 
present state-of-affairs. I loved how with the drop of a sentence, Hawkins could completely change what you thought was going 
on with someone and their situation. This same effect can also get you to empathize with an unlikable character &mdash; because 
these characters are definitely flawed and have their own issues and secrets.

I stayed up well past midnight to finish up THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN. I will admit though, I was a tiny bit disappointed in how things 
were revealed (starting around page 260 or so) and wrapped up. But overall, I really enjoyed my reading experience &mdash; I even 
gasped aloud a few times startling my husband out of his own reading reverie. THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is an impressive first 
novel and I&rsquo;d definitely read whatever Hawkins writes next.

As a side note, there is profanity in this book. However, the explicit language choices did make sense in character and context so, 
much to my surprise, it didn&rsquo;t end up being an issue for me.

Disclosure: I received a complimentary review copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest review. The opinions are my own."

Second... where do i begin in saying how good it is? The world feels fully formed and the writing is breathtakingly good. The character are all well thought out and are multi dimensional. The plot has just the right amount of twists. And the story is incredible.

Yes this book was written as ""an atheist response to narnia""... but it goes so far beyond that as to become a fully fledged fantasy classic on its own merits. Give it a read - you will not regret it."

If you dont like it because you think it attacks god, that doesnt mean it isnt a good story. Im christian, too, i 
understand, believe me. But all of you are overreacting. If you dont agree with it, leave it alone. Its not like one series will destroy your entire religion. Its not like its trying to prove god isnt real. Its just a fantasy. And all of you who dislike it because you think that just wont look past your church to see reality. Its obvious. Instead of making a hateful comment like the church tells you not to do, just read something else for god's sake."

63,Wuthering Heights,0393978893,"Emily Bront??, Richard J. Dunn",Barnes and Noble,3.9,mmillet on LibraryThing,"Supposedly one of the 'great' love stories of all time, I have always felt Catherine and Heathcliff's relationship was selfish, manipulative and just plain weird. I could never understand why she felt she could marry Linton and still have Heathcliff on the side and that Edgar would accept him too. I guess she could see herself aiding Heathcliff in the process, but I just can't see how she could rationalize that. Maybe it is just a bitter reminder of how stringent class distinctions were in that period. For the longest time I felt nothing but disgust for Heathcliff until after thinking about this book for some time: he may be vindictive, mean spirited and low but he did have a rough life where he was mistreated at every turn. I think his one redeeming moment was when Cathy and Hareton were starting to connect and he couldn't bear to punish them -- perhaps he did have a heart if only it lay beneath layers and layers of darkness. This time around I actually felt like Catherine was more the villain than he ever was.I'm glad I reread this one from an adult standpoint. I know that love isn't always passionately destructive and all consuming -- but 'Wuthering Heights' truly is an engrossing tale. I highly recommend the recent Masterpiece adaptation, it was fantastic!"

64,My Sister's Keeper,0743454537,Jodi Picoult,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"I have not read an intriguing and interesting book in a while.  So, I was in search of ¿one of those books that you can hardly put down¿. As I skimmed through a list of various best-selling novels, I came across My Sister¿s Keeper by Jodi Picoult, which was recommended to me. Immediately I picked up the book and began to read. Sure enough, this book was nearly impossible for me to stop reading. After reading this book, I gleaned that Picoult is a fascinating writer, and this was definitely no banal story. If you are in search of a brilliantly written novel with a very interesting story line, then I would definitely recommend My Sister¿s Keeper by Jodi Picoult. 	My Sister¿s Keeper is the story of a thirteen-year-old girl, Anna Fitzgerald, who was conceived as a bone marrow match for her older sister, Kate, who has leukemia. Anna has been a donor for Kate her entire life, and this story revolves around her sudden opposition and dilemmas regarding this situation. The reader is immediately enthralled to the plot the moment Anna makes an astonishing decision in one of the beginning chapters, which the rest of the story revolves around. My Sister¿s Keeper is also the story of family life and revolves around the family¿s struggle to maintain their love and support for each other. It describes how no family is perfect, and forces you to love the Fitzgerald family and feel their pain through their many hardships. It was very difficult for me to put the book down and stop reading because I was so anxious to discover the ending result of this predicament that takes place throughout the entire novel. I was shocked by the unwonted resolution, however was very satisfied. I believe this is an ideal ending because the reader cannot even predict how the story will conclude, and it is a summation to all of the present conflicts. Picoult does an excellent job at writing this end result.	The author of My Sister¿s Keeper, Jodi Picoult has a very unique and compelling writing style that gets readers hooked to her books instantaneously. Her use of description is extremely skillful, and I felt as if I were present in the plot of the story. A component of her writing that I liked was her use of numerous flashbacks. I enjoyed reading them when they appeared because it helps the reader to understand the current situation or feeling she is writing about. They were often very interesting to read, and they gave me great insight to future events in the book. Another characteristic that I am pleased by is the fact that each chapter in the novel is told by a different significant character. I value this because it is interesting to see each person¿s perspective and feelings on a certain event or circumstance. By doing this, Picoult also creates a sense of unbiased feeling. It restricts the reader from having an unfair opinion about a specific character, and allows them to create their own opinions about each character. 	If you enjoy reading novels about everyday life and the complications that arise in it, then I would recommend My Sister¿s Keeper, by Jodi Picoult. Especially if you enjoy an intriguing storyline that is exceptionally well written, be sure to pick up a copy of this book. Picoult is an exceptionally fascinating writer, and after reading this masmasterpiece I will be sure to read one her other novels in the near future. It is a book of emotion, attachment, and suffering that keeps the reader interested for the entire story."

65,Slaughterhouse-Five,0385333846,Kurt Vonnegut Jr.,Barnes and Noble,4.2,jp_the_bookie,"I'm going into my junior year of high school in the fall, I read this book during the 1st days of my summer vacation because:
a) My English teacher told my class how amazing and absurb Vonnegut was and her plot synopsis captured my interest
b) The same English teacher spent all semester telling my class how are brains were turning to mush from reading Twilight/Harry Potter and that we should read more classics. So I decided to start reading CollegeBoard's 100 books for incoming college freshmen.

I was told from the get-go that this was a very very very eccentric novel and thats the kind of book I enjoy. I was very frustrated with myself up until about the last fifty pages because I did not understand the significance of the novel. However, the last fifty pages clicked all of the seemingly disconnected pieces together.

Mrs. Weil, my beloved English teacher, told us that if you cannot see the point of a piece of literature, you didn't read it carefully enough. This especially goes towards this novel, you have to read extremely closely if you want to understand or get something out of it. 

In the end, the book was very insightful and I suggest that everyone read it."
65,Slaughterhouse-Five,0385333846,Kurt Vonnegut Jr.,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"Set during World War II, Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five is a humorous antiwar book. Billy Pilgrim is a war veteran who becomes ""unstuck in time."" He seems to be obsessed with the aliens, called the Tralfamadorians, that supposedly abducted him and could see in the fourth dimension. Right off the bat, Slaughterhouse-Five has caught our attention. As we read through the novel, the way we experience it is the same as Billy sees time, disconnected and random. The book keeps jumping from time period to time period, thoroughly confusing the reader. In some places, Vonnegut makes himself a character in his own novel. It is confusing to the point that the reader has no idea if Billy or Vonnegut is talking.The novel makes us slightly disillusioned in the fact that we don't know the difference between real and fake. We are convinced (as is his family) that Billy is crazy and what he tells us about the Tralfamadorians is obviously untrue. But how are we to know if everything else he tells us of the war is true? The satire and irony in this book add comic relief to what would usually be a depressing scene, to our enjoyment.The genius of Slaughterhouse-Five is that Vonnegut seems so apathetic about war in places that we wonder why this is even considered an antiwar book. But the reality is that his use of understatement and reverse psychology arouses feelings in us. When he says war cannot be stopped, we think (more passionately than if he was agreeing with us) that yes, it can. When he says there is no such thing as free will, we say yes, there is. All in all, Slaughterhouse-Five is an enjoyable read, I highly recommend."

This was my first Kurt Vonnegut read several years ago and I've grown to love his work. This book is a great step for anybody interested in Sci-fi books. The manipulation of time in this book is brilliant.I liked the book...you just have to remember that it is about one of the first accounts of a person sufferring from 'post traumatic stress syndrom'. I don't think ptss was even named at that time. You just keep thinking that someone should do something to help him...but at that time, WHAT?A thoughtful description of war in how indescribable it really is to experience. It claims there is war and always will be war. You'd have better luck at stopping a glacier. Also that hell is better than war. Since at least there would be no innocents suffering. Deals with things in a matter of fact tone. Anytime someone dies he will say, &quot;so it goes.&quot; He gets lost in his own timeline and wanders. Aliens take pity on him and show him that time is something that humans can't grasp. Everything that happens always will happen, always has happened and cannot be changed. A downer. Oh and &quot;war is fought by babies&quot;. It's thoroughly glamorized in movies and fiction. The reality is usually a bunch of teens straight out of high school fighting those battles.In my opinion this is the kind of book I should have studied when I was in school. There is so much to this little book that it deserves more thought than the poolside read that was my investment. Having said that, this is a really good book and I would fully recommend it. I just wish that I could have discussed this in English class in school, I would be interested in hearing other peoples opinion and in developing my own"

66,Gone with the Wind,0446675539,Margaret Mitchell,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Anonymous,"Gone With the Wind is a novel that takes place in the antebellum South. Scarlett O'Hara, a stubborn, strong-willed, lively young girl, is the main character. The beginning of the novel starts with her ordinary life: attending barbeques, flirting with her beaus, and worrying about what to wear. As the novel goes on, however, many trials, ultimately brought on by the war, turn Scarlett's world upside down, and all that she knows and takes for granted, disappears. These trials include escaping Atlanta when the Yankees come, remarrying twice, dealing with the death of her mother, and returning home to find that everything has changed. However, even though these would be a reason for anyone to stop living, the trials actually bring out how strong Scarlett really is, even though for the first 15-16 years of her life, she was pampered and lived in luxury. Through all of this, Scarlett believes she loves Ashley Wilkes, a boy from her childhood, brought up to be the epitome of 'good breeding'. She also has to deal with Melanie Wilkes, Ashley's wife, because in her despair, Scarlett rashly agreed to marry Melanie's brother, Charles. Most of Scarlett's main decisions are influenced by her infatuation with Ashley and her belief that they are supposed to be together. However, Scarlett's third husband, Rhett Butler, is the one she actually loves, although she doesn't know it. Rhett is the opposite of a gentleman in the eyes of the old-tradition Southerners, but his personality matches Scarlett. Both came from good families, but Rhett was disowned from his, and Scarlett goes against many of the lessons and etiquette she was taught. Underneath all the training, however, Scarlett is just as rebellious as Rhett and, she lets go of all her proper teachings to stay alive and support her family and relatives. She ends up not caring what others think, and holds onto the mantra of ""I'll think of it tomorrow"". Through her trials, she unwittingly comes to love and respect Melanie, even though she thinks she hates her for marrying Ashley. However, Melanie is the only woman in her life who actually really loved her. Also, Melanie is the one who makes Scarlett realize how much Rhett loves her, even though he never lets her know it. Because of this, Scarlett rushes back to Rhett, only to find that he ""doesn't give a damn"" anymore, but Scarlett's strong personality keeps her from breaking, and the novels ends with her words, ""tomorrow is another day."""

Life in Afghanistan is wretched enough, but to be a Muslim woman in Afghanistan can be lethal, especially after the Taliban come to power. This book is beautifully written and at times difficult to read, but it's also difficult to put down. Mariam and Laila are wonderfully-drawn characters that will stay with me forever. They made me know just how lucky I am to be an American woman, and how unfortunate life can be for Muslim women in Muslim countries. This book will break your heart, but it will also put it back together again. Highly recommended."
67,A Thousand Splendid Suns,1594489505,Khaled Hosseini,Barnes and Noble,4.6,ArcherPL,"Yes , I just finished Khaled Hosseini's second masterpiece and I am at cross roads of trying to pen down what the pages made me think and feel. Interestingly, I still haven't completed the Kite Runner but this one, I couldn't put down for a second. The first thing that strikes you about the book is the fact that it is the story of the lives of 2 women amidst a battered Afghanistan, spanning several decades, but more importantly, it is a story written by a man, completely from a woman's perspective. This is even more striking when you realize that this is the same author who made his readers' eyes sting with the accounts of ""Baba Jaan"" in the Kite Runner.

I am in no way qualified to critique this masterpiece but I don't want to lose the essence that it left me in me today. As one reads the book, one is made brutally aware of the atrocities that are lashed out on women in different levels of society in different ways. One feels a sense of revulsion towards fundamentalism in all its forms. One is apalled at how close to truth, some of these pages probably are. Yes, the storyline speaks to one geographical area and one socio-political community, and yet as I went through the pages, the paragraphs that left my face moist with tears were not the ones that shouted atrocities, rather the ones that would resonate with any woman today, in any part of the world, in any community, in any faith.

Whether it was the unshed tears of an incomplete love story, or the sorrow of a woman to lose her child even before the little one made an appearence in this world; whether it was the joy of the same woman to find opportunities where she could be a mother in ways that completed her very existence without ever giving birth; whether it was that friend who would kill for you; that friend who would die so you could live your dreams; at the end of the day this was a story of the best and worst facets of human relationships. No one is without frailties, least of all a woman, and yet what makes you look in awe at the 2 principal characters in the book is their very imperfection; their inability to probably fight their circumstances and yet their ability to be the best they can be.

The book makes you look at reality head on, makes you lock eyes with the most brutal beast that can get you down, some call it fate, some call it circumstances, I call it my reflection in my mirror. You truly are your own worst enemy if you let that reflection determine your image rather than the other way around.

Laila and Mariam - the 2 principal characters in the book, didn't live, they merely existed, but somehow in all that they went through, their spirit shone with a radiance that can only be a gift of the Divine. Yes, they are characters from a work of fiction, but as I started to look around me, I realized I have the privilege of knowing a lot of women who may not suffer the physical adversities that Laila and Mariam did, but mentally they could have been reduced to a shell of a human being. Yet these women not only survived but have done so with pride, dignity, with their heads held high. We"

It's basically about a boy and his first year in high school. That's the one thing young readers need to watch out for because (I'm sorry to say) high school isn't exactly... uhmm... appropriate all the time, as shown in this book. The Perks of Being a Wallflower has very deep, easy to connect with characters and a plot that won't let you put the book down. Because of it's high school setting I wouldn't recommend this book for people under 13, but if you think you can handle the story without your parents flipping out too much, than go for it, cause this book will leave you with 100 hundred that aren't even yours. There are parts where you WILL cry (I guarantee it), parts where you will want to scream at the top of your lungs and not care who stares at you, and parts that will throw a smile on your face....not PUT a smile on ur face but that smile will THROW itself there.

My math teacher is pretty, in her early 20's, and a conservative Bible-thumper, so I was curious to what she saw in it. Once I see somebody with a book in their hands, I become very nosy. Her rave review convinced me to read it. 

What can I say about this book is that it's very fun and entertaining. I read it in one day. The sci-fi itself was pretty basic, and the most interesting part for me was Ender's trials at Battle School. Even though I had trouble following the null gravity battles. I did not understand Ender's explanation at all. It seems I would not be fit for Battle School :( 

The most unbelievable part for me was the age of these kids. They were very young, yet talked like your average adult. I understand they were supposed to be genius's and everyone was chosen as the best in something, but the only I saw that in Ender. I wish I could have known the other characters more. 

The ""twist"" ending didn't surprise me as much as the final chapter did. It just seemed so completely different from the rest of the book. I'm not sure whether or like it or not. This book definitely made me think in places. 

Overall, I recommend it to sci-fi and non sci-fi fans alike. I'm interested to read the sequels to see what happens to their universe afterward, if I can find them at the library. The library has a nasty habit of only carrying some books in a series- and never the ones I want."
70,"Ender's Game (Ender's Saga, #1)",0812550706,Orson Scott Card,Barnes and Noble,4.5,JGolomb,"I'm not sure how I've never made the time to read Orson Scott Card's ""Ender's Game"". It came to my attention about 15 years ago because of it's prescient inclusion of something like the Internet - a supercomputing, connected and communication experience. Viewing Ender's ""desk"" through the lens of 2010, one can't help but also applaud Card's anticipation of the iPad.

The book is not standard sci-fi fare. Oh, it has its aliens (called ""buggers"" throughout the book), space- ships, travel, and battles, but it has much more than that. It has a unique depth. After reading it, I see now why schools are including it on their reading lists.

Ender is a genius. A six-year-old genius. It becomes clear early in the book that Ender's intelligence is ridiculously off the charts, even by the standards of Card's fictional future. Card's mastery is on full display in how deep and dimensional he's able to make the characters. Like many children who have some distinguishing characteristic, whether it's a good or bad, Ender finds those characteristics under attack. He's very withdrawn, insecure and closed off to most of the real world. I couldn't help but feel Ender's claustrophobic view of his world.I couldn't help but feel his anger, frustration and outrage.

I'm looking forward to reading more on Ender Wiggin. But like Ender, I need to step away for a while. I need some fresh air. I need to stretch out and catch my breath before I re-enter Ender's game...and Orson Scott Card's world."

I am only sorry that I waited so long to read this gem. Card has kicked off his Ender Wiggin series in grand fashion here. With all the sclock coming out of hollywood these days, it would be nice to see a faithful screen adaptation of this novel- it could not go wrong.

71,Frankenstein,0141439475,"Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Maurice Hindle",Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"This is a very misunderstood story that sparked a concept that took on a life of it's own.  There is no scary castle, no hunchback, or villigars with pitch forks!  It is a story not about a monster but about what could happen when man kind tries to play creator.  You end up feeling sorry for the creature."
71,Frankenstein,0141439475,"Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Maurice Hindle",Barnes and Noble,4,jenmaynard,"Often considered the first science fiction novel, Mary Shelley had the creative spark for Frankenstein at the age of 18 and first published it as a 22-year-old. A story inspired by other gothic writings, contemporary scientific theories, and by tragedies in her own life (the death of her young child, a father who had disowned her), not to mention her poet husband Percy Shelley (who would drown the following year) and the philosophies of other poets in her young and influential circle of friends, this novel is a thought-provoking and ground-breaking work that has inspired countless stories about our desire to overcome death and our search for what it means to be human. It's not your modern horror thriller or what is generally depicted in film (instead of grunts, Frankenstein's real monster is eloquently tragic), the plot is often plodding, and some current readers might not find this a good read. But for those who enjoy a more philosophically centered gothic tale, Frankenstein is immortal."
71,Frankenstein,0141439475,"Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Maurice Hindle",Barnes and Noble,4,songcatchers,"My first thought on completing Frankenstein was this: I love this book! I really didn't know what to expect when I began reading this. We've all seen Frankenstein and his ""monster"" portrayed through numerous media outlets and I wasn't sure how any of these compared to the original story created by Mary Shelley. From page one I was drawn in and riveted by the narrative. I was hooked on Victor Frankenstein with his ambition and his creation who showed such strong emotions. Frankenstein's creation is an infantile being born into the body of a monster. We watch as this ""monster"" teaches himself writing, language, geography, history. He reads from Milton's Paradise Lost and from Plutarch's Lives. Learning brought such joy to him. It was so sad to see the ""monster's"" attitude toward man (and especially Frankenstein in particular) go from such love and delight to dark feelings and hate. Frankenstein and his race pushed the ""monster"" away and shunned him because he didn't look like them. They never gave him a chance to prove his worth among them. I believe it was society that created the ""monster"", and not soley Victor, but it was Victor who reaped the punishment. Frankenstein, the novel, brings up some thought provoking questions dealing with science and life and what it means to be human. You'll have to read the book yourself and draw your own conclusions.""So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of Frankenstein-more, far more, will I achieve: treading in the steps already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation."""

72,The Shining (The Shining #1),0450040186,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.5,CatherineMac,"Are you intrigued by eerie, gruesome novels that frighten you? If so, The Shining, by Stephen King, is a commendable novel for you. In this novel, the Torrance family consists of three members: Wendy, Jack, and Danny. The Torrance family is struggling because Jack loses his job as a writer/teacher at a college University due to his alcoholism. In order to break the habit and keep his marriage from falling apart, he takes up the job offer as a caretaker at The Overlook Hotel. The Torrance's will be the only people occupying the hotel from winter until spring rolls around. They will be essentially trapped in the hotel until after winter because of the heavy snow. Danny, who is accompanied by his imaginary friend Tony, has the ability to see into the future. While at the hotel, Danny, Jack, and Wendy begin to experience weird happenings. The giant, animal shaped hedges appear to move, and Room 217 is haunted  by a dead lady. Danny tells his parents that he has a bad feeling about the place and that he keeps seeing things, but they reassure him that everything will be fine even though they are seeing things as well. Jack's temper has begun to grow worse like it did when he was a drunk. Little do they know, the hotel is slowly leading Jack to insanity and that they are about to take part in a gruesome, frightening battle for their lives. 
	The Shining was beyond interesting. The beginning of the novel is somewhat slow, but the rest of the book draws you in until the very end. One of the reasons I loved this novel was because the way Stephen King set up the book. He would build suspense and then leave you hanging in order to update you on what was happening in other parts of the hotel. Therefore, making it impossible to put down. The other reason I loved the book was because I felt like I knew the characters in the story and that I was actually there with them. The Shining is an outstanding novel that will keep you on the edge of your chair until the last page.

73,"The Host (The Host, #1)",0316068047,Stephenie Meyer,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"This was just the greatest book!  I actually liked it quite a bit more than the Twilight series - those just felt a little too young for me.  (Not to say they aren't very good.)  The characters in this book are amazing!  I got to love them so much, which is almost strange because I was so angry with most of them at first (for the way they treated Melanie/Wanderer.)  The plot had twist after twist and I couldn't get enough.  Despite its being over 600 pages, I read it in a few days.  I just couldn't wait to know what happened next!  Highly HIGHLY recommened!  (And I can't believe Kristina Marrick wrote a review on here!!!  I loved her book too!)"
73,"The Host (The Host, #1)",0316068047,Stephenie Meyer,Barnes and Noble,4.4,DinaFelice,"Stephanie Meyer does it again with a story as deeply compelling as those in her more well-known Twilight series. This time we are on an Earth that has been--almost--completely overrun with an invasion of parasitic aliens called 'Souls'. But these Souls aren't the bad guys. 

The book is told from the perspective of Wanderer, a Soul who has lead a varied life on numerous planets and yet has never found emotions as strong as those she feels in her new human host body. But there is a problem: this host belonged to a human named Melanie, a young woman who spent years fighting the occupation. And unlike Wanderer's previous hosts, who quietly faded into the background of memories, Melanie is not ready to go away.

As the story unfolds, the readers find themselves rooting for both Wanderer and Melanie. We want Melanie to escape the prison she is in yet we want Wanderer to be freed of the burden of another voice in her head. And we desperately want both of them to find Jared, Melanie's human boyfriend, a man they both share a romantic love for and Jamie, Melanie's human brother, a boy they both share a maternal love for. And as they learn not to hate each other while finding themselves in new and potentially dangerous situations, we want a happy ending for both of them, though that seems quite impossible.

As in her other books, Meyer draws each of her characters with strengths and flaws, with true humanity, both the good and the bad that exists in each of us. From the central characters to those on the periphery, we understand why they do the things they do and sympathise even with the monsters. The complicated love triangles and the thrilling scenes where fear of discovery is near help to round out this amazing book.

I literally found it difficult to put this book down. I kept reading until the wee hours of the morning, then picked it up as soon as I woke up (thank goodness it was the weekend). I finished it yesterday and I have begun re-reading it today.

If you liked the Twilight series, you will like this. If you like this, you will like the Twilght series. The things that make a story truly compelling--great characters, facinating plot, danger, joy, sacrifice, love in all its many forms--are Meyer's forte. I find myself anxiously awaiting her next book, whatever it will be."

I have read the book. It is over. For me, anyways. 

This makes me sad.

The reviews of this book make me sad, and also a little bit angry because when people say that a book like this is 'amazing,' I think that they do not understand.

This book was enormous.

Today I told a friend that I was reading a beautiful book called 'The Fault in Our Stars,' but that she had better not read it, because it was mine.

I understand Hazel.

This book was enormous, but it came and went very quietly. I do not want it to be a sensation. I do not want it to be sensational for anyone but me. I do not want it to be anything. I do not want it to be made into a movie.

I want it to be loved.

I am very conflicted.

I do not want people to read it who will not understand.

I think I understand.

I feel like I am breaking it. Everything.

But this is how I feel.

I wish that I had not purchased this book electronically, because then I could take the copy that I do not own wherever I go, pages folded, spine cracking, soft cover bent and loved and worn and used and perfect.

This book will blow your mind, one of the books I almost teared up in. The author greatest achievements in this book is how he builds gut wrenching tension after every chapter with the 100 day till and so on. And when you finally hit the climax you will be in disbelief. Oh and be prepared to fall in love with the most diverse and compelling characters ever written."
74,Looking for Alaska,0142402516,John Green,Barnes and Noble,4.5,AMorgan721,"I was pleasantly surprised by Looking for Alaska.  For me, it started out very young and teenager-ish, which is probably because.well, it's a book about a bunch of teenagers, doing very teenage things.  For a while I was thinking that I was just listening to a book that was going to be basically just that, teenagers doing teenage things; drinking, smoking, sex, and tormenting each other (yes, all of the above are included in this book).  I figured there was going to be some great disaster and a lesson learned and wam-bam, you've got a book.  The thing is, the book received several great reviews that I just couldn't give up on it.  People saying how great a book it was - usually ""people"" do know what they are talking about.well at least some of the time.

It took half the book - and then it happened, the great disaster I was talking about before.  The thing is, it's much greater than you wanted or expected.  And John Green is a genius, because by this time, you're laughing and enjoying yourself with these characters, so the blow is not just to the characters, but you feel it too.

So, no, this book is not about a bunch of teenagers, doing teenage-y things, no matter how much of it is included in the book.  It's a book about life. It's a book about very young people attempting to discover the meaning of life, love, true friendship, having fun, tragedy, depression, and even God.  I was so impressed with some of the things that the author included about God, and religion in general, and not just one but several different religions.  I am a Christian, and while he was simply skimming the surface of religions and religious beliefs, John Green nailed some things on the head, or at least included things that nailed it on the head.  My favorite religious section: the discussion about the lady (I can't remember names right now - and since this is an audiobook, no book to reference) who wanted to destroy Heaven and Hell because she wanted people to love God not because he could get them into Heaven, keep them out of Hell, but because God is God!  

Many of the reviews I had read said that due to the mature nature of some of the stuff in the book, it probably isn't for young teenagers.  I would have to agree.  There are moments when I felt like smoking and drinking and even sex was not glorified exactly, but it seemed normal.  And it is, somewhat, but as adults and parents, we should attempt to move and motivate for it not to be normal.  On the flip side, the consequences of some of these actions are shown throughout the book."

This is an outrageously funny book and yet sincere in it's look at the inside view of a gal with a few extra lbs and being single in the 90's. Still a national best seller. It is so much fun for anyone who tries to lose weight or is on a diet (isn't that all of us) in the course of the book she loses 72 lbs and gains 74 -- hilarious or is it? A droll sense of humor, a strong emphasis on how we look and how we relate to men-- will give any female reader much to think about and chuckle about too. Do you want to lose 7 lbs, stop smoking and develop inner poise-- well see how Bridget does or doesn't do all of that in Bridget Jones diary.Fast summer read-- great airplane reading, fun reading for a mom who has to read in short breaks between kids, food, family and chaos!

I read it over the course of 2 days and I loved it! There were several times throughout the book I busted out laughing. Of course, I am the target demographic (early 30's, single), so I could relate to a lot of what Bridget faced in the book. That's not to say women of most any age couldn't enjoy the read. I think if you liked the movie, you will like the book. And while some of the same scenarios happen in the movie as the book, they are generally in a totally different context. I'd go so far as to say the movie was ""inspired by"" the book rather than scripted from the book. If I'm ever feeling down-n-out, this will be my go to book.

The reason I gave it 4 stars istead of 5 is that I believe $12.99 is too much to pay for 1) an eBook 2) a book which is a total of 205 pages and 3) has been around for 11 years."
76,Sense and Sensibility,0141439661,"Jane Austen, Tony Tanner, Ros Ballaster",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"In Jane Austen¿s Sense and Sensibility, the classic tale of love and its consequences is told through the lives of the young and beautiful Dashwood sisters. Marianne, an imprudent and impulsive young lady, immediately falls in love with the handsome, yet unpredictable Mr. Willoughby, scandalously displaying her affection for him. Elinor, although always reserved and collected, also falls in love, but unlike her sister, keeps her affection for her admirer concealed even from those she dearly loves. Through the opposite characterization of the two main characters, Austen criticizes the folly of not leading a balanced lifestyle, whether it is cold and distant or spontaneous and brash. The novel also depicts the troubles caused by love in a society where wealth and social standing are top priorities. Through a variety of characters ranging from a frantic, gluttonous sister, to a humble and kind colonel, Austen condemns the social institutions of her time that encouraged the priority of wealth and status when forming an opinion of a person. Throughout the novel, readers are hooked, held in suspense as they eagerly await to discover the results of the Dashwoods¿ adventures with love. Humorous, heartbreaking, and humbling, Austen combines lessons of life, love, and society defining Sense and Sensibility as a classic."

As an avid reader, I almost always find the book to be ten times better than the movie because movies are limited by a number of parameters, namely ""time.""That being said, this is one of those occasions where the movie is so much better than the book.  The book was simply far too long, filled with page after page after page of endless errand running for a rude boss. We get it already!  The movie was able to get the point across much more dramatically AND QUICKLY by simply showing the boss toss one coat after another (indicating day after day) onto her poor assistant's desk. There were simply too many times I dozed off reading this book, but I labored on. The endless complaints about the useless errand running also got to me after a while, to the point where I simply didn't like the main character all that much anymore.  She didn't seem to have any self respect, and the explanation that she was doing this as a means to be able to pick anywhere she wanted to work after a year didn't seem plausible.

Little did she know that her boss would be the most demanding, overbearing, ruthless person in the world.
 
The author's style in the novel is simplistic.  The narrator is Andrea who takes the reader on a whirlwind adventure into her daily life. The plot line is predictable and the diction is colloquial. This book was entertaining due to the humorous language that the narrator uses.

If you are a recent college grad or have been there before, you will be able to relate to Andrea.  She struggles with making ends meet on a new college grad income while working in an industry that is obsessed with fashion and perfection.  Andrea also learns some important lessons around friendship by letting fear dictate her work career because of how intimidating Miranda was with her.  Her constant fear and 'marriage' to her work got in the way of her relationships.  As a result, she lost some trust with her friends, broke up with her boyfriend, and weakened relations with her friends.   

Lauren Wiesberger graduated from Cornell University then moved to New York to pursue her career as a magazine writer. However, for six months prior to this, she spent time in Europe backpacking with her boyfriend. When she retuned from her trip she realized she had no money and no place to live. So she applied for an assistant position at Vogue magazine to the editor in chief. Her boss had bizarre, demanding requests and made her work like a mad woman to the point where she became isolated with the world around her. She eventualy quit the position and she became a freelance journalist.  Lauren's own personal life is seen through the storyline in this book.

This novel is an easy read book that has simplistic word choice. It is also an escape from the everyday kind of book. If you like fashion and humor The Devil Wears Prada is an excellent choice for you."

And, of course, a timless classic. I had to read this book for my English Honors course and expected boredom. However, I was pleasently surprised-- I enjoyed it! It's the story of the Greek hero, Odysseus, after the Trojan War. On the start of his voyage home, he provokes Poseidon, god of the sea. Thus, releasing the god's wrath. Odysseus faces many obstacles, on account of Poseidon's anger, including an encounter with Cyclops, Circe, and the Sirens, and a journey to Hades' Underworld. I would recommend this book to anyone who appreciates classic literature. Though the language does take time to become accustomed to, the hardest part of this book is the vast amount of characters.

I bought this as a gift for a friend who was losing a dear pet.  I still gave it to her, but I was disappointed by this translation.

Unfortunately, the translation by Richard Howard lacks some of the heart of the tale, especially in many key places.  For example, the phrase ""L'essentiel est invisible pour les yeux."" is translated ""Anything essential is invisible to the eyes."" instead of ""What is essential is invisible to the eyes.""  or  ""The essential part is invisible to the eyes.""

I much prefer the translation by Katherine Woods."

The Glass Castle by Jeannette Wall is the type of book that makes you want to give your parents a hug and thank them for being such wonderful parents, no matter how bad they were. Wall was raised by free spirits who want their children to become toughened by life and believe firmly in survival of the fittest. Her mother wants to be an artist and not to be bothered by the inconvenience of feeding and caring for her children. Her father is brilliantly smart but also a vicious drunk. Every time I thought that her childhood couldn't get any worse, I would turn the page. Which is worse? The Christmas he lit the entire Christmas tree on fire (on purpose) destroying their presents or the time he chased his pregnant wife with the car through the desert at night until he pinned her against a rock wall. Wall's story of perserverance through adversity is inspiring and amazing. You can't help but admire the courage it took to survive what she did and accomplish everything she has since. I finished it last night, and today I realized I was a bit sad that I didn't have any more of their crazy life stories to read about!"
81,The Glass Castle,074324754X,Jeannette Walls,Barnes and Noble,4.4,NordicSun,"I've had the pleasure to teach a college class on memoir since 2002, but must admit I've never had watched a memoir garner such reaction, praise, attachment, and fervor in the class before this one. Readers in my course, both young and middle aged, are held by the divided souls in this book, by its perils, defenses for neglect, overcoming, awful truths, painful secrets, shame, sarcasm, love always love, wit, and pluck. Its style holds us, and its saga of overcoming moves all. You will put the book down upon finishing, but you will never be able to quit the Walls' family. 

Jeannette Walls has one amazing heart. I am honored that she has shared it with us."
82,Into the Wild,0385486804,Jon Krakauer,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,This book had a very powerful underlying message. For Chris it wasn't about going into the Alaskan wilderness with all of his loving posessions. He was seeking answers about where he was in his life and what it meant. I felt a strong connection to Chris in many ways. I feel that I have the same strong will and guts of steel that he posessed. Jon Krakauer kept me intently flipping the pages as I learned the story of Chris McCandless.
82,Into the Wild,0385486804,Jon Krakauer,Barnes and Noble,4.1,ClarrisaW88,"Inspiring story about letting go of the daily grind and giving up everything to taste life in the wilderness.

84,"Jurassic Park (Jurassic Park, #1)",030734813X,Michael Crichton,Barnes and Noble,4.6,coloradogirl14 on LibraryThing,"My favorite Crichton novel and one of my favorite novels of all time, mainly because the suspense is palpable, and most importantly, realistic.  What I love about Crichton's novels is that he is able to not only explain complicated scientific and technological concepts in layman's terms, but he is also able to make these concepts believable without insulting the reader's intelligence.  I was also impressed with the philosophical elements of the story, although I imagine some readers might consider this a too-obvious intrusion of the author's opinions.  Normally, I get frustrated with authors who attempt this, but somehow it works with Crichton and he has an interesting perspective on the inherent power of scientific discovery.  A fantastic techno-thriller and a fantastic story overall.  I've read Jurassic Park about twenty times and I plan to read it twenty more in the future."

85,The Giving Tree,0060256656,Shel Silverstein,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"This book 'THE GIVING TREE' by Shel Silverstein is a great book to read to children. It is a sad story but the lesson that it teaches is really valuable. This story speaks about the unconditional love the tree had towards the boy.When the boy was little he would gather the leaves,  climb up on her trunk and swing from her  branches. She would let him eat her apples and give him shade when he was tired. As he grows older he completely forgets about the tree. He remembers her only when he needs her.But the tree keeps giving him whatever the boy wanted. The man sells all the apples and even cuts her down to build his house. Even then the tree keeps giving whatever he wanted. When I read this book to my children , my daughter who is going to 3rd grade said that it was very mean on the boy's part to keep asking for more and more from the tree. My daughter hated when the boy cut the tree down to build his house. She was in tears when she read that page in the story. She told me that she will never be as mean as that boy . She was infact angry that the boy did not thank the tree even once. I think that this book helped my daughter learn the importance of give and take. I highy recomend readers to read this book to their young ones and also teachers to keep this book in their classrooms. I think it is a great book to share."

86,A Time to Kill,0385338600,John Grisham,Barnes and Noble,4.4,JessLucy,"Horrifying and somehow beautiful at the same time; Grisham tells the story of a family shattered and a town rocked by a horrific crime committed against a child. The trial Grisham describes is fascinating and heart-breaking in its process. The movie was good but the book is truly a work of art. The author has a skill for making the reader feel like he/she's actually right there during the trial. Grisham has outdone himself with this one! I also enjoyed The Chamber and The Partner by the same author. If you like John Grisham, you may also enjoy: Philip Margolin, Tami Hoag (Ashes to Ashes, Dust to Dust and a Thin Dark Line especially, and Michael Connelly."
86,A Time to Kill,0385338600,John Grisham,Barnes and Noble,4.4,DorothyNC,"I read this book for the first time at least 12 years ago. It was not the first John Grisham book that I read but it is, and will always be, his BEST! I could not put it down until I finished it. Unforgettable!!"
86,A Time to Kill,0385338600,John Grisham,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"A Time to Kill by John Grisham is an excellent novel. The story takes place in the small town of Clanton, Mississippi. The story covers an uneasy relationship between blacks and whites. A black man named Carl Hailey kills two white men who are on trial for the rape of his little girl. The irony is that Carl Hailey is defended by a white attorney named Jake Brigance. The novel contains humor and action. The story is moving and emotional. I like that Jake Brigance is a young, white attorney who does what he feels is the right thing to do. He is so determined to keep Carl Hailey out of jail and let him return to his family that he suffers consequences in his own marriage and within the town. Some of the people around him treat him differently than before he made the decision to be Carl Hailey's lawyer. They don't understand why Jake wants to help a black man stay out of prison. My favorite part of the plot and the main point of the novel is that Carl Hailey would do anything to take revenge against the people who hurt his daughter, even if it means that he will have to spend the rest of his life in prison. Every parent would feel the same way. If my daughter was raped and tortured, I would want to kill those guys too. The obstacle is to encourage the jury to realize this. They would have done the same thing if they were in Carl Hailey's place. They need to look past the color of his skin and judge him on what he did. Although killing two men was wrong, his intensions were right. Carl Hailey did it for his daughter. The love that he has for his daughter is extremely touching."
87,Night (The Night Trilogy #1),0374500010,"Elie Wiesel, Marion Wiesel",Barnes and Noble,4.6,SarahAnn09,"NIGHT by Elie Wiesel is a piercing account of the horrors of concentration camp, which impressed an incredible toll both internally and externally on his being.  As a young adolescent, he is ripped from his home, plummeted to the depths of suffering, and driven to the edge of his own humanity.  Mr. Wiesel openly shares with readers the tremendous weight of these experiences etched within his soul.  His courage in doing so should be lauded.

From Mr. Wiesel we can learn that regardless of the burden from the sins of others imposed upon us and our own sins, it is possible to endure - and even to help others do so.  

In that vein, I would recommend another memoir to readers of NIGHT - called A BEAUTIFUL WORLD, written by Gregg Milligan.   It is a book you will not be able to put down - a deeply moving account of the indomitable human spirit as seen in the heart of a young child subjected to severe physical, mental and sexual abuse. 
   
In the author's own words, he shares his story to help others 'buckle down and bear the ride' through their own hell - and know that they are not alone.   A BEAUTIFUL WORLD is an incredible testament to the perseverance of hope.  Exquisitely written and heart wrenching, it is an unforgettable story.

Both A BEAUTIFUL WORLD and NIGHT offer readers a chance to adjust their own perspective on suffering through the examples of both authors.  Though they have suffered greatly and will never leave this experience behind, they will not allow it to end them either.   

Further, both authors possess the incredible courage to reach out and share their stories, giving of themselves for the benefit of others.  The astounding resiliency shown in that act alone speaks volumes of them as human beings -- and the words they press to paper will ever live on in the hearts of those that read them."
87,Night (The Night Trilogy #1),0374500010,"Elie Wiesel, Marion Wiesel",Barnes and Noble,4.6,OswaldoLMS,"I'm amazed by what humans are capable of doing to one another and this book shows how devastating the cruelty can be for some. Night is the story of Elie Weisel, who spent his life during the Holocaust and knew how  people were treated in the concentration camps.I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn how people were during the Holocaust."
87,Night (The Night Trilogy #1),0374500010,"Elie Wiesel, Marion Wiesel",Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"The book Night is a terrifyingly honest retelling of a holocausts survivor's story. Elie Wiesel, who was a teen when he and his whole town were forced into the camps, shows what really happened. He spoke of how everyone reacted, and showed how desperate everyone truly got when they realized how much trouble they were in. It offered a look inside the mind of one of the victims, and showed the constant battle they fought with themselves. Also, it put in his own experiences, showing how he felt during it. 
To start with, Night really captured the nature of humans perfectly. Some of the Nazis were cruel, while a few were simply there because they had to be. Some prisoners were helpful and nice, some were aggressive and selfish. He showed all sides of the people, that they're not all the same. 
Plus, the book also shows how his beliefs changed over time. As he was forced onto the cattle cars, he called himself religious. After years of starvation, abuse, and harsh conditions, he began to lose faith. By the time he escaped, he believed in only one person, himself. He let readers in on all he was thinking, not just what he was witnessing. 
Also, the novel is just well written. The flow is impeccable, with each even flowing seamlessly into the next one. The details Elie poured into this story really shine through. All of the sentences have a meaning, and aren't just some made up stuff to make the story seem more interesting. He turned his life story into a beautiful piece of literature.
In addition, he talked about his father and about how hard he tried to help him. Plus, he even admitted to sort of feeling a wave of relief when his father passed away. He loved his father, but after constantly helping him as they both grew weaker and weaker, as well as doing hard labor to survive, it's no wonder he felt a weight lifted off his shoulders after his father's passing.
To sum it all up, Night is a painful, but beautiful story. It somehow managed to capture the essence of desperation, and showed this off with ease. It also showed his own battles with faith. Elie remained truthful throughout; contributing to what makes this novel so breathtaking. He didn't shy away from the things he felt, he showed them to the world. Additionally, the book is just a magnificent piece of literature. Night is definitely a book worth reading."
88,Paper Towns,014241493X,John Green,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"The first book I read by John Green was an Abundance of Katherines. I was hooked. This brilliant man who I knew through Nerdfighting and Brotherhood 2.0 videos had a completely different, and yet the same, side. He could write far better than almost any modern author I'd read- and that was only his second book. I read An Abundance of Katherines three times after I got it, and promptly bought a copy for myself. Then, I heard about Paper Towns. I had to read it. If it were even half as good as his other books, then it would be a miracle. But it wasn't. It was exponentially more amazing. 

I read the whole book in one day. I checked it out from the library in the morning at school and read it under my desk in class all day long. In seventh period, I read the last sentence, having heard nothing of class all day, closed the book, amazed, and excused myself to go deliver the book to one of my friends, who had begged me to lend her the book when I finished it, in her math class. I couldn't wait to pass it on. 

Everything about Paper Towns screams MASTERPIECE like nothing I've ever read. In the first fifteen minutes after the final punctuation, Paper Towns beat out each and every one of my favorite books, some of which I've called my favorite since elementary school, and became my favorite book. 

The characters are real, alive, vibrant. You can feel the story and live it along with them. John Green makes you cry one moment and laugh your ass off the next, all in one fluid motion. This book... is amazing. I feel like I've known Q my whole life. Hell, I'm even ordering a Black Santa online. 

If you haven't yet, buy this book. Read it. You'll never, ever regret it. 

Everything about Paper Towns is just beautiful. I can't say it enough. My way of thinking was changed. My way of writing was changed. My way of talking was changed. My way of life was changed. This book, though it is printed on paper, is NOT a paper book, to be passed by. By no means 2-dimensional, this book is like the V for Vendetta of literature- everyone should experiance it. Paper Towns changed my life, and my perspective of modern literature. 

Buy this book."
88,Paper Towns,014241493X,John Green,Barnes and Noble,4.4,laughing_in_the_rain,"When I first started reading this book I was completely in love with it. It was one of those books where you laugh out loud, cry, and think a lot. I think we can all relate to some of the situations in this books. It was really amazing. It kind of teaches us that we can chase somebody across the United States, but in the end our fantasies won't become real. I really liked the characters in this story. I would be reading in class and just bust out laughing. It was really good and now it's one of my all-time favorite books."
88,Paper Towns,014241493X,John Green,Barnes and Noble,4.4,asamum,"The story has so many layers it was like peeling the layers from an onion only to discover more layers underneath.

Written in 1st person narrative, from Quentin's (Q's) perspective. Q was surprisingly easy to relate to even in my female dominated household. Q epitomises the boy next door stereotype. A good student and all round nice guy. John Green makes geek/nerd sexy.

Margo & Q are tied together by a traumatic incident in their childhood. Although no longer friends, Q has had a crush on Margo from an early age.  Following their night of adventure and Margo's subsequent disappearance, Q has to analyse how well he knows/doesn't know Margo.

The notion that we are different versions of ourselves with different people really comes under scrutiny within the narrative. How well do we really know someone when we only see a single side of them. In the same context how well do we know ourselves, when we are different with different people. There are a complex set of psychological theories beautifully entwined in the plot. 

Making Q's parents psychiatrists in the story adds an extra dimension to the analysis. Elements of the nature versus nurture debate especially with the contrasts between Q's parents and Margo's.

The use of Walter Whitman's poem Leaves of Grass within the plot adds another layer to the story (see what I mean about peeling the layers of an onion). The analysis of the poem parallels the analysis of people within the plot.

Q evolves tremendously throughout the book. At the start he has always been on the periphery of his own life. Through his search for Margo, he discovers who he really is. I think that is why finding Margo became a compulsion for him, as he was also finding himself.

I adored John Green's writing style, the use of metaphors & similes were fantastic. Decay never sounded so good :0)

A story about growing-up, self discovery, endings & beginnings. The realisation that the world is a big place and we are just a small part of the whole. A highly recommended read :0)"
89,The Princess Bride ,0345418263,William Goldman,Barnes and Noble,4.4,DylanJames,"The story is without peer. For folks who loved the movie, the extra texture and detail provided by the book is very rewarding.

However, this ebook presentation is inexcusably poor.  What am I talking about? Every other edition of the Princess Bride uses typography to distinguish Goldman's voice from Morgenstern's.  This is important, because there are many interjections by Goldman. The first edition of the book used red type for Goldman's voice. Subsequent editions used italics. With the richness of an electronic screen available, what does this ebook do? Absolutely nothing is what it does. The book says ""All abridging remarks and other comments will be in this fancy italic type so you'll know."" It says this in exactly the same non-italic type of the rest of the book. Hopefully, being an electronic item, this error can be fixed, and existing copies will be updated.

This makes it appear that in the production chain of an eBook, or this one anyway, there wasn't a single person who cared about the content of Princess Bride. This is our future! Please take better care."
89,The Princess Bride ,0345418263,William Goldman,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Hockney,"This is a classic novel of adventure, romance, sword fighting, revenge, magic and very big rodents. Funnier than the film, and with better special effects. Goldman's radical editing of Morgenstern's epic will appeal to anyone with a love of adventure, but who read the unabridged versions of books such as Don Quixote and Moby Dick and found them boring beyond belief. All the good bits, indeed.
And the format's been fixed - Goldman's comentary is now in italics."
89,The Princess Bride ,0345418263,William Goldman,Barnes and Noble,4.4,AMHblogger,"Wow, where do I begin? Being a big fan of the movie and critical of adaptations, this book was as close to perfect as you could possibly get! I absolutely loved it! The movie stays very faithful to the book; and the book is purely awesome. The book even contained the aspect that the story was being read to a child by an adult. Goldman took it even a step further and created an entire storyline outside of the actual Princess Bride story. The whole idea of abridging the &ldquo;original&rdquo; story by Morgenstern was fictitious, but it had me believing it was the truth. It wasn&rsquo;t until after finishing the book, I looked it up on the internet and found out it was fake; it was all part of the story. Very creative, I must say.

Aside from that, the main story of The Princess Bride was exciting, funny, and touching. The characters were deep, witty, and likable. It contained a great balance of romance, action, suspense, and witty humor. If you enjoyed the movie, you&rsquo;ll cherish the book. It gives greater detail and background to various characters not seen in the movie. 

This has undoubtedly become my favorite book by far. To think another story could outdo it is absolutely....

....INCONCEIVABLE!!!"

90,The Outsiders,014038572X,S.E. Hinton,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Anonymous,"S.E. Hinton's The Outsiders had to be one of the most moving teen reads ever written. This book can be read 100 times, and you'll still cry at parts and smile at other parts, even when you know what is going to happen.  
My good friend had first told me about this book and she started explaining how much she loved it and how it was about gangs, and I did a double take. At the moment, I thought she was crazy for obsessing over a book about gangs. Now, I see why she loves it so much. 
No one would ever think a book about Greasers and Socs would ever be this incredible. But it is, and the fact that Hinton had started writing this at the age of fifteen is amazing.
Incredible author and an incredible heart warming book that will live on forever."
90,The Outsiders,014038572X,S.E. Hinton,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Anonymous,"I had heard of The Outsiders before, and finally decided to read it on my own. I was absolutely stunned by how much it affected me. It is honestly the best book I have ever read, and this is coming from a die-hard Harry Potter fan. If you are going to read this, however, I would recommend reading the end in a private place, considering I literally sobbed for about twenty minutes, something no book has ever made me do. It's amazing!"
91,"The Maze Runner (Maze Runner, #1)",0385737947,James Dashner,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Hanna_thereckless,"I absolutely loved The Maze Runner. I first heard about it through an internet ad. It asked, ""Like the Hunger Games? Then you should read The Maze Runner."" It drew my attention because The Hunger Games is one of my most favorite books. So I started reading the ""preview"" of The Maze Runner on Barnes and Noble's website. There's something to be said for a book that I couldn't stay away from after the first sentence. I neglected my work and stared at my computer screen, reading. When I reached the end of the preview, I bought the ebook because I had to know what happened. It is a fast paced, action-packed adventure that completely sucks the reader in. From the very first sentence, I was simply dropped into the story; everything is from the main character's point of view. You only see and hear what he sees and hears. It was exciting, and I felt as if I was there.  
	 It is true that the characters could have been more deeply developed; they were certainly lacking in personality depth. Also, The Maze Runner is quite violent in parts: there is death and insanity and truly terrifying monsters. It is part of a new genre of books, all exploring the possible futures of this world. It is not a light read; it will have you up at night. However, if you loved The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, this is a book that you will enjoy just as much. I definitely recommend it."
91,"The Maze Runner (Maze Runner, #1)",0385737947,James Dashner,Barnes and Noble,4.4,brandyMD,"This book reminded me very much of The Hunger Games (FANTASTIC book & trilogy!)  This is written for teens, however I am an adult and both my 13 year old son and myself have now read it and thought it was hard to put down.  This is definitely one where you need to use your brain matter and think of the options involved.  You cannot help but feel compassion for the characters and your sense of emotion goes full speed.  As my son says, 'you feel like you are right there with them'.  (I must say, all of the same can be said for The Hunger Games as well)

Sure hope he gets the next book out sooner than later-it will definitely leave you thinking and ready for the next one ASAP."

92,"Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (Freakonomics, #1)",0061234001,"Steven D. Levitt, Stephen J. Dubner",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"This book is a general interest book- and it certainly is interesting. The book, for anyone looking for an entertaining read, will like it. In a nutshell, the book takes a look at all sorts of things in society, from crack gangs to parenting, and then attempts to make sense of them by applying econonmic principles. According to the book, economics is really the study of incentives, and so using this kind of angle, the book comes up with answers to why things work the way they do. A book that's hard to put down, I'm sure many readers will enjoy it. Also recommend The Sixty-Second Motivator for a more simplistic explanation of what motivates people and gives them incentives to do what they do."

92,"Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (Freakonomics, #1)",0061234001,"Steven D. Levitt, Stephen J. Dubner",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Pass,"Freakonomics provides the reader with the chance to take a new perspective on many different topics. It answers a seemingly complex question of why exactly drug dealers live with their mothers and shows how gangs are the reason why. This book is one that you would not want to put down and will want to read it through to the end. I would suggest that everybody reads this book and learn from it some very hard lessons. A chapter in the book describes how criminologists incorrectly found the answer to the 1990's crime rate drop and how that drop is linked to the legalization of abortion. Levitt and Dubner also show how everybody responds to an incentive, comparing the prices real estate agents get for their house versus their clients; also providing why a sumo wrestler is like a school teacher. This book shows the reader the hidden side of decision-making and how the economy works. It provides an insight to the world of economists and into the world of both psychology and sociology. From the book you can learn ways to bring patterns out of data (even though this wasn't an intention of the book) which is a very valuable skill to have. Another thing to learn is that common, conventional wisdom is mostly made up of lies and is created by ""experts"" in their own interest. It explains how those experts manipulate people by using their ignorance against them, and hopefully will teach the reader not to believe everything they hear. This book is one that every person needs to read at some point in their life, as it provides many different answers to life's questions and presents the method for answering those. Those methods can be used to answer your own personal questions and will help you out during your entire life."

When I first got the book I thought I would not be interested in it. However, I kept on reading and it got really good.  The story is very well told, it is easy to follow, the vocabulary is not very hard. You just have to be patient and towards the middle the story gets very interesting. Also at the end of the book there are questions about the story that makes you wonder how you would feel in Mary's situation.   My mom felt that this book would be a good introduction to reading good literature, and I agree. I felt it was very educational and appropriate for my reading level. I would recommend it to any girl or boy that is ready for some serious reading."

I had to do a book report and that was when my dad recommended this book to me. I was reluctant to read this book at first, however, I was quickly captured in the magic of this book. It truly opened a door to a new world of a journey in a land of Classic books. I cried while reading this book.. because I'm also very emotional.   It's about an arrogant, selfish, and lonely girl who discovers a secret world behind a door. Gradually through the stories she learns to smile, laugh, and be a child.

94,One Hundred Years of Solitude,0060531045,"Gabriel Garc??a M??rquez, Gregory Rabassa",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"One Hundred Years of Solitude is the most interesting novel I have read in a long time.  I was immediately drawn into the character development in the novel. Marquez tells the story in a way that makes the reader relate to characters that are strongly flawed. The family depicted is surprisingly realistic  although their lives are at times abnormally crazed. The magical, and at times tragic, events that occur through the story do not hinder the heart of the characters. The refreshing use of mystical realism is appropriately placed throughout the sometimes dark writing. While I was reading the novel, I couldn¿t help but smile at the witty details that were strategically used throughout. Although this book may be seen as dense and even random at times, the pure heart of the story shines through. When I first found the book, I was not sure if I would enjoy it, because it is a change from the usual novels I read. Once I completed the story, I was pleased that I chose to read this important piece of literature. After reading this novel, I feel that my views on society have changed. I would definitely recommend this book, because it is a worthy read."
94,One Hundred Years of Solitude,0060531045,"Gabriel Garc??a M??rquez, Gregory Rabassa",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"First and foremost, the prose in which this book is written is some of the most beautiful phrasing I have ever read. It reads extremely fast, but you have to be careful not to miss something. One paragraph can be three pages long, but one line in that paragraph can be something so powerful that it just tugs at your heart, so while it reads fast, also give it time to sink in. I've read reviews on here about how others have thought the characters were bizarre, or the events were explicit or unbelievable. It's magical realism, folks. This is part of the story, part of the heritage of the author and their nature of literature, and it's the biggest part of the story that brings the impossible to life. It's imagination, it's devotion, strength, love, lust, pain, jealousy and strife. I think that when most authors set out to write a book, they hope to capture just one of those feelings. Marquez captures them all, and he does it in such a way that no one else ever has before. I'm not going to give any details of the book. The pages speak for themselves. I only read these reviews after I read the book, just out of curiosity. I highly recommend not reading the book's description or anything that could potentially ruin the story. Just turn to page one, begin to read, and feel the power of this author's magic. It's truly overpowering."
94,One Hundred Years of Solitude,0060531045,"Gabriel Garc??a M??rquez, Gregory Rabassa",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"Although I haven't finished the novel yet (I'm half way through), I can understand the good and bad reviews. The author does have an interesting way of telling the story. My only complaint is some of the twisted behavior of many of the characters  I guess that's a part of the 'life changing' part of reading the novel.I liked the beginning and it does show the progression of civilization. It also examines government and the revolution in Latin America (yet it's still fictional). I just wish that the characters weren't so twisted. I would recommend this novel to more mature readers (also, if you notice, older/more mature readers liked this book  you need maturity to read through the semi-explicit scenes). I'm guessing that the plot is the changes that occur in civilization through time and what those changes does to the people involved."
95,The Picture of Dorian Gray,0375751513,"Oscar Wilde, Jeffrey Eugenides",Barnes and Noble,4.1,MDC_ColumbiaU,"""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" is a fantastic book, mixing excellent wit with poignant commentary on society, intertwined around a spiritual story about a man who sold his soul unwittingly, but unrepentantly.  Make sure you read this book, BUT ... buy a different edition.

The editor of this book, Cauti, included many intelligent and spectacular notes throughout the book, but he includes asterisks and cross-marks throughout the book so that you will check his footnotes.  These appear on 90% of the pages, and they ruin the flow of Wilde's prose because the reader is compelled to stop reading, check the footnote, and return to their previous position.  The rhythm of the writing is totaly disrupted whenever this happens, and it is fair to say that this happens often.  Often enough, in fact, that I recommend you buy another edition.  Not this one."
95,The Picture of Dorian Gray,0375751513,"Oscar Wilde, Jeffrey Eugenides",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"Believe it or not, I had not heard of The Picture of Dorian Gray until the movie League of Extraordinaty Gentleman came out.  I know, crazy right.  No, I havn't lived under a rock my whole life.  I don't know how i missed it.  Well, after seeing the movie I rented every movie of The Picture of Dorian Gray I could find and fell in love with the story.  Then I read the book... and fell in love with the writing.

Reading the first chapter is like being swathed in wonderful writing from head too toe.  I felt completely surrounded by it.  You can almost feel the warmth of the garden,  hear the sounds of the birds and dragonflies, and smell the beauty of the flowers as you sit and listen to this conversation between Harry and Basil.  The writing is an immersive experince.  And Basil's description of his first encounter with Dorian and the feelings that Dorian stirs in him, sound almost... romantic.  At the least there's definately a bromance going on.  And we also see the first crack of Dorian's facade in this chapter, which Basil's decsription of how Dorian sometiems seems purposefully cruel to him.  Isn't it interesting, the first chapter ends with Harry demanding to meet Dorian and dragging Basil into the house and we haven't even met Dorian yet ourselves.  

As I read the book it occured to me that it could also have been titled the Influence of Lord Henry Wotten, for Harry's (as he's called by his friends) opinions and influence are as central to the story as Dorian Gray himself and more of a factor than the portrait itself. Hardly a scene goes by that Harry, whether present or not, is not quoted as an authority. It was as if he was the potter and Dorian was the clay.  Harry was fully aware of his influence, and Dorian... Dorian seemed to be racing from one sensation to another like a spoiled child.

This was by far one of the best written, most interesting stories I have read.  I will read it over and over and would recommend it to everyone.

95,The Picture of Dorian Gray,0375751513,"Oscar Wilde, Jeffrey Eugenides",Barnes and Noble,4.1,theokester,"I knew relatively little going into this book...and what little I did know was from less than 100% accurate retellings such as in League of Extraordinary Gentlemen or references from cheesy shows or horror flicks (I think perhaps there was a reference in Scooby Doo somewhere?). I had the basic gist...there's a guy, Dorian Gray, who has some magical painting that ages while he stays young and wonderful forever. Not much to go on, but I was still excited to read it. I was pleasantly surprised that the book had much more depth to it. 

I was a little torn on my overall feeling for the book. It took me a while to get into it and there were long passages that were drudgerous to push through. However, from a high level, this is one of the better books I've read this year...or even for numerous years. It had a plenitude of intriguing themes that left me thinking in between readings. It had a lot of humorous quips and paradigms as presented by Harry that I laughed out loud at. It had surprising twists and tension that left me curious as to the true outcome (as opposed to that from rip-off stories). There are a couple of spots that could be considered ""climax""...the confrontation with the artist is the main turning point in the book. Personally, I would have rather seen more pages after that turning point than before it. I think the last 1/3 of the book was far more engaging. At the same time, the buildup was necessary to promote the intended mood. 

Overall, this is a book I definitely recommend, with the caveat that you should be aware that it does slow down at points. Just push through those. The overall work is worthy of a couple of slow zones. In fact, perhaps those slow zones serve the purpose of allowing more pondering."
96,"Fifty Shades Freed (Fifty Shades, #3)",0345803507,E.L. James,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"This series is one of the best series I've ever read in my life.  I've never read such a moving book ever.  In some ways I wished the story would continue but in some ways I'm glad the author wrote it the way that she did and ended it.  One thing is is that I wished that I knew what Christian was thinking throughout the story.  Since this is a first person book from Ana's perspective; that's all that we see.  

Hey E. L. please write the story again in Christian's point of view.  That would be awesome."
96,"Fifty Shades Freed (Fifty Shades, #3)",0345803507,E.L. James,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"I heard about the series on a tuesday morning and sunday I came up for air (and i am a full time working mother) i could not put the series down, i stayed up late, i was late for work
I blew off anything i could to get back to Christian and Ana. When it was all said and done --I missed so much what my husband and i had in the beginning. It reminded me that relationships are hard, but if i want to be happy... really happy... then it takes work. My husband used to call me 3 or 4 times a day (pre-tech) he used to dry my hair after we made love and took a shower. We used to never shower apart as a matter of fact... so many little things. Life is so hard and if we can find our way back to even a little bit of the jealousy,  the great sex, and being so into each other we cant stand it then maybe, just maybe, we wont end up on the down side of the statistics. Maybe... heres hoping."

Thank goodness for the Nook on Android.  This last book Fifty shades of Freed had everything you could ever want in a book.  Romance, Adventure, Drama, it was so exciting.  I laughed, I cried and I was even anxious and angry at times.  Absolutely the most amazing books I have ever read.  I loved the story of Anastasia and Christian.  I can not get these books out of my head and I am so sad that the journey is over.  I really miss reading about these two characters.  But I do love how it ended.  Thank you E.L. James.  I recommend these books to anyone who wants a good read and does not mind lots and lots of dirty kinky sex.  Loved it, Loved it, Loved it !!!!!!!!"
97,Dracula,0393970124,"Bram Stoker, Nina Auerbach, David J. Skal",Barnes and Noble,3.8,stephxsu on LibraryThing,"Dracula is pretty much known as the grandfather of vampire literature, and I was really excited to read it for my Victorian lit class. Sadly, however, it failed to appeal to me. Stoker badly needed an editor: there were distracting narrative inconsistencies all over the place. The characters seemed archetypal, but not in a good way. The women in the story were either highly sexualized or disturbingly victimized, an anti-New Woman novel if there ever was one. Overall, this book was a disappointment for me."

98,"The Girl Who Played with Fire (Millennium, #2)",0307269981,"Stieg Larsson, Reg Keeland",Barnes and Noble,4.3,bibliotek,"I was quite fortunate to have been provided with an advance reader's copy of ""The Girl Who Played with Fire.""  I had read, and loved, the first volume of this trilogy, ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.""  I am happy to report that I loved this second part of the story even more than the first.The book, like the first installement, is quite formidable in size, as it encompasses more than 500 pages.  Nonetheless, I tore through it in three nights.  I just could not put this book down; I had to reach the conclusion, searching for answers to so many puzzles posed during the narrative.  I found that the author again managed to write a most exciting, intriguing action story, while skillfully interweaving strong social commentary, particularly as against prostitution, the sex trade, and the horrid treatment of impoverished women with an utter lack of hope in their lives.The story reunites the reader with Lisbeth Salander, the fire-playing, tattoo-wearing young woman, who has to be one of the most unique fictional characters ever created.  Mikael Blomkvist, an honest, dedicated journalist also again commands our attention as the other  leading protagonist in the novel.  The book ends with quite a stunning turn of events (no spoiler here), which left me literally saying, ""WOW!""I most heartily recommend this book.  Again, the tragedy of the premature death of the author is truly felt."
98,"The Girl Who Played with Fire (Millennium, #2)",0307269981,"Stieg Larsson, Reg Keeland",Barnes and Noble,4.3,harstan,"Swedish Millennium magazine publisher and reporter Mikael Blomkvist is considering an expos&#233; of the extensive sex trafficking trade in Eastern Europe.  He knows the article will cause a stink in Sweden when the elite are exposed as participants.  However, just before the release of the damaging report, the lead journalists are murdered and the evidence including fingerprints on the weapon point to Lisbeth Salander.

With an outraged cry from the media and the government, some of whom headline the dead reporters' sex trafficking article, to hunt down this vicious killer, Salander knows she must put aside her beach reading of Fermat to uncover the real culprit.  Blomkvist knows the tattooed Salander is innocent and using his investigative skills as a crusader he also begins making inquiries.  

The second Blomkvist and Salander Swedish thriller is a super whodunit that brilliantly combines action-packed sequences with cerebral treatises.  The story line is fast-paced from the opening salvo and never slows down even when the heroine discusses mathematical theories as Blomkvist and Salander independently and united investigate the homicides with neither expecting the trail to take them to her past though their previous combined inquiry (see THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO) should have warned them.

99,"Fifty Shades Darker (Fifty Shades, #2)",1612130585,E.L. James,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Dana_CMD,"When I finished the first book in this series, Fifty Shades of Grey, I was very anxious to start Fifty Shades Darker. I have been an avid reader my entire life, but I've never read any books that invoke such a powerful feeling of reality and emotion as this series does. I had an urgent desire to find out what was next for Ana and Christian, I could so easily see both of them as being real. It was so easy for me to put myself in Ana's place, to be her, to feel what she felt, and to think her thoughts. I know that I am completely enamored with a book and it's characters when I feel as if my 'real life' gets in the way of exploring the world an author has set up for me, and that has happened with this series to the point that I am considering making an appointment with Dr. Flynn to talk about it. *grin*  
These two people come together quite by accident, and despite their issues (or maybe because of their issues), find something MORE together...and truly, isn't that what we all are really searching for in life?"

Honestly, I wanted to stop after the first, but I find it hard to start something and not finish.  The writing style is HORRIFIC.  6th grade level, if even that.  Once I learned it was written as Twilight fan fiction, it made more sense.  I couldn't imagine a serious author writing in this manner.  If I have to read about her &quot;inner goddess&quot; and how Christian smells, or how hot he is, ONE more time, I may fling this book across the room!  It's just 300+ pages (per book) of sex and redundant cliches.  I'm baffled by all these 5 star reviews!"

100,The Poisonwood Bible,0060786507,Barbara Kingsolver,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Hygd,"As a former missionary kid (Mish-Kid) this book brought back tons of memories.  I have seen real-life characters that would have fit so comfortably within the pages of this book.  The book, I believe, would be a fantastic read for many.  I definitely would not say for everyone.

Not too many people will read it on a nostalgic level as I did, and for some others who grew up similarly to me, it would bring back emotions and memories they would best forget.

It brought back memories to me of the missionary to Borneo who spoke at my school when I was a 13 year old kid.  He finished speaking and then invited all who would promise to someday go to Borneo as missionaries to stand, making public affirmation of this promise.  No one stood.  We were 13.  Who knew what tomorrow would bring?  The speaker, however, did not free us from the bonds of this assembly.  He kept repeating the ""invitation"".  After countless entreaties, we all stood up at once.  We'd had enough and were ready to get back to doing the things we wanted.  The speaker was thrilled.  Did he think that his message had reached us?  As far as I know, no one has gone on to missionary work in Borneo and I am now in my late 50's.

There was another fellow who sought to bring down the walls of Jericho.  Jericho being a local bar.  He and his church members marched around their Jericho, playing hymns with a trumpet and singing every night for some time...enough to bring down the walls of any modern day Jericho, if not at least to bring in the local authorities.  

I totally enjoyed Poisonwood.  I knew the people within its pages.  Great book."
100,The Poisonwood Bible,0060786507,Barbara Kingsolver,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"Before I read this book for a literature class, I had read some of Barbara Kingsolver's short stories. I really liked them, but I wasn't sure how a full-length book would be. And I have to say, the Poisonwood Bible is a fantastic novel. Kingsolver's writing flows and and is full of imagery and detail. It is set in the Congo, and follows the family of Nathan Price, a fanatical Baptist preacher. The story is told through the perspective of the four Price daughters and occasionally their mother. Kingsolver's ability to change her voice to match the personalities of her characters is incredible. My personal favorite Price is Adah, the damaged genius who plays with words and cynicism, but even the characters I disliked had interesting points to make. Definitely worth reading! :)"
100,The Poisonwood Bible,0060786507,Barbara Kingsolver,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,The Poisonwood Bible is a well written novel with an outstanding story line.  Barbara Kingsolver does a remarkable job of placing the reader in the middle of the jungle along with her characters and she includes enough history of the Congo to make the reader believe that this is almost a true story...even though it isn't! This book is definitely a great read for anyone looking for a great story!

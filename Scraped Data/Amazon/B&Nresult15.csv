1419,The Stand: Captain Trips,0785136207,"Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, Stephen King, Mike Perkins, Laura       Martin",Barnes and Noble,4.5,eleanor_eader on LibraryThing,"This volume tells King¿s story from the first escape of the Superflu to ¿ approximately ¿ the end of US civilisation, following those survivors who provide the linchpins of the novel¿s epic first chapters.  There are still a few scenes that I would have expected to be covered in volume 1 that it didn¿t quite reach, but otherwise, it¿s a great opening book.The first thing I noticed was how nice an edition it is; most of my graphic novel collection is soft-cover, so this had an classy, yet odd feel to it.  Odder yet, was how closely it followed The Stand in storyline, without digressions ¿ stripped to its bare bones, perhaps ¿ but exactly the story that King told (or the beginning of that story, anyway) in his novel.  There¿s something about knowing a story that well, but having it unspool in a different medium, that is tremendously unsettling, especially when the subject matter is so horrifyingly visual¿ it¿s a story that was made to be rendered in disgusting and exquisite panels of art.  My favourite impressions are of Flagg himself, and Frannie (whom the movie completely sold out), who is not as I imagined her in the novel either, and yet who comes alive in one perfect panel (her response to Jessie¿s `oh hell¿ moment).  Lloyd and Poke¿s crime spree could have filled its own volume, it was so vividly disgraceful.  Larry Underwood, too, feels completely right (as does the `you aint¿ no nice guy sequence¿) ¿ the others, not yet, but for me the film did them no injustices, so I didn¿t need new faces.In a way, I wish The Stand hadn¿t been one of my faithful re-reads, growing up¿ if I knew the story a little less well, I might get even more out of the straightforwardly extracted sections of text; as it is, it¿s delightful to see how well those pieces tell the beginning of the story on their own.  Not that I¿m suggesting my favourite writer is overly wordsome.The Dark Tower graphic novels wander all over the place, in comparison.  That¿s not necessarily a bad thing, but if all you want is a Stephen King story without the need to read 800+ pages and pretty pictures, there¿s nothing here to suggest this series isn¿t going to deliver it."
1419,The Stand: Captain Trips,0785136207,"Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, Stephen King, Mike Perkins, Laura       Martin",Barnes and Noble,4.5,ElizaJane on LibraryThing,"Reason for Reading: I re-read The Stand this year and heard about the comic adaptation, so of course wanted to check it out.This is a very faithful adaptation of King's The Stand and I enjoyed it immensely. This first book covers the whole superflu leak. The government part of the story is taken care of pretty quickly, giving us enough information and background to know what happened but care has been taken to include the significant small things such as the man whose face is in the tomato soup. We meet most of our heroes in this volume and what they were doing at the time the flue, nicknamed Captain Trips, hit. We only meet one member of the dark side in this volume. We are introduced gently to the dreams of the cornfield as a couple of people have the visions and Randall Flagg is introduced here as well. We are given his background, what he knows of it, and we are in no doubt that he is the evil force.I'm really pleased with how closely the story stayed to the book. Of course, things have been condensed. Whole situations have been summed up in a few scenes but the important plot points are there along with the small things that are important to character development. I really like how the characters have been portrayed as well. It's been a quick introduction in this volume so not all the characters have come into themselves yet, but so far I think Stu, Frannie and Randall have had the best characterization. All in all, well done. I'm really looking forward to continuing with the series but I'll take my time with it since it's only 4 volumes in so far."
1419,The Stand: Captain Trips,0785136207,"Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, Stephen King, Mike Perkins, Laura       Martin",Barnes and Noble,4.5,ursula on LibraryThing,"I decided to give this series a shot when I saw it at the library even though I hadn't been that thrilled with the graphic novel adaptations of The Gunslinger. These were done by different authors, and I do love this book more, so I figured it might be worth reading.I'm glad I picked it up - this was a detailed retelling of the story. This first volume only covers from the original leak of the superflu through meeting most of the main characters and seeing the people around them die. Intercut with their stories is our introduction to Randall Flagg. I'm really looking forward to reading the second volume."
1420,The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany,0671728687,William L. Shirer,Barnes and Noble,4.4,KBP,The Nook version of this great books IS NOT the 50th anniversary edition as pictured and advertised. It is the Rosetta Books version of a couple of years ago. It does not have the new forward by Ron Rosenbaum nor any of the other additional content.
1420,The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany,0671728687,William L. Shirer,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Azpooldude,"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, by William Shirer, is without question The, most informative, well written account of the years from Hitler's birth until the end of World War Two in May of 1945, that I have ever read. This is the ""Grand-Daddy"" of them all, a must read for those interested in learning about this unforgettable time is world history. First released in 1959, this book is still readily available, half a century later, in all major book stores. A massive book, my paperback copy is 1,596 pages,(some of this books chapter's would be the subject of whole books written by other authors)is a surprisingly very fast read. Many have commented that it was so interesting, they could not put it down. Others have said that they read it straight through-I can see why.
Starting from the birth of Adolph Hitler, until the end of the Third Reich, William Shirer shares his actual experiences during the years, 1934-1940, where he was an American correspondent for CBS News and was regarded as one of the most respected U.S. journalist in wartime Europe. We are treated to first hand accounts of life in the Nazis Germany by Mr. Shirer, who had the opportunity to meet with many of the Hitler's inner circle, to include Goering and Dr. Goebbels, attended the Nazis rallies in Nuremberg and was present during many important events. He also was the reporter to scoop the French surrender to the Nazis in 1940. Besides living in Europe, Mr. Shirer offers numerous footnotes, personal journal entries from Hitler's generals and actual testimonies from the Nuremberg War Trails in 1946, that add incredible historical facts to the book. Much of the material was captured by the Allies after the war and made available to archivist and researchers.
Of interest is how William Shirer managed to smuggle out his notes and papers, as he fled Nazi Germany during the hight of the war to return home to America, is a story in itself. In the book, the Nazis rise to power, and all its key players, the appeasement of Neville Chamberlain, and Hitler's lies to annex Czechoslovakia and other countries leading up to the beginning of the war are explained to the fullest.  How the United Stated got involved in the war and Hitler's use of Mussolini and Japan are quite astonishing. Everything about the war is covered, from Russia to the Baltic, to the war in the Atlantic to North Africa and how the fast moving German Army was finally slowed down and eventually stopped. Be warned that many of the Nazis atrocities are explained in detail to complete the full picture of this horrid nightmare in human history.
The later part of the book gives the final account of the Reich and how its lunatic dictator and his loyal followers, still thought that the war could be won. Unknown to many is that when the Nazis realized that the war was lost, they thought they could enter into a pact with the West to defeat the hated Russians, unaware that the Allies had already agreed amongst themselves that an unconditional surrender was the only way to end the war. The final days and collapse of the Third Reich, the death of Hitler and his henchmen, is well documented as well.
There is too much to comment on in a short review, but this book deserves a place on every bookshelf.  A shocking story, that needs to be told and retold over and over ,hence history should not repeat itself. The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is a true classic.

1420,The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany,0671728687,William L. Shirer,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Blackville,"I'm not a fast reader and I dove into the nearly 1,200-page tome with the understanding that I would probably devote the next month or two to the quest of gaining a much fuller understanding of Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany.  

I thought it would be worth the effort and I was right.  William Shirer's engrossing narrative provides a virtual ""everything you ever wanted to know"" about the Third Reich from the vantage point of someone who was actually there!  

A few reviewers have carped about his tendancy toward journalistic license at the expense of academic research, but I was able to overlook this in much the same way that I got past the same criticisms while reading Shelby Foote's wonderful three-volume account of The Civil War.  Dry historic research is okay for dry historic researchers.  

But, most popular writers are going to have some sort of bias, and Shirer can't avoid his need to remind us that frequently the Nazis were really BAD people and did really BAD things.  This I do not mind .. I appreciate it in fact."
1421,A Long Way Down,1594481938,Nick Hornby,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Guest,"Ok...I waited a long time for this book, and i was somewhat dissappointed. Don't get me wrong, Nick Hornby is a great author, i love all his other books, but this one wasn't what i thought it would be.It started out great but....it kind of lingered down at the end. Maybe my expectations were high when i was reading it, of course it had some pretty funny but dark moments, but i would not recommend this book for newcomers to Nick Hornby."
1421,A Long Way Down,1594481938,Nick Hornby,Barnes and Noble,3.5,hutchers,"I have seen Hornby's movies and have thoroughly enjoyed them so I thought I would try one of his Novels. Sadly, I was disappointed. I, at first, was entertained by the odd nature of the characters and the plot, but quickly became bored and annoyed with both. I think his attempts to be original were successful and his diction was easy to read but as the story itself progressed I began to resent the book. He may have achieved a well worded book, but the actual plot and story were unreliable and somewhat boring. 

There were positive parts to the book, Hornby's use of humor and allusions to pop culture helped move the book along and he easily portrayed selfish and flawed characters, but I was unable to find a connection, relate to or even like any of these characters. I was hoping for a meaningful ending, perhaps even an epiphany for the characters, but once again I found myself disappointed. For me, even though they may have suffered slight change the characters were stagnant. I saw little change in this novel and I think despite his efforts to create a realistic and relatable work, Hornby fell flat."
1421,A Long Way Down,1594481938,Nick Hornby,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Anonymous,I thought the book would be more riveting. Hoping the movie is better...
1422,"Out from Boneville (Bone, #1)",0439706408,"Jeff Smith, Steve Hamaker",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"First, a note to parents: many of you have been saying that there is material in this book that is not appropriate for children. In many interviews the author has addressed this say that while he did not write Bone for a children's audience (the comic books were originally released in black and white starting in the 90's) he says that the comics do not promote smoking and drinking. Neither Thorn or Phone Bone, the main characters partake in either activity. Plus none of the characters are seen getting drunk. I find it hard to believe that a child does not see people smoking on the sidewalk or people having a beer or glass of wine with their dinner. If it makes you more comfortable I would encourage you to read the stories with your child and explain to them that like in the comic, these activities are only for adults. Anyway, moving on.

REVIEW: 
Bone was the first graphic novel I ever read and I was floored. Expecting a light, funny story I found myself caught in what exploded into an epic fantasy. Well told, and though it is, like the author says, Tolkien crossed with Bugs Bunny, the story is very original. When the color editions came out I introduced them to my brother who was struggling with reading, and he was hooked. These graphic novels, comics, books, whatever you want to call them are definitely a great way to get kids to start reading, and are an intriguing adventure for readers of all ages."
1422,"Out from Boneville (Bone, #1)",0439706408,"Jeff Smith, Steve Hamaker",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Bolf,"What seems like a book for younger population in the first three books, gets a lot darker after book four. So don't mistake it for a children's book. It's filled with so much humor, mystery, losses and surprises it's unbelievable. Characters are incredibly lovable. I first read it in 2006, and it was my favorite comic book since then. It still feels the same reading it now as it did back then. Recommended to people of every age group."

1423,Rose Madder,0340640146,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"I read this book when it first came out and just loved it the first time. This book is something that you don't want to put it down. Years later and here I am reading this book again and still love it. If you like Stephen King books with some twisting stories to get your imagination going, then this is the book I would recommend."
1423,Rose Madder,0340640146,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,This book takes you to a different place as all Kings books do. While still having you rooted in a real womans issue with abuse and finding strength from within.
1423,Rose Madder,0340640146,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,I read this book many years ago and is the one book that has remained vividly in my memory.  Stephen King is my favorite author.  I wans't an avid reader until I ready one of his books then I was hooked.  Rose Madder is by far the best fictional book I have ever read.  Thats why he is the King.
1424,"Die Trying (Jack Reacher, #2)",0515142247,Lee Child,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,Die Trying was an incredible book. One of my favorite Lee Child books so far. I have read most of his books but I especially liked the theme that he used for this book. It starts out in typical Lee Child fashion when Jack Reacher finds himself swept into some kind of mischeif. In this book though the bad guys are a malitia group that want to turn the state of Montana into their own country. As always Lee Child adds lots of action and twists and turns. Who can he trust? One particularly tense part of the book involved crawling through a small tunnel in the middle of a mountain with a small flashlight that of course dies so that he is left in the dark and the tunnel narrows till he is stuck! Great book and I highly recommend it!!
1424,"Die Trying (Jack Reacher, #2)",0515142247,Lee Child,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"This was one book I really didn't want to put down. (and that's saying a great deal for me) Jack is the man!, the writing was thrilling, a movie for the mind. I'm going to pick up 'Tripwire' tomorrow"
1424,"Die Trying (Jack Reacher, #2)",0515142247,Lee Child,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Hiredoutlaw,"I started this book with little in mind. I had read Killing Floor a week prior to this and in my mind I had an idea of what the second novel would hold within. A light-read with a heavy romance between the main character and a broad he meets. Boy, was I wrong about this installment.  Mr. Child follows up with a story that takes some getting used to and understanding but soon enough you can't put it down.  You HAVE to know what will happen to Jack.Basically, the book starts off fast.  Reacher (the main character) is helping Holly, an FBI agent located in Chicago.  She hurt her leg and carrying her laundry out from the laundromat has proved more troublesome than ever.  Reacher lends a hand and shares the butt of a gun in his gut from a mysterious man who forces both of them into a car that speeds away from Chicago.  Reacher has just been the victim of the old proverb: ""wrong place at the wrong time.""  Only, Reacher soon realizes Holly is not just your ordinary FBI agent.The first 100 pages or so are very interesting. They speed by fast as you you need to know what happens.  Reacher causes an epic fight in the first 100 pages or so and you are locked in.  However, it starts to drag when the two of them are finally prisoners at a militia camp in Montana.  It got to a point where I was questioning myself. ""Should I stop?"" It wasn't leading anywhere and frankly, I was a tad bored.  I had other books on my mind.I decided to keep reading and I am glad I did. The book picks up and the last 100 pages are so thrilling and so suspenseful, you can't help but keep the book plastered in front of you.  It finally finishes in a ""bang"" and ends almost abruptly leaving you hungry for more.  The mysteries within the book are surprising however I was picking up on some clues in the beginning and analyzed them to conclude the mysteries and on some I was right and others wrong.  In a way, the end of the novel also leaves you a little shocked as the question ""Who is it?"" is finally answered.I'll be picking up Mr. Child's next installment soon.  Die Trying was an amazing sophomore attempt and is showing bright things for this author's future.  And judging from his large array of installments in this series currently, I'd say Mr. Child will be writing Reacher novels for a long time to come."
1425,"Beautiful Chaos (Caster Chronicles, #3)",0316123528,"Kami Garcia, Margaret Stohl, Paz Pruneda",Barnes and Noble,4.5,BubblesCO,I have all the other books on my Nook. I'd like to keep my series in the same format! PLEASE!!! I am actually re-reading the series to get ready for the new one. I love this series. There is always something going on and it's never boring. If you love the supernatural and love stories make sure to read this series!
1425,"Beautiful Chaos (Caster Chronicles, #3)",0316123528,"Kami Garcia, Margaret Stohl, Paz Pruneda",Barnes and Noble,4.5,BooksWithBite,"I admit that this book completely took me by surprise. As the reader, I was expecting so many others things but never that. I loved that this book took a whole new spin on love and sacrifice!

What I loved most about this book is the great plot line. So much going on in the book that is kept the reader hooked and always sated. Never once did my eyes stray from the pages as I devoured it. I enjoyed that while the plot line is unraveling secrets, poems, and love popped up where I never saw it.  Both authors once again did an amazing job on capturing the essence of the town and the characters!

The characters development in the story is where it needs to be. So much had changed in them that you know that these characters are at their peak. I enjoyed reading along with the characters in discovering secrets that have been under their noses. The book title is great for whats goes on in the book. Chaos. Total Chaos!

Now for the ending. Did I see that coming? No. It was something that left me gasping and WOWed. I won't spoil it, but yeah. Amazing ending that left me wanting more.

Beautiful Chaos is a completion of wonderful literature that had me in awe! I felt like I was in the town of Gatlin as soon as I open the first page, fighting the chaotic events unfolding between the pages. Filled with a great adventure of love and sacrifice, Beautiful Chaos will undo your mind leaving you yearning for more of Gatlin."
1425,"Beautiful Chaos (Caster Chronicles, #3)",0316123528,"Kami Garcia, Margaret Stohl, Paz Pruneda",Barnes and Noble,4.5,EmoKitty,"Beautiful Chaos is a book mixed with love, suspense, and sacrifice. It is the third book in the Caster Chronicles. In my opinion, Beautiful Chaos is better than the first and second- Beautiful Creatures and Beautiful Darkness- combined. Yes, the first two were very good, but Beautiful Chaos has more drama. Instead of focusing on Lena¿s problems, it focuses on Ethan¿s. Since Ethan is the narrator, you can really get inside his mind and actually feel what he feels.
In the third installment of the Caster Chronicles, both worlds - the Caster and Mortal- go bad. Lena¿s Claiming- both Dark and Light- has messed up the Order of Things. Ethan is losing more of himself every day; Amma is acting Dark; and Ridley is suddenly casting spells again, yet she is Mortal. Throughout the novel, Amma is very secretive and we realize that she knows what the Wheel of Fate wants to be able to fix The Order: a sacrifice of The One Who is Two.This book kept me reading chapter after chapter. I never glanced up from it. The drama and suspense all comes together in the biggest and greatest finale I¿ve ever read. The ending definitely shocked me. And, I¿ll admit, I cried while reading the last chapter. It was a huge cliffhanger, and it makes the reader wanting to know the release of the next, and final, book.
	What I loved about this book is that Lena and Ethan know that life is short now; every moment could be their last. Ethan is so sweet to Lena; it made me teary-eyed reading what he says about her: ¿That when she looked at me, it was like there was no one else in the world. That when I looked at her, I noticed every detail about her while everything else faded away. That I was only myself when we were together.¿
I was overall satisfied with this book; never mind the heartbreaking, jaw dropping, tear jerking, ending. I still can¿t believe what Stohl and Garcia did to all the readers; it was like a kick in the throat. However, the purpose was achieved: I want to keep reading and I need to know if everything turns out happy."
1426,Keeping Faith,0060878061,Jodi Picoult,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"Controversial topics in life are typically the following:  religion, divorce, and even the media, so why is it that Jodi Picoult can take those subjects and write a novel that captures your heart?  Basically, she takes the innocence of a child and uses it to portray it in a way that you can't complain about.  Keeping Faith will have you wondering about things you never would believe could happen, such as stigmata and a resurrection.

Faith, by definition, is belief in, devotion to, or trust in somebody or something, especially without logical proof.  Faith, in this story, is a young girl striving for her mother's attention while her parents are in the middle of a messy custody battle.  The crazy thing is, while this is going on, Faith starts to see God, and even take on occurrences that happened to the Messiah; she didn't even know who God was until this moment.  Media hears about this miraculous little girl and creates frenzy and chaos that her and her family has very little patience to endure.  A custody battle, along with the media frenzy, will cause unsuspecting characters to find love, and for the hopes of a young girl to hopefully be fulfilled; she wants the ones she loves to have unrelenting faith in her.

Jodi Picoult, in this novel, as well as her others, uses techniques that allow you to draw your own conclusion, and keeps you reading page after page until you are exhausted from sleep deprivation.  She is also able to take several points of views, and make them your own thoughts, and really get you into character.  I believe in her doing this, she really captured the essence of the book.  Each main character, Faith, Mariah (Faith's mother), and Ian (televised Atheist), have their own story, and each has relevance to the outcome of the story.   Faith, obviously has the most impact on the outcome, a young girl, fighting for attention, suddenly can perform miracles, and is totally oblivious to her doings.  Mariah, once suicidal, is in the middle of protecting her daughter from the media, winning the custody battle, and winning the battle of learning to have faith and to trust.  Ian is a character that will definitely strike your interest as his story unfolds, his of a child hood you never would have imagined, and his own battle of learning to open up again.  
Although I don't enjoy doing it myself, I loved the fact that Picoult researched every nook and cranny in the book; she made sure that it was as realistic as possible.  The court scene, for example, gave me chills, and made me feel as though I was one of the lucky people aloud to observe the trial.  I could feel the hurt, the anger, and the deceit in every word and action made. 
 
In a nut shell, I would definitely recommend this book to everyone out there, young or old, male or female with any religious background, but especially to mothers and daughters; read this together and I can guarantee that your relationship will only grow stronger.  While I'm at it, I will also recommend one of Jodi Picoult's other moving novels, Change of Heart, especially if you love the controversial topics discussed in this book."
1426,Keeping Faith,0060878061,Jodi Picoult,Barnes and Noble,4,hannahprescott,"Mariah White and her seven year old daughter, Faith, return home early one afternoon to find Mariah's husband in the bedroom with another woman. Mariah White, for the second time in their marriage, catches her husband with another woman, (first time she tried to commit suicide). Mariah once again goes into depression and Faith has an imaginary friend. Faith begins quoting the bible and is able to heal people. This brings proclaimed atheist and anti-televangelist, Ian Fletcher, into the mix, determined to discredit Faith and her supposed conversations with God. . Mariah tries to shield her daughter from the attention while trying to find out what is wrong with her. This one, as all of Jodi's books, grabs the heart with both hands."
1426,Keeping Faith,0060878061,Jodi Picoult,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"I began this book not knowing what to expect: I hadn't read previous reviews, and I did not read the back cover before I opened it up.  I was intrigued by the title and the cover art alone.  As I read through it on SuperBowl Sunday, I was touched by the events that mark the milestones of Faith, Millie, Mariah and Ian.  Each character was clearly defined, cleverly etched and leapt off the pages into my heart.  The bickering between religions, the unflagging support of mother to child, and the honesty with which the author wrote the parent-child conversations touched me to the core.  Of particular interest is in the climactic hospital scenes when Mariah's internal diaglogue exposes what every parent prays when their little ones are hurting.  A real gem!"

It is a wonderful way for him to learn about adolescent life.  The Wimpy Kid series also gives him something talk about with other kids because everyone we know is reading this series.  Jeff Kinney doesn't pull any punches in trying to make his main character some heroic angel. The reason all of this is so important to us is because our son has autism.

Countless times I was astroprojected into the characters of the story, predominately Kyler and Durzo. The emotional oscillation with Elene and Vi was impeccable. Other than the fact that I couldn't be provided -even at the end when it was supposed to- the official unification of Kyler and Vi, the plot throughout the whole trilogy was brilliant. I just don't feel as though the gripping of the hands at the very end was enough. I wanted Kyler and Vi together sooner, or at least confirmation of their unity 'laughs' but all together. Fantastic story"

Lewis and ""The Chronicles of Narnia"", I can honestly say that the Night Angel Trilogy touched and inspired me in a way that I haven't known since Lewis.  It is an awesome and satisfying finale to a superbly written story.  When I finished ""Beyond the Shadows"" I sat silently for some time in order to digest and recover.  It was incredibly unique, groundbreaking and that heart-stopping.  I cannot express through words how highly I regard this piece of work.  Thanks Brent."

The only reason I picked up the audio recording is because Eliza Dushku was narrating.  She does an all right job with a role she is not made for.

1430,Everyone Worth Knowing,1416543007,Lauren Weisberger,Barnes and Noble,3.9,NativeRoses on LibraryThing,"This is a fun, silly book about Bette Robinson, a young woman who walks away from her grind of an analyst job at a major nyc investment bank.  She slacks and hangs out for awhile, before she scores another job in PR and enters the sleek world of all-night parties, fame, power, tastemakers, debuttantes, and celebrity babysitting.  Like all the other books in this genre, Bette ignores her better balanced friends and family, to pursue her whirl of a job and claw her way up the social ladder.Naturally, an epiphany follows.  And so forth . . . The plot is dull as mud.  What makes the book fun to read is the insider's view of the decadence of this social milieu as well as the view into the psyches of the individuals caught up in this world."

1431,"Redwall (Redwall, #1)",1862301387,Brian Jacques,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Cougar_H,"""Imagine a timeless world where any young reader could travel to whenever they wished. A place which exists beneath some blue forgotten sky. A land that does not have to rely on modern-day technology..."" this is a quote from Brian Jacques, on the topic of his book,""Redwall"". This is a definite must-read adventure story for young readers. It is about a young clumsy mouse named Matthias, who over the course of the story learns to conquer his fears. The thing that made this book so much more enjoyable was the author's way of personifying all of the many types of animals included in the book. The main plot of the story is that a group of evil rats commanded by Cluny, their terrible leader is trying to take over Redwall Abbey, the grand home of many peaceful creatures. Some of the characters include: Methuselah, a wise old scholar that helps Matthias throughout the story; Basil Stag Hare, a quite strange rabbit that gives the readers a good laugh; Constance, a giant badger that protects Redwall; and Martin, a warrior that helped establish Redwall and is also Matthias's idol. Brian Jacques is a very good writer; every detail of this book just flows together smoothly.

 While I was reading this book it almost always had me guessing what was going to happen next, and it usually is not what you expect will happen. Also, if you ever get bored at any time while you're reading, the author throws in a few hilarious comments every now and then. When I was in a bad mood right before I was going to sleep, I would just pick up this book and immerse myself into this wondrous fantasy story. Young readers can really connect to the characters thoughts and feeling, even though there supposed to be various animals, it is like they are children and adults from different aspects of every day life.  


 I have had this book for awhile but I never really got into it, I was running out of books to read so I thought I would try out this one again. It was a little boring for me at the very start of the story, but after I got past that I just could not put it down, with its: unique characters, marvelous settings, plot twists, and its adventurous feeling. To the people who enjoyed Redwall I would recommend reading through the rest of the books in the Redwall Series. I hope you enjoyed the book."
1431,"Redwall (Redwall, #1)",1862301387,Brian Jacques,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Guest,"Imagine if you were watching the conquest of an evil rat warlord, named Cluny, who was attacking a castle. That¿s what happened in Redwall a great novel by Brian Jacques one of his first pieces of published literature. Redwall started the first of the Redwall Series.  This story takes place in Mossflower wood which is right next to Redwall the abbey. Here the unlikely hero, Matthias, takes shelter, but all is not right in Mossflower because Cluny is coming to take Redwall. Matthias is a little mouse that is unraveling a web of riddles that will lead him to the sword of Martin, who is the dead warrior of Redwall.    Redwall is a great read for young-adults to adults. This story is an awesome war story. This book is a great way to build vocabulary and a good book for people who liked the Harry Potter series. The Redwall Series is a series that I recommend for people who want to get into something new that is adventurous."

Many people still debate about how ""communism"" has been practiced in the world and how it has had devastating effects on socity. Communism, in fact, has yet to be practiced. By reading this text, you will be able to clearly understand what Marx had in mind, and you will be able to discuss his political theory with an education and understanding. Don't let your opinions on communism be formed by what the skeptics say! This work, including others of Marx, illustrate what his ideas are and one will see that the ""communism"" that has been put into practice doesn't resemble his ideals at all!"

As a teenager, I know that kids today are raised with ""communism is evil, capitalism is good, and that's that"" without being explained to what exactly they are, and why one is considered bad, and the other good. this book is sometimes kinda boring at parts and hard to understand, mostly due to the vocabulary, but other times is wonderful, enlightening, and makes you upset about current society. you'll find yourself thinking, hmm communism is a good idea! i suggest this book to everybody frustrated with capitalism. WORKINGMEN OF ALL NATIONS, UNITE!"
1432,The Communist Manifesto,0140447571,"Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Gareth Stedman Jones",Barnes and Noble,3.5,Anonymous,"The Communist Manifesto is probably the most misinterpreted and misused book in history, (probably second to the Bible). Though it may need few revisions to be applicable to the 21st Century global economy, the core message remains universal and timeless. Marx says that if globalisation is inevitable, workers must rise up to see to it that it serves for the best interests of all humanity. Though he wanted socialism to be established as a phase in fully industialised countries, history had other plans leading to the 1917 revolution in the backward feudal Russian Empire. Manay praise this book, a few curse it, but no one can ignore it. Simply, timeless."

1434,The Last of the Mohicans (The Leatherstocking Tales #2),0553213296,James Fenimore Cooper,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"The Last of the Mohicans was an interesting and very detailed portrayal of a small group in the middle of the French and Indian War. I liked it a lot and would like to read more of James Fenimore Cooper¿s novels sometime. I know that many people enjoyed the movie, but to get the whole picture, you really need to read the book. The movie is great, I agree, but I just liked to book better (then again, when is it that you ever like a movie more than the book?). Though not my favourite classic, it is still an amazing book, very worthy of anyone¿s reading time."
1434,The Last of the Mohicans (The Leatherstocking Tales #2),0553213296,James Fenimore Cooper,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"James Fenimore Cooper's novel, The last of the Mohincans, tells the story of the colonial scout Hawkeye, real name Natty Bumppo, with his 2 Indian companions Changachgook (his Mohican father) and his mohican brother Uncas.  They stumble onto a party of British soldiers conducting 2 fair maidens (names Alice and Cora) traveling to their father Colonel Munro, who is the commander of the British Fort William Henry during the French and Indian War.  They are being treacherously lead by a huron scout Magua who intends to hurt the 2 girls in order to get to their father the Colonel. I thought that The Last of the Mohicans was a very interesting piece of work.    The book has a compelling story and great characters.  Any one that is interested in historical fiction should read this book.  The aouther tells this story in chronological order and in third person.  He was very descriptive and precise in writing this novel.  It is filled with action and adventure.  It has a heart felt story with a sad, but meaningful conclusion that is poignant and well thought out.  It gives you a sence of guilt to anyone that is from a British/ French heritage.  It makes you realize what is the real goal of English or French society,  putting risk on lives and ancient cultural heritage of the Native American people?  Or have a few extra acres of land?  I think that anyone who loves reading and have a plot that makes their mind work a little, would have the privelege of reading this book."

We don't have to make decisions like she did.
1435,Sophie's Choice,0679736379,William Styron,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"This story was highly recommended to me and so, without hesitation, I picked it up one day at a bookstore. It is definitely different from and Holocaust survivor story I have ever read/heard before. The main character of the story is necessarily where the interest of the story lies. I found him to be neither lovable nor unlovable, but more of a vehicle to uncovering the real story behind Sophie's life and past experiences. In a way, the lifestyle that Sophie chooses for herself post-war reminds me of something taken right out of an F. Scott Fitzgerald novel. Slowly but surely her mystery is finally uncovered, and the main character gets a shocking revelation as to the horror that Sophie went through, in some ways almost worse than the illness and death suffered among other victims."

This book is over 600 pages and there are pages and pages where the narrator of the story just talks and talks and talks! He goes out of his way to use the biggest word to describe the simpliest thing. I could not get to the meat of the story quick enough, as it was trapped within pages and pages of literary excess. Incredibly overcomplicated!"

1437,The Iron Daughter,0373210132,Julie Kagawa,Barnes and Noble,4.5,katarinasmama,"See I have a thing about sequel's -- they either hit the mark or they don't. There's no in-between point, at least not for me.

And I loved &lt;i&gt;The Iron King's&lt;/i&gt; mythology, charcters and plot, so I did have to wonder could Julie Kagawa do that all over again? Well,YA Fantasy Fans, she did even more!

What I loved about &lt;i&gt;The Iron King&lt;/i&gt; was the mythology -- the nod to traditional faerie lore and then the completely justified and believable addition of an Iron Court. This tilted the familiar power struggle between the Seelie and the Unseelie Courts and created complete chaos. It was exhilirating to read through it. But now what?

Well, Julie answered that question. She answered it in spades. When we last left Meaghan and Ash they were on their way to Ash's home, The Winter Court. Not exactly the turf that a Summer Court Princess (albeit half-human, half-fey) would feel comfortable in but Meaghan had made a promise to Ash and to the fey, promises are everything.

I'm going to keep this review spoiler-free, so let me just say that the book may start off with the fulfillment of a promise but where it leads you is so unbelievably unexpected that you will be gasping out loud. I've read a few books like this, so chock full of action that you find it exhilirating to turn the pages only to discover that there's even more. Isn't that the best part? I'm going to take a moment and compare Julie's action writing sequences to those of my favorite YA fantasy author, Cassandra Clare. Yes, they are THAT good. That unbelievably good.

But that's not the best part. The very best part were the characters' arcs -- Meaghan's, Ash's and Puck's. Their back-stories, journeys and amazing transformations were so credible that I found my heart aching for them.

And please, don't even ask if there's romance. There is unbelievable, forbidden, beautiful romance. Again, my hat's off to Julie, who wrote the scene on page 99 so well, that I had to text a few of my close bookwormish pals just to vent. What did the text say, you ask? It said, ""He's breaking my heart, but in a good way.""

A full five-stars to Julie Kagawa's The Iron Daughter. If you love action, romance and watching how characters mature through heart-wrenching trials, you will love this story as much as I do."
1437,The Iron Daughter,0373210132,Julie Kagawa,Barnes and Noble,4.5,ACasualReader,"I've honestly been putting off this review for a couple days for fear I won't do this review justice considering how much I loved it.  The story picks up right where it left off in The Iron King.  Meghan is taken by Ash to the Winter Court to face Queen Mab per the contract she made with him in return for his in help getting Ethan, her brother back.  I really can't say much about how the story unfolds, afraid I will give away something important. Julie Kagawa excels in creating a wonderful landscape. You're lost in this world and I found myself devouring the pages and losing track of time as I took on this journey with Meghan, Ash and Puck.
The love triangle continues in this story though I have to say, it's a little one sided. Meghan loves Puck but she loves Ash differently. When I was reading The Iron King, I was a little leery of Ash and Meghan's feelings toward one another and was waiting for Meghan to wake up and smell the roses with how Puck felt about her. The girl was pretty naive.  I was ready for Puck to get his chance. I can defiantly say I'm 100% team.Ash!  I love his character. You learn more about his past and some of his walls come down and you get to see the real Ash.
Puck is still Puck.witty and always cracking a joke or spitting out a smart comment. Though when it's time to get serious and protect Meghan, he's there 100% loyal all the way.
We get to see new characters and I'm and totally in love with Grim the cat. He is one of my favorite characters in the series.
I was shocked with the ending; I didn't actually think Ash would do what he did. It was bitter sweet and perfect and will have you aching to read Book 3, The Iron Queen. It comes out Feb 2011.
I highly recommend reading this book if you've already read The Iron King. I loved and strongly encourage everyone to read this series."
1437,The Iron Daughter,0373210132,Julie Kagawa,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Aik,"I had high expectations for this book even before I started reading it due to its brilliant debut. I wasn't the least bit disappointed with The Iron Daughter. It was as good as The Iron King, if not better. They story has a powerful and thrilling plot which brings readers on a journey to retrieve the Scepter of Seasons which was stolen by a new kind of Faery called The Iron Fey.

The beginning of the story started with Meghan staying in Tir Na Nog, the Winter Court, where Queen Mab is the monarch. She feels bad because of the incessant chill, but she feels even worse by Prince Ash's sudden change of behaviour --- he becomes distant, cold and cruel.

    His eyes glittered as he shot me a glare of pure loathing. ""It's Master Ash, or Your Highness to you, half-breed. And I don't recall giving you permission to speak to me. Remember that, because the next time you forget your place, I'll remind you with my blade."" --- Ash, page 28


Meghan can't go home, and her father, King Oberon has no way to free her because she is there on a contract of her own free will. When some Iron Fey lead by Tertius steals the Scepter of Seasons and murders the crown prince of the Winter Court, Sage, Queen Mab is furious and she accuses Oberon of doing the act of crime. A war is about to start... and Meghan is going to do anything to stop it from happening.

I love Julie's hauntingly beautiful description of the scenery of Faeryland. She manages to create a place where beauty and danger coexists. Julie's exquisite literary prose is one of the reasons which makes this book stand out from the sea of other novels in the fantasy genre. Her words made me delve into the Fey world with ease, following Meghan and her friends on their exciting and dangerous adventure.

In this novel, Meghan turns to Puck for company due to Ash's absence and cold demeanor. She finds that she actually has some feelings for Puck as well, but not as intense as the love she had for Ash. On the contrary, Puck is the one who pours out all his love and attention on his Princess, always there to support Meghan whenever she needs him, ever so protective of her.

    ""You're kind of blind, you know?"" Puck whispered, smiling to soften his words. ""I wouldn't defy Oberon for just anyone. But, for you..."" He leaned forward, touching his forehead to mine. ""I'd come back from the dead for you."" --- Puck, pg 123


The story is divided into 3 parts. The one who stole the scepter was revealed in the end of Part 2, but there is no further information about the new (and fake) Iron King. How will the love triangle between Puck, Meghan and Ash ends? When the time comes, who will Meghan choose? Is it the mischievous, caring and reliable Puck, or the cold, quiet and passionate Ash?

In the nutshell, The Iron Daughter is awesome! I can proudly announce that I'm now a great fan of Julie Kagawa. You should never miss The Iron Fey Series! I really can't wait to read the third book! *Beams with delight!*"

My only critique is the ending. I was left wanting a more concrete answer, but as the good books often do, I found myself having to guess at what the future for these characters would hold."

1440,Have a Little Faith: a True Story,0786868724,Mitch Albom,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"HAVE A LITTLE FAITH is REALLY a good read. Beyond the story and the characters (which in true Albom style, jump off of the page and into your heart), the message is deep. It's a book that will stay with you for quite awhile. I highlighted parts and dog-eared pages. In a nutshell, Albom profiles two people: a rabbi who he has been asked to write a eulogy for, and an inner-city convict turned pastor. Two very different worlds, two very different religions, but one strongly shared similarity: faith. The change we see in one of the main characters in the book is something that we rarely see in this world. We only hear about the bad things in the media, but there are people that change their life everyday and this book is a testament to that change. Another book I read last week that I really think you should check out because it's a great fit for Albom fans: EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE 2.0. That book has done wonderful things for me personally."

1441,My Life in France,1400043468,"Julia Child, Alex Prud'Homme",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"This is a darling book!  The sweetness and humility with   which the amazing Julia describes her intense and   fascinating way of going after the knowledge of French   cooking contains lessons for everybody-and not just   about cooking.  The loving descriptions of the French   sights, food and people had my soul yearning to see them   first hand.  I love this book.  I'm buying copies of this for my food   loving relatives.  I plan to read this book again and again   and wish my life could have half the joy and purpose with   which Julia lived hers."
1441,My Life in France,1400043468,"Julia Child, Alex Prud'Homme",Barnes and Noble,4.2,20MAKAYLA11,"This beautifully written and completely charming memoir captures Julia's unique and genuine personality. This is one of the most delightful, happy books I've ever read! Julia admits complete ignorance at the beginning of her story, which attests to her most unusual gift for blending self-deprecation with charming self-confidence, and it is her natural curiosity that led her to collaborate with master chefs, true to her non-condescending and bubbly personality. There is a heavenly breathless spirit about this book that captures her earthiness and integrity and complete emotional fulfillment that is absolutely contagious. This is the most beautiful love story between kindred spirits. Her husband, Paul, who clearly shines throughout, worked for the US State Department, and it was he who encouraged Julia's exploration and interest in fine cuisine and his transfer to Paris began her legacy. What a wonderful marriage they must have had! They shared an extraordinary life of love and passion, not only for each other but for travel and the tastes to explore other cultures. Her colorful and bright and cheery account of her 1940's life-changing stay in France is one of the most cherished, enjoyable and interesting books I've had the pleasure of reading. I wanted to sing. This book is a great biography, as well as a historical account of a nation, as instruction of the refined culinary arts, and it works well as the travelogue that evokes the locations being described. My senses were titillated; I could smell the baking bread, lavender fields, leg of lamb cooking in sumptuous herbs; I could taste the magnificent, succulent dishes; I could see the lush countryside, the cobblestone roads and streets. The laughter, the wit, the union, their lives together had to be Heaven on earth. This is beautifully told, brimming with life, just as Julie Child lived during her years in France, and as compelling as a great novel that you know has a happy ending. Because the family kept all of Paul and Julia's letters home, primarily Paul's twin brother, Charlie and his wife, the detail is as fresh and fun as when it first happened. Julia oozed ""joie de vivre"", loved a new adventure and took life on with an incredibly open mind. She seized opportunity with great zest and had the confidence that she could achieve her goal. She was real and fun and didn't take things too seriously. One of Julia Child's most compelling attributes was her ability to share her knowledge without being intimidating. She gave you the sense that she was as accessible and as friendly as if she'd known you all her life, although infinitely more interesting. She truly cared about people, all people. With class, charm, enormous magnetism, and great determination this remarkable woman had turned French cooking into an American fascination. This is not a book about food; this is a book about life, full of passion and love and wisdom, beauty, art and creation. You can learn a lot from a life like that. This should be on everyone's reading list."
1441,My Life in France,1400043468,"Julia Child, Alex Prud'Homme",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,We all have a version of Julia Child in our head and it is likely one that stems from fondness. This book only makes you love her more. She has such a joie de vivre as she finds herself and creates a beautiful life with a wonderful husband and very charming and interesting family and friends. She's also honest about the things that may not have gone so well. But you always get the feeling that Ms. Child looked at all her experiences - good and bad - as part of a remarkable journey and that she loved the people who accompanied her along the way.

I hope that with the birth of BUD/HUDSON, we will be able to see some softer sides from both the Rosie and Don characters in the future.  Their ridgid cold science personalities are thawing a bit which makes them more personable, but yet keeps the reader interested as to how these personalities try to take average every day life and analyze, track and formalize their data into some thing the average Joe on the street will laugh at.  With all that said, I finished the book with a smile."

I loved The Rosie Project and recommended it to several people. Those who read it also loved it. I was thrilled to find out there was a sequel, although I didn&rsquo;t think one was necessary. It was a great stand alone book.




Having said that, I am so glad I got to read The Rosie Effect. It is another great book and I enjoyed seeing Don and Rose as their relationship progressed. However, it is not as light a book as the first. Rose has gotten pregnant on purpose without discussing it with Don. She is dealing with her own emotional problems which are exacerbated by pregnancy hormones. Mostly, she is terrified that Don won&rsquo;t be able to emotionally connect with the baby.




Don tries to manage as he has always done . . . by learning as much about pregnancy and small children as he can. This leads to numerous problems involving giving nutritional advice to Rose (not well received), encounters with the law, and court ordered therapy. Since Don knows from his research that Rose should not be stressed, he hides the last two from her.




Actually, I think he would have been safer to have withheld the nutritional advice and told her about his run in with the law.




In a way, this book was heartbreaking. Don tries so hard. He loves Rose and does everything he is capable of doing to keep her happy. It just doesn&rsquo;t work.




This statement from Don which comes near the end of the book explains so much about his difficulties dealing with others.




&ldquo;I was suddenly angry. I wanted to shake not just Lydia but the whole world of people who do not understand the difference between control of emotion and lack of it, and who make a totally illogical connection between inability to read others&rsquo; emotions and inability to experience their own.&rdquo;




Make no mistake. The Rosie Effect is a great book. It&rsquo;s just not as lighthearted as The Rosie Project. Read it. You won't regret it."

1444,Ham on Rye,006117758X,Charles Bukowski,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"HAM ON RYE is one of my all-time favorite novels. In all of Bukowski's work there is a constant search for truth and freedom. With every breath that Bukowski takes he is locked in a fevered struggle with the forces around him that contiually attempt to make him walk the path of the common man. His writing has been likened to that of McCrae (think, his KATZENJAMMER) and for a good reason:  both men have a knack for keen observation, wit, and writing style that knocks you over. But Bukowski sees this ¿common man path¿ as nothing more than falling into a lock step towards certain death. Though he portrays himself as a repulsive type of human being, he is able to convince us that it is the world around him that is far more repulsive. In Ham On Rye, we are lead through the more meaningful chapters of Bukowski's childhood and early adulthood. There are very few pieces of literature that reaches readers with more honesty. I plow through Bukowski like I do Cap'n'Crunch. The man inspires drunken poetry on hot summer nights- while talking about women, booze, masturbation, classical music, & horse racing. This book is my new favorite. Why? Because while facinating the reader with lurid tales of a painful and depressing childhood, Bukowski makes us laugh, cry, and feel sorry for that kid we made fun of in 7th grade. If you liked POST OFFICE or McCrae¿s KATZENJAMMER, then you¿ll love HAM ON RYE as well. All are great, and this novel is the best place to start if you¿re new to the BUKOWSKI canon of literature."

1446,Emotional Intelligence 2.0,0974320625,"Travis Bradberry, Jean Greaves, Patrick Lencioni",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"I read the authors' first emotional intelligence book, and I think that 2.0 is a huge improvement. Here's a chapter by chapter look at why:

FOREWORD BY PATRICK LENCIONI
Lencioni is one of those gurus that has sold millions of books, none about emotional intelligence (EQ). As Lencioni proclaims in the foreword, he's no EQ expert, but he sees everyday how critical a skill it is to have and he's so enthusiastic about this book because it's the first he's read that actually shows you how to increase your EQ and apply it in your life.

THE JOURNEY
This chapter opens with a riveting story of a surfer who is attacked by a great white shark in California. I won't spoil it by telling you how, but the story is a great illustration of the power of emotion and how important it is to understand and manage our emotions. This chapter also illustrates how our brains are wired to react to events emotionally before our reason kicks in, and it lays the groundwork for the process by which the rest of the book will teach you to increase your EQ.

THE BIG PICTURE
This chapter teaches what EQ is and what it isn't. For example, a lot of people mistakenly think that EQ is a part of your personality. To the contrary EQ is separate from your personality, just as it is separate from your intellect, or IQ. It begins to build your understanding of emotions by showing what the five core emotions look like in varying degrees of intensity. Next the authors fun and engaging approach explains studies that illustrate how important EQ is in daily living. They show how your EQ impacts things like your tolerance for change, how you manage stress, even how much money you make!

-DIGGING IN: MY EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE ACTION PLAN-
If you haven't already, by this point in the book you need to open the orange envelope inside the back cover and retrieve the unique passcode that lets you go online to take the Emotional Intelligence Appraisal test. I'd actually heard of this test (it's the most widely used EQ test out there), so I thought it was pretty cool that they let you take it for free with the book. In addition to revealing your EQ scores, your test results guide you through the areas you need to work on improving the most. This chapter helps you to develop your plan of attack, including the action plan where you actually record what it is your going to do and by when.

-SELF-MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES-
(ACTUALLY THERE IS A CHAPTER OF STRATEGIES FOR EACH SKILL, BUT I'LL JUST DESCRIBE THIS ONE)
This section of the book has 66 strategies to increase your EQ. Each strategy is well-detailed (most 2-3 pages) and something that you can begin doing immediately. Your test results tell you which EQ skill you need to work on the most (for me it was Self-management), as well as which of the chapter's strategies will increase your ability in that skill the most. I thought this part was pretty cool. Basically, the test analyzed my score profile and picked the three strategies that would improve my biggest weaknesses in self-management. One of the strategies it suggested, Breathe Right, hit the nail on the head. I'm not one of these people that needs to take a deep breath to calm down and stop being angry, which is good because that's NOT what the strategy is teaching. Actually, it illustrates how some of us, when left to our own devices, breathe too shallow, which deprives some of the higher (rational) areas of the brain of the oxygen needed to keep us completely calm and focused. So now, whenever I need to clear my head, think on my feet at work, make a tough decision, figure out what I should get my wife for her birthday, etc. I use this breathing strategy, and I'm continually amazed by how quickly it makes me calm and focused. Anyway, that's just one self-management strategy, but I thought it'd be useful for you to see what one is like in detail.

-EPILOGUE--JUST THE FACTS: A LOOK AT THE LATEST DISCOVERIES IN EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE-
This epilogue is quite interesting. The authors' company is a think tank that has tested more than half a million people worldwide, and they share some of the more interesting conclusions from their data that didn't show up earlier in the book. For example, women outscore men in overall EQ, but the sexes have an equal ability in self-awareness (men fall short because they do less with the emotional information they take in). Anyhow, there are studies of EQ differences across various generations (Boomers vs. Millenials is really interesting), in different job titles (CEO's have the lowest EQ in the workforce!), and even US vs. China (our new, big economic competitor).

-DISCUSSION QUESTIONS FOR READING GROUPS-
This last appendix has some great questions for discussion. I'm not in a book club, but my wife read the book and we talked about some of these questions and it led to some really interesting discussions."
1446,Emotional Intelligence 2.0,0974320625,"Travis Bradberry, Jean Greaves, Patrick Lencioni",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Oscar_Aguilar,"I was given this book as prework for a leadership retreat at my company. They make us read a lot of books this way, and I usually skim them or don't read them at all because I can't get into them. Emotional Intelligence 2.0 broke the mold.

I read it cover to cover twice before the retreat, and I was soaking up good info like a sponge both times. The book makes a strong case for why emotional intelligence is important on the job, and uses data from inside real organizations to show how EQ impacts job performance and company performance.

The beauty of the strategies (there are a TON of them) in the book is they are the kind of things you can weave into your daily routine without thinking too hard about it. I review the strategies section each morning before I head to work, and find myself applying what I read all day long.

The book also includes access to an online test which is incredible. I admit that some of the stuff my results revealed weren't super easy to fess up to, but I think that's the point. The results made me feel like I was watching myself on a movie screen or something where I could see so clearly how I come across to other people. Anyway, it's a nice addition to the book, and I wish more books were like it."

1447,Make Way for Ducklings,0670035386,Robert McCloskey,Barnes and Noble,4.4,FeatheredQuillBookReviews,"We don't normally review books that were published so long ago, but I've ""re-fallen"" (is that a word?) in love with this book and I wanted to share with our readers. I was in Boston recently and, while browsing in the ""Bostonian Society Museum Shop,"" found (or more aptly, re-discovered) Make Way for Ducklings by Robert McCloskey. I LOVE this book. Make Way for Ducklings was originally published in 1941 and is about the ducks living on the Boston Common. Mr. and Mrs. Mallard are looking for a place to live but they just can't seem to find the right spot. Finally, after much searching, they discover the perfect new home - a tiny little island, surrounded by a lovely pond, in the middle of the Boston Public Garden (a.k.a. Boston Common). The ducks love their new home and start thinking of raising a family there. But just then, a boy on his bike, vroom, vroom, comes squealing through the ducks. ""We'll have to look somewhere else,"" suggests Mrs. Mallard. The ducks eventually find a quite spot next to the Charles River. They build a nest and hatch out eight wonderful ducklings. Life is grand for the new duck family. One day Mr. Mallard decides to go exploring and tells Mrs. Mallard that they should meet in a week at the Public Garden. Unfortunately, little ducklings can't fly. So in a week, they set off - right through the city of Boston! - to get to the Public Garden. Watch out! Baby ducklings on the move! Robert McCloskey got the idea for this book while living in Boston. ""I noticed the traffic problem of the ducks, and heard a few stories about them. Then the book just sort of developed from there."" (from the dust jacket) Make Way for Ducklings is a sweet story with fabulous drawings by the author (all in brown pencil - no bright, multi-colored pictures). The drawings have a very old-fashioned feel - check out the cars in the pictures! - which I really got a kick out of. The story itself is timeless. A bronze statue of Mrs. Mallard and her ducklings (one has a tendency to wander off, er, get stolen from time to time) greets visitors to Boston Common while the book itself has never been out of print since 1941 and has sold over two million copies! If you go to Amazon to purchase, be careful about buying used copies. Because the book is so old, used copies apparently can be old, creaky, smelly, etc. The copy I bought is brand new. Quill says: If you've never read the book, or haven't seen it in a long time, check it out. Your kids should enjoy it as much as you did a ""few"" years ago."
1447,Make Way for Ducklings,0670035386,Robert McCloskey,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"A classic - give it often for a gift at a baby shower - or, just recently to new grandparents - with the bronze statues of Mother Duck and her ducklings so close in Boston for children to eventually see and the swan boats and pond - what more could you ask for as a gift."

I read it years ago and decided to buy it again for my Nook and it was well worth the money all over again. It was my first introduction to Agent Pendergast who has since become one of my fav fictional detectives and the first but not the last Preston & Child book I read. Loved it! Great blend of mystery, horror and police procedural. I have read every Pendergast novel since and can't remember ever being disappointed. I would definitely recommend it."
1448,"Relic (Pendergast, #1)",0765354942,"Douglas Preston, Lincoln Child",Barnes and Noble,4.3,PainFrame,"Better than the movie.

Hey, I LIKE the movie (Yikes - those special effects do not hold up!), but the book is much better.

The quote on the cover says that this book is &quot;Far above Crichton's Jurassic Park&quot;. Now, of course that's crazy nonsense, but there are similarities between how Crichton writes a thriller and this story. Namely, the plot unfolds at a good clip, and is interesting and suspenseful enough that I always roll right into the next chapter. Also thought the end was great, if I had book 2 handy, I would already be halfway through it. A great start to the series!"
1448,"Relic (Pendergast, #1)",0765354942,"Douglas Preston, Lincoln Child",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Peggy Schmidt,"This book was a great mix of science, history, and fantasy.  The action moved at a good pace and kept me interested enough that I finished it in just two days."
1449,Notes from a Small Island,0380727501,Bill Bryson,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Sarah_R,"I had already read Bryson's A Walk in the Woods when I picked up this one for my trip over to England for a few weeks. I always like to read when I travel. Soon, I found out that I had selected the perfect book for a trip to England. Bryson has this amazing way with words that can actually make a reader laugh out loud-- it's not every day I can find myself on a plane or the Tube with ipod buds in my ears, a book in my hand, and laughing a bit too loudly for the people seated around me. 

For one, being in the same country Bryson is writing about only adds to the hilarity of his stories. I could chuckle right along with him, feeling as though he's giving me a knowing nudge, when he writes about the enormity of the English breakfast (beans? for breakfast? really?). Or, even better, when in London, he says, watch the ground for a gentle reminder that, in England, you must ""Look Right"" when you step off the curb. (For those of us from the States, we should look left in our home country.)

I'm glad this was a book I picked to read during my trip. I don't think I could have found a better selection. This Bryson travel memoir is, by far, my favorite. And I love all of his books."
1449,Notes from a Small Island,0380727501,Bill Bryson,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Guest,"As an Englishman in Houston, I recommend this book to everyone who says 'I keep meaning to go there'. The daily annoyances and minutiae of English life are well dealt with, and I had to fill the stereotype by laughing at myself. Bryson is saddened by the English ability to do away with fine architecture, and fine life, in search of something more modern, but the most surprising thing -- except to an Englishman -- is how little has changed since George Mikes wrote 'How to be an Alien' sixty years ago (not available in the US; try www.whsmith.co.uk)."
1449,Notes from a Small Island,0380727501,Bill Bryson,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Guest,"This book was very funny and entertaining.  Bill Bryson is extremely witty and sarcastic about all of his different experiences he lives through while touring Britain.  I lived in England and have read Bryson's other works, so I tried this one out.  I think you must be British or very familiar with the culture to fully appreciate this book.  Bryson visits the big cities, but also many small towns that I have never heard of, and therefore found hard to imagine.  My lack of British knowledge did not gravely affect my enjoying this book very much.  Bryson retells his traveling experiences that we all can relate to, and others that we can be glad never happened to us.  This book delves deep into the British culture; past London and Dover, and into samll towns and seaside resorts.  Bryson also includes his take on life, lightheartedly criticizing different groups of people and expressing his admiration or exasperation regarding these people.  I found this book thoroughly enjoyable and a light, funny, and educational read.  I recommend this book to the traveled person who has an appreciation for the English culture."

Mab calls in one of her favors that Harry owes the Sidhe, Queen of Air and Darkness. Harry can not refuse Mab on this one, because of the SI crime scene investigation of a building torn by ritual magic. And not just any magic, but Very Powerful ritual magic. Together, Harry and Murphy are drawn into an investigation for the missing person/Baron/criminal, Marcone. Taxied by Thomas, and with the aid of the Knights Michael and Sanya, Harry gets in way over his head, (as usual), when he must battle the Denarians, Summer's gruff brothers, and himself, (with two black eyes and a broken nose), all while trying to save the kidnapped Marcone and tortured Ivy. With the overwhelming fear of the Denarians' possession of the Archive, more is revealed about Ivy, her role, her childhood, and her parentage.  Also, Nicodemus' conversations clues Harry in finding who is behind the Black Council. Harry will barter everything he has, including the sword Fidelacchius and their advantage in their collection of the silver coins, in order to try and stop the long term, destructive plans of Nicodemus. Harry shifts his romantic eye away from Murphy and onto Luccio, which I do not care for at all. Table conversations with Luccio will show a secret that Dresden is hiding from the White Council about Bob.  With the realization that the war between the Knights and Denarians can finally come to an end soon, Michael sees that he can simply be a father and husband to his family.  Or, will a life altering accident allow the possible archangel to continue to be a Knight wielding Amoracchius?  Can Harry repay the favor to Uriel, whom his godmother has warned him about?"

The author is not afraid of shocking and pissing you off. You may find a character that you love and that seems crucial to the story line and then like if the end of the world was actually happening they get snatched away from you. I get lost in these comics, they are just amazing. If you love comics, read it. If you don't like comics, read it. If you can't read, learn to read and then read it. No joke, it's that good."
1451,"The Walking Dead, Compendium 1",1607060760,Robert Kirkman,Barnes and Noble,4.6,BenjaminBailey,"There are things in life you can count on, that you know for sure you will have to deal with one day. Remember the famous saying, ""Nothing is certain except death and taxes and the dead rising from their graves to feast on the living.""? Well, in order to prepare for the inevitable zombie holocaust, in between games of Left 4 Dead, read The Walking Dead.

Drawn in stunning black and white, The Walking Dead is far from your typical comic book tale. It is a story we all know, one of zombies infesting the world, wiping out most of mankind and a small group of survivors that must learn to work and live together in order to survive the horrors of the world. Where The Walking Dead separates itself, is that it never promises hope. There is no cure, no army waiting to save our survivors, nothing. It is about survival, pure and simple.

Writer Robert Kirkman and artist Charlie Adlard deliver the bleakest book on the shelf, and it is incredible. Each issue horrifies and pushes the limits of the horror genre in any medium. The characters are never safe, and just when you get attached to someone, they are consumed by the never-ending wave of undead or worse yet, one of their fellow survivors. The Walking Dead can be hard to read at times, and that's part of what makes it so good.

So, before there is no more room in hell and the dead begin to walk the Earth, read The Walking Dead. It's an awesome comic book and you might even learn a couple survival tips. If nothing else, it will keep you from running to the nearest shopping mall like an idiot when the undead begin to roam free. That's the first place they'll look for you."

The protagonist Miri's yearning is to work in the quarry like everyone else on Mount Eskel, but she is too small to fulfill her dream. One day, a delegate from the royal court comes to Eskel saying that all the girls on the mountain must attend the academy to learn how to become a princess, and at the end of their stay at the school, the prince will choose a bride. Miri, of course, must go to the school, and there the girls face bitter treatment from Tutor Olana. But Miri finds herself in the reading and writing aspects of school and befriends some girls while making enemies with others. Who will the prince choose? What are Miri's friends hiding?

A book worth every star, Princess Academy is a lovely book that kept me reading all night. Princess Academy is a beautifully written work of art about fourteen-year-old Miri, who is sent off to the Princess Academy in hopes of being chosen to be the Princess. Though discouraged by her peers, Miri helps save her friends, her enemies, and herself. The book shows that even the smallest things can make the largest difference. I applaud Shannon Hale for her skill in writing."

Is that not every girl's dream? It may be most girls', but not Miri's. Miri may not be too excited about marrying a lowlander, even if he is a prince, but she does want to impress her father, and her older sister. Miri agrees to be sent to the Princess Academy, a large building set in the mountains of Eskel. She and the other girls learn proper etiquette, and they are taught how to bring out the strong conscience in all of their minds.  Miri, Britta, Esa, Katar, and other girls are sent to the academy and get punished for no reason at all. Can Miri prove that while she may be small, she is strong?	Miri is a skinny, mischievous girl, who believes that anyone can overcome their fears and any approaching evil. She is aided in her many pranks by her best friend, Britta. Britta is a lowlander, not born on Mount Eskel. Britta despises Olana just as much as Miri, and has helped Miri throughout the story. Olana is the harsh, determined, fiery, and forever changing antagonist of the story. Many other secondary characters, including Knut, Esa, Katar, Frid, Pa, Peder, and Marda, are all important people to Miri, and they all support The Princess Academy in their own important ways, perhaps fighting off bandits, or chipping pieces of linder off the sides of Mount Eskel.	 This book is a hilarious, heartwarming, and surprising mix of love stories, fantasy, rebellion, independence, and cooperation.  The Princess Academy, written by Shannon Hale, also author of Goose Girl, sets a model for other girls to be strong and to listen to their hearts. This realistic fiction book has a plot loaded with action, keeping you on board, interested, and able to connect yourself with the characters, giving you a clearer picture inside the characters' plots, making it easier to enjoy the book. Shannon Hale has written a multitude of books, all just as good of a page turner as The Princess Academy, a heartwarming book for all ages."

1454,Pygmalion,0486282228,George Bernard Shaw,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"In George Bernard Shaw¿s Pygmalion, the storyline centers around three main characters:  Eliza Doolittle, Professor Henry Higgins, and Colonel Pickering.  Eliza Doolittle is a flower girl who gives herself to the tutelage of Professor Higgins and Colonel Pickering to learn proper grammar and phonetics.  Eliza can be characterized as a very sensitive and emotional person  she seeks to be treated like a duchess by men.  Her personality clashes with the personality of Professor Higgins in an extreme way.  Professor Higgins is an arrogant, work-obsessed expert in phonetics who views Eliza simply as an experiment.  He is a bachelor who has never found a place for women in his life due to his obsession with language.  Colonel Pickering is a gentleman from India who is also an expert in language.  He is more genteel than Higgins and treats Eliza with respect while maintaining a professional interest in her similar to that of Higgins.  These three comprise the main action of the novel as Eliza learns speech of the upper class from them.  She manages to pass herself off as a Hungarian princess at a formal party.  This achievement gives credence to the efforts of Higgins and Pickering.  After experiencing life in the upper class, Eliza settles for a lower class life with a suitor who loves her for what she is.  After petty disputes, Eliza and Higgins remain friends in the time after.  Other memorable characters include Mrs. Higgins who maintains an authoritative figure over her grown son and Mr. Doolittle who rises from a dustman to become a well-respected speaker in the community.  I think that this is a good book because it shows that happiness can be achieved without wealth and fame.  I highly recommend it due to its emphasis on grammatical and phonetic correctness, a dying art in this time period."
1454,Pygmalion,0486282228,George Bernard Shaw,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"I found Pygmalion to be a charming novel full of wit and feeling. Eliza Doolittle becomes empowered through self-respect, not the love of a man. Though Professor Henry Higgins altered her mannerisms and speech, it was ultimately Eliza&rsquo;s inner strength that made her a lady. Her realization that before the glamorous dresses and elaborate diction, she was the girl she wished to be inevitably gave her a new sense of independence and self-respect. &ldquo;Pygmalion&rdquo; is not merely a play about turning an impoverished flower girl into a duchess, but one about turning a defensive and insecure girl into a confident, strong, and independent woman, through means unforeseen until the very end. It was not the glamorous transformation, but the inner sense of self-worth that changed Eliza for the better. For once the heroine does not fall for the hero, and instead makes her own independent and love-filled ending. All in all, I found George Bernard Shaw's play to be enjoyable and meaningful."

I read it that year and have been reading it ever since. I am obsessed. I have 5 versions of the play, an illustrated classic, the movie, and the soundtrack. ( My Fair Lady ) In am in fifth grade and Eliza Doolittle is one of my favorite characters of all time. The story has effected me in more ways that I can count. So loverly. There is one version that I have of the MUSICAL. have no idea how my mother found it, but it is the entire thing with the songs and the lyrics. It is one of my most prized posessions. My favorite songin the musical is... I Could Have Danced All Night. It is so beautiful. The enchanting Julie Andrews and Rex Harrison captured the role of Eliza and Professor Higgins beautifully. Then later, the fabulous Audrey Hepburn took the role of Eliza in the film version of brilliant Bernard's play. It's no wonder why Julie Andrews and Audrey Hepburn were chosen for the role of Mrs. Doolittle they are so talented and where absolutely perfect for the role."
1455,Flight Behavior,0062124269,Barbara Kingsolver,Barnes and Noble,3.9,MatthewK17815,"Written with rich, realistic characters and a fascinating premise, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  This is my first book by Ms. Kingsolver but I anticipate many more enjoyable moments spent with her books in the future.   Can nature change your life?  It certainly seems so for the main character Dellarobia Turnbow, who has almost what could be described as a vision, though it is a real event, on her way to an illicit affair one morning in rural Tennessee.  The arrival of monarch butterflies in the woods near her home changes her life and outlooks on almost everything she knows.  All the characters are exceptionally written and real; they could be people I know, work with, am friends with.  Interlaced with the telling of Dellarobia's domestic life and the changes brought about by this miraculous and at the same time disastrous natural happening are also insightful commentaries via the character of etymologist Ovid Byron about climate change, the nature of science and the media, our places in the natural order, and whether or not we are too late in our efforts to save this planet from the atrocities we have inflicted on it's natural systems and beings.  I can not think of a better work of fiction I have read this year and would without reservation recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good novel and especially to those who care for the state our planet is in and want to have a better understanding of what's at stake and how nature can affect  every one of us, whether scientist, homemaker, or average Joe.  A great read!"
1455,Flight Behavior,0062124269,Barbara Kingsolver,Barnes and Noble,3.9,TheRelentlessReader,"Flight Behavior offers a fresh view of climate change and the surrounding issues. It's easy to have grand ideas about how to fix it, but on the ground it's complicated, confusing and sometimes frightening.

&quot;I think people are afraid to face up to a bad outcome. That's just human. . . . If fight or flight is the choice, it's way easier to fly.&quot;

Though science is at the heart of this novel it is written in a lively and accessible way.

The best part of this book is the main character Dellarobia. She is doing the best she can with what life has thrown at her. She reminded me of women I know. She reminded me of me.

If I were you? I'd put this book on my wish list.

1457,"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (Bridget Jones, #2)",0140298479,Helen Fielding,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Kimberly_Book_Addict,"Bridget Jones is back and better than ever in her second novel entitled Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason. Enticed by Helen Fielding's first work in the series, Bridget Jones' Diary, I couldn't stand not knowing how Bridget got on. Influenced by Jane Austen's Persuasion, Fielding throws us back into the world of Bridget via her hysterical diary entries for another trip as we get to see what makes this interesting woman tick. Bridget Jones has been dating her boyfriend Mark Darcy for four weeks!  Life is great: her weight is down, she's smoking less, and her relationship is going fantastic (at least she thinks it is). Mark begins talking about a woman he works with more and more, dropping little ""Rebecca"" bombs here and there. When Bridget meets Rebecca out at a bar one evening and finds out about a law society dinner that Mark hasn't mentioned yet, she loses it.Being a self-help book junkie she begins thinking the worst about her relationship. Her worrying leads to nothing, as Mark asks her to the dinner a few days later. The law dinner comes and goes, as does a very special Valentine's day where Mark tells Bridget that he loves her. The two soon find themselves invited to Rebecca's parents country estate for a mini-break where Rebecca does everything in her power to separate Bridget and Mark.  Rebecca wants Mark as her own so bad that she tells her nephew that Bridget and Mark are breaking up and that Bridget is free for the taking. He tries to kiss Bridget, and before she can throw him off Mark and Rebecca walk in and see everything. The two end their weekend by breaking up which sets Bridget into a major funk. Will Bridget ever be able to convince Mark that he's the only one she loves? Helen Fielding has created one of the FUNNIEST literary characters ever with Bridget Jones.  I literally could not stop laughing with this book.  Those who have read the first Bridget Jones book know that Bridget is OBSESSED with Colin Firth, especially Colin Firth as Fitzwilliam Darcy. Fielding writes an eight page interview between Bridget and Colin Firth that is honestly one of the funniest things I've ever read. The way Fielding writes Bridget's thoughts are uncanny, making me feel as though I were reading my own thoughts at times. I really liked the pace of the novel as well. It moved along at a quick enough pace to make the reader enjoy the story but not feel bogged down by detail. Fielding writes a lot of things with abbreviations and short hand, which makes The Edge of Reason a fairly fast read. The way in which she infuses her work with the Persuasion storyline works perfectly and naturally. For those fans who have seen the movie version, be prepared for some major differences. He is limited to part of a scene here and there. Instead, the book is filled with additional hysterical storylines, with my personal favorite being the one about the construction worker who blows a hole in Bridget's wall and leaves it there for the course of the entire novel. This book is chock-full of the relationship ups and downs that many women experience in life.  What's great about Fielding's writing is that she makes fun of the way women sometimes react, such as the obsession with self-help books and the advice our friends and parents give us.  She finds humor in the way we exaggerate every little event in life, and that's what makes her books so enjoyable.  I highly recommend the series.

1458,Corelli's Mandolin,067976397X,Louis de Berni??res,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"This remarkable book brilliantly captures both the horrors and idiocy of the Second World War without leaving the confines of the small Greek island of Cephalonia.  De Bernieres obviously loves his characters, and consequently so does the reader. The book swings from rich humor to abject misery effectively, and the love story between Pelagia, a Greek woman, and Antonio, an officer of the Italian army that is occupying the island, is real and touching.  Their love is an antidote to the barbarity closing in around them. The secondary characters also come to life, and Mussolini¿s monologues, interspersed among the chapters, are a brilliant commentary on megalomania.   The descriptions of life in the village on Cephalonia are both funny and moving, the battle scenes are horrifying, and the indecision of the Italian army's brass is so stupefying it still makes you angry sixty years later. I was surprised that the book went beyond the war years right up to the `90s, a touch I had mixed feelings about.  But overall I thought the book a modern classic.  Too bad the movie wasn¿t up to the standards of the book; if you¿ve seen the movie don¿t be put off ¿ this is a touching book you will enjoy."
1458,Corelli's Mandolin,067976397X,Louis de Berni??res,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Maerajean,"I like the idea and even most of the characters for this story (though a few of them are caricatures), but the author was very long-winded. While it's good for the author to be intimately familiar with all the details and back story for the events and characters of his story, the reader doesn't need or want to know all of it. With Corelli's Mandolin, the author could have cut out a lot to give the story more impact."
1458,Corelli's Mandolin,067976397X,Louis de Berni??res,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"The vocabulary can be quite crazy and strange which is challenging but also funny.

1459,"At First Sight (Jeremy Marsh & Lexie Darnell, #2)",0446698466,Nicholas Sparks,Barnes and Noble,4.2,K_56_R,"Nicholas Sparks At First Sight was a book that kept me wondering. Is Lexie cheating on Jeremy? What else has she kept from him? These were the questions I kept asking myself. This story about two people in love after just meeting really shows that love at first sight is real. From the ups and downs that couples face every day, Sparks almost in a way sped things up. In less than a year, Jeremy, a man from New York City and his wife Lexie, from Boone Creek, North Carolina, were moving in together, getting married, and having a baby. I really enjoyed this book for many different reasons. It showed that love is hard but if you really love a person nothing will matter and love always gets through the tough times. I have to admit though that the end of this story was not what I expected and I was completely shocked. This story will make you laugh, cry, and think about the ones you love in a different way. I would tell anyone to read this story; it truly is an amazing book."
1459,"At First Sight (Jeremy Marsh & Lexie Darnell, #2)",0446698466,Nicholas Sparks,Barnes and Noble,4.2,AliSunshine,"At First Sight is a wonderful book that explores love and human actions caused by guilt, jealousy, and trauma. The main theme is love and how it makes humans act and the results of that. It also talks a lot about marriage and intentions vs. actions. Another theme is telling the truth, the difference between lying and not mentioning something, and the greater effects loss of trust has on people. The book is about the young couple Lexie and Jeremy Marsh and their adventure through the beginning of their marriage and the birth of their first child. They move down to a small town named Boone Creek and buy their first house. Their relationship is a roller coaster but through the ups and downs and you really begin to sympathize with the characters. Jeremy a writer from New York is the protagonist in the book, and you learn all about his sacrafices he makes for love and to begin on a new journey different from anything he's ever been used to. I loved the way the author set the book up, there are unexpected twists and turns behind every chapter, and nothing goes as planned. You feel the story come to life as you begin to have a deeper understanding of how the characters think and feel about each other. However, if your looking for a light happy read, that leaves you feeling better about life, this may not be the best choice for you. It's a heavy book and times makes you feel very sad, but it is also one of the best books I have ever read. I would rate this book a nine out of ten because it's a wonderful read and I enjoyed every page. I would also recommend any other books by Nicholas Sparks, because I have found all his books to be great reads, and have not been disappointed once when reading his books."

1460,In a Sunburned Country,0767903862,Bill Bryson,Barnes and Noble,4.3,www.LindaBallouAuthor.com,"The first time a read this book I enjoyed it. The second time I read it,  a couple of years later after learning a great deal more about Australia from other sources, I loved it. Bill Bryson does not take you to the typical tourist stops. Rather he takes you to many places best avoided, but he explains why in the process. His focus is on odd happenings in history, and quirky people he meets along the way. He is always researching museums and reading local papers to ferret out more little know factoids about the place. He does not spend a lick of time at the Great Barrier Reef except to tell us about the couple that was left there to try to snorkel thirty miles back to shore.  They were most likely eaten by sharks as they tried to reach a buoy resting on the other side of a deep channel where the big boys roam. Instead, he takes us to the distant shores of Western Australia, a place so vast that it has never been completely explored, to stare at blobs of matter called stromatolites credited with being the first bits of life in our universe. No matter where we are he always throws in a bit of sly, self-deprecating humor.  Fun read chock full of information and insights into the people and the place down under."
1460,In a Sunburned Country,0767903862,Bill Bryson,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Gusboy,"If Bill Bryson wrote all the history books, history would become every student's (and everyone else's) favorite subject. I've read most of Bryson's books and have been educated and entertained by them all. ""In a Sunburned Country"" is not a history book, but is about all kinds of facets of Australia, including history, the culture past and present, the geography, topography, animal and plant life, and the residents. Bryson makes it all incredibly interesting. I learned a lot, laughed quite a bit and enjoyed the book thoroughly."
1460,In a Sunburned Country,0767903862,Bill Bryson,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"I immensely enjoyed this book...  Considering the fact that I've learnt more about my own country from a traveller of origins elsewhere probably says something, not the least of which about my good self.  But that is the beauty of Bill Bryson: the most seemly dull things transform into small realms of genuine interest and consideration.  With that said, who better to write a book about Australia?  Quite an enjoyable read."
1461,The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes,0192123092,Arthur Conan Doyle,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"The second collection of Sherlock Holmes short stories is just as good as the first, though most of the stories here are shorter than in the previous book. That just means that this book can be enjoyed even by people who have short attention spans or a lack of time to read longer stories.    The important element of this book, of course, is the final story, which introduces the reader to Sherlock Holmes' arch enemy, Professor Moriarty. It must have been rather odd for the English reader at the time to have Sherlock Holmes' final adventure be against a man whom they had never heard of before, and for it to happen in such a way that you can't say for sure exactly what happened is both maddening and very creative. Of course, more stories followed (I'm not even halfway through my collection at this point), but from here on out the reader knows how it all ends."
1461,The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes,0192123092,Arthur Conan Doyle,Barnes and Noble,4,Dollycas,"Sherlock Holmes, the world's best-known and most-loved fictional detective, is more popular today than ever. This collection presents many of the most familiar cases Holmes and his assistant, Dr. Watson, ever solve, including ""Silver Blaze,"" ""The Greek Interpreter,"" and ""The Musgrave Ritual."" As Holmes's fame grows, it brings him notoriety that piques the ire of London's criminal underworld, who begin to scheme against him. It is in ""The Final Problem"" that Dr. Watson relates the grisly, fatal, and shocking tale of how Holmes finally meets his match, encountering the diabolical Professor Moriarty in a terrible struggle at Reichenbach Falls. 



I have to start out by telling you that when I was asked to review this book, it took me only seconds to respond.  My husband and I are huge Sherlock Holmes fans. 
Exhibit #1 Our Cats Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson and Professor Moriarty.


Back in the days when there were just 4 television selections, ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS, chances were pretty good that late nights on Fridays or Saturdays there would be a Sherlock Holmes movie on at least one of the channels.  My favorite Holmes was Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce was my favorite Dr. Watson.  But today with the Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes movie starring Robert Downey, Jr. and its sequel coming out in December there is a whole new audience for the Arthur Conan Doyle character. If you are a fan of the television show House you would also notice many similarities between Sherlock Holmes and Gregory House.  In fact many episodes contain actual Holmes references. For example in the season two finale, House is shot by a crazed gunman credited as ""Moriarty,"" the name of Holmes's nemesis. Today I just found this article that says CBS is working on a modern day Sherlock Holmes story. BBC already has out their own contemporary series. There are even cartoons based on the characters and books written about Holmes for all grade levels.

I guess what I am trying to say are these stories are timeless and can be read again and again at any time in your life. 

Be sure to go see the new movie in December.  I am not sure I like explosions and shooting but that's what is in all suspense movies these days.



I am more a fan of the Holmes in this book who uses his deductive skills, perceptions and sharp observations to solve the cases. This is a fantastic book for the older fans like me and a great way to introduce new fans on how Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson started out.  The first story was published in 1887 and the character of Sherlock Holmes is still relevant today.  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has truly created characters that are timeless and who I ""deduce"" will be with us in one form or another forever and ever.

1462,The Orphan Master's Son,0812992792,Adam Johnson,Barnes and Noble,4,code7r,"When I started reading this book, I wondered if it was science fiction, where I was taken to this ""Big Brother"" planet where a society totally lives in fear under the rule of a madman. It has hard to digest that this was an actual place on earth at this time and age. It is about life in North Korea and a character named Pak Jun Do.

We begin by meeting Pak Jun Do at an orphanage that his father works at. Being an orphan is considered being one of the lowliest persons alive. Although Pak Jun Do's father works there, everyone he meets thinks he is an orphan and immediately forms their opinion about him.

We follow Jun Do through his unbelieveable and haunting life where he seems to be the puppet of those above him. He is forced to become a kidnapper, an intelligence officer that lives on a fishing boat, a prisoner, and eventually tortured. Throughout this, he has one thing to cling to, his love for the national actress, Sun Moon. We do not know his original name, but then he becomes Jun Do in the orphanage and then becomes others as the book progresses. In a society where you can ""replace"" a husband, or a wife, etc., and accept that as reality, Jun Do becomes who he needs to be when he needs to be.

I am so fortunate to have received an advanced copy of this book. I do not think it is a book I would have picked up on my own to read. Once I started reading, I was hooked. The author weaves Jun Do's different lives in and out of one another, and jumps from the present to the past and back again. It was confusing in the beginning, but once I figured out what was going on, it made the journey more interesting.

It really opened my eyes to the injustices that are occuring in North Korea and makes me thankful that I live in America. I would encourage others to read this book so they, too, can learn about life in North Korea"
1462,The Orphan Master's Son,0812992792,Adam Johnson,Barnes and Noble,4,JoeJohnIII,"In The Orphan Master&rsquo;s Son Adam Johnson brings to life the concept and reality of North Korea as only a master could. He knits together reality with one of the great fictions of movie history (Casablanca) but transcends even Rick&rsquo;s character with that of Jun Do, the orphan master&rsquo;s son. Jun Do&rsquo;s character starts at the lowest rung in North Korea, an orphan, at least an orphan due to the denial by the orphan master to even acknowledge him as his son. Jun Do&rsquo;s launch outside the orphanage starts with carrying out clandestine missions for the State (as directed by the Dear Leader Kim Jong Il) where he shows promise in learning foreign languages, then moves to high adventure at sea where he rises to hero status only to fall from grace. His subsequent incarceration exposes him to a camp where exhausted workers suffer their grisly terminal exploitation as unwilling blood and organ donors. Then almost by accident he manages to transform himself to a new identity as the second most powerful person in North Korea, one regarded with paranoiac fear even by Kim Jong Il. It is the last transition that allows Jun Do the pleasure of finding his Ilsa, the most beloved actress in all of North Korea for whom Kim Jong Il personally writes scripts and secretly loves. Along Jun Do&rsquo;s winding trail, Johnson introduces a myriad of heterogeneous characters extending from two American women rowing around the world to North Korean fishermen pressed into service to sponsor spies and carry out absurd personal missions for the Dear Leader&rsquo;s whims. Jun Do and his fellow cast members reveal a state that most of us can only imagine&mdash;one devoted entirely to Kim Jong Il and his obsessions, his world view, his total control of information, his complete disregard for common morality. Fear permeates and dominates every person&rsquo;s single day, their every action, their every &ldquo;private&rdquo; conversation. Johnson&rsquo;s lively writing uses diverse strokes to paint this wide ranging action to evoke both acceptance and rejection by his characters&rsquo; anima. Using fascinating style and imagination, he weaves together so many emotions and conditions from despair to cautious hope to probe a culture with which few of us are at all familiar that his book deserves a read, maybe two to savor it fully."
1462,The Orphan Master's Son,0812992792,Adam Johnson,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"This is one heck of a read.  I found myself thinking ""if this is even 1/10th true, what a horrific place North Korea is"".   It was very hard to read, but at the same time, irresistable.  When I couldn't bear to read another page, I'd put it down, then realize I wanted to find out what happened to each character.  Hard to follow all the character voices, but hang in there.  It's LONG but worth it in the end."

Due to the trials of being an outspoken modern girl in this oppressive regime, she must leave her family and live alone in Austria to finish her education. There, she loses herself before finally coming to terms with her own identity. It was a heartbreaking memoir. The story and art were very dark, but humorous as well.

Marjane¿s entire life from growing up as a young child in Iran to the present day as a full grown adult in France is depicted through strange but beautiful drawings in the format of a very long cartoon, making it appealing to the eye and all the more interesting.  In the book, as the rebelious Marjane Satrapi grows into an adult woman, you can see how through the many troubling bad times she has been through, she becomes proud of who she is and her background and culture.  This deep and passionate story is recommended to all young adults and adults interested in lives of children growing up in revolutionary Iran.

1466,The Agony and the Ecstasy,0451171357,"Irving Stone, ?????????? ??????????",Barnes and Noble,4.1,carlosmock,"The Agony and the Ecstasy by Irving Stone

Although Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni , commonly known as Michelangelo, was born on 6 March 1475, the book opens on April of 1488, when  Michelangelo was 13 y/o.  

If you take Wikipedia's entry on Michelangelo's life, you'll have a cliff note version of the novel, however, The Agony and the Ecstasy is not only the ""biographical novel"" of Michelangelo; but much more than that, it is the story of the Italian Renaissance in all its glory. Through Michelangelo's eyes one gets a full feeling for Florence and Rome at the time. Stone paints with a broad brush the stories of wars, feuding princes, religious machinations, and the wonderful art that the Renaissance produced.   

This novel is also an analysis of the struggle that is necessary to create. We experience the creation of just about every major work of art of Michelangelo and the personal struggles that went into the creative process. We see the artist as he struggles with family, princes, popes and other artists to get his designs accepted. Michelangelo started an apprentice on painting at age 13.  He convince his father to allow this by having his master pay to his father instead of the opposite.  However, Michelangelo  soon discovers marble, and from there on he is smitten by sculpting.  In Michelangelo's own words: 

""The painter draws to occupy space, the sculptor to displace it."" (p.78)
""...the painter draws to externalize, to wrench a shape out of himself and set it on paper; the sculptor draws to internalize, to pull a shape out of the world and solidify it with himself."" (p.78)
""No, no, cutting stone does not take strength out of you, it puts it back in."" (p. 82)
""If I don't have wonderful sculptures to show that the years have passed, then my memories will be truly bitter."" (p. 618)

His work was commissioned  and interrupted by the powers that be: The Medici's, the popes, and royalty: making him move-back and forth-from Florence-his true home-to Bologna, and Rome.

In his 89 years of life ( died 18 February 1564) he had three  loves: Contessina Medici (consumed), Vittoria Colonna (not consumed and she died a virgin even though she was engaged at age 4 and was married), and Tomasso de Cavalieri, an apprentice thirty years his junior (not consumed, but Michelangelo was accused of having a sexual affair with him.                                                                                                                                        
The book is truly the glory of a life well lived as the artist dies leaving a truly monumental body of work behind. A masterpiece that is a pleasure to read."
1466,The Agony and the Ecstasy,0451171357,"Irving Stone, ?????????? ??????????",Barnes and Noble,4.1,MRmedici,"This is the best book I have ever read!  The writing style is great, the characters are dramatically tied together and very in-depth. The deep look into the great life of the mast Michelangelo Buornarotti was not only highly informational, but incredibly exciting.  His run-in with Pop Julius II, his escaping of his home town (Florence), and his illegal disectionals of corpses in Santo Spirito are all extremely capitavating!  If you are a lover of history, the Renasissance, artists or Michelangelo, this will be the best historical novel you can possibly read.  I happen to be interested in all of the above subjects, so this book definitly heads the list of novels that I have read.The ability of Stone to use primary sources to dig deep into the real lives of Michelangelo and all of the other characters really super-charged this novel.  It was more than a novel, and more than a history lesson, it was a journey through a life! The ups and downs, highs and lows of the most stubborn and genius artist of all time absolutely comes to life here!  A page turner with information that makes you yearn for more, a most read!"
1467,"The Angel's Game (The Cemetery of Forgotten Books, #2)",0385528701,"Carlos Ruiz Zaf??n, Lucia Graves",Barnes and Noble,4,YoyoMitch,"The length of this volume could have been drastically reduced by better editing in the first act, entitled ""City of the Damned."" This section strives to become the foundation for the remaining two ""acts"" and does so overly well. The hero, David Martin, is a writer, the son of a mother who abandoned him and his father shortly after his father returned from the Spanish ""War in the Phillippines"" a broken and haunted man. When David was in his early teens, his father was murdered in front of him. Fortunately, he was employed as a writer at a rather ""raggy"" daily newspaper and his writing caught the eye of a wealthy benefactor who made it possible for him to become a featured writer. As expected, the other journalists grew jealous and he was sacked after a year. He becomes a highly read author, who is contractually required to use an alias, nearly losing everything else in the process and that is where the story becomes intriguing. It is also the end of ""act one.""
The following two ""acts"" detail the relationship David develops with ""the boss,"" Andreas Corelli, a mysterious publisher who commissions him to write a book that ""will capture the world."" The path this writing leads our hero, the people he meets and the problems he encounters in the year following his meeting Mr. Corelli, makes the last 261 page a much quicker read than the first 139.
This is a much darker novel than was The Shadow of the Wind. The Sempere & Sons' book shop and the Cemetery of Forgotten Books are welcomed old friends returning from that novel, however, Mr. Zafon takes the reader into an entirely different aisle in the world of literature with the writing of this work than was his leading in the previous novel. This is as a bloody a tale as is it dark. By the end of the book, I was weary of the body count and discouraged by the ""cheap"" manner in which Mr. Zafon was dealing with the conclusion of his tale. I was discouraged, that is, until the epilogue, when the picture was complete and the story was shown to have no wasted bloodshed. Each action was as necessary, and usually painful, for David as it was for the reader. There are no nightmares to be found in this book, only the sorrow experienced by those who feel compelled to write then share that part of their soul with the world.
There is a decided Spiritual dimension to this parable. David wrestles with an evil who befriends him, yet the price for that friendship far exceeds the benefits given. He is confronted with the miracle of life, magic, love, and mystery all by his skill as a writer, yet he refuses to glimpse beyond the material to see the Real. Mr. Zafon is either a lapsed Catholic or a very radical practicing one, as his understanding of religion is seeped in ritual and he presents faith as something that is deeply personal but just as deeply powerful. Even the title of the book is a hint of the Spiritual nature of the story, as he understands the Biblical idea of ""Angel"" as a messenger and who is not always a welcomed guest.The love Mr. Zafon has for literature is evident in this, and in his previous, novel. There are references to Dickens' Great Expectations, homage to Goethe's Faust, Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray and a host of other great novelist's works are evident in this tale. Mr. Zafon does not plagiarize the other works, he only honors them with incorporating their ""flavor"""
1467,"The Angel's Game (The Cemetery of Forgotten Books, #2)",0385528701,"Carlos Ruiz Zaf??n, Lucia Graves",Barnes and Noble,4,TrishNYC,"This has to be one of the most frustrating books that I have ever read. The first 100 pages made me want to pull out all my hair because though interesting in general, it was long winded and could have been 50 pages shorter. 

In 1920s Barcelona, David Martin is a young man who has been orphaned at a very young age. But he is lucky in his patronage as his mentor is Pedro Vidal, one of the richest men in town. Through Vidal, he gets a job at the local paper where he soon excels writing a pulp fiction serial. His stories are an instant hit and widely embraced by the populace. Unfortunately, his success turns friends at the paper into foes and he is eventually forced to leave. He finds another job and is contracted to a long term deal with two unscrupulous publishers, writing under a pseudonym. One constant through this period is the presence of a mysterious man, Andreas Corelli, who wants David to come work for him. Through a confluence of different events that break David's heart and spirit, David would eventually agree to a contract with Mr. Corelli. Shortly after he makes this agreement, his former publishers suffer brutal and mysterious deaths. David has nagging doubts about Corelli but the money that he is offered and the freedom that comes along with it prove to be temptations that cannot be passed up. 

But as David writes this book, his doubts continue to grow. Who exactly is Andreas Corelli?What kind of publisher pays an exorbitant amount of money for a book that he never intends to publish? Also what is the relationship between Corelli and the former occupant of David's house? 

This book is beautifully written and melds elements of mysticism, the supernatural and features very intelligent debates/discussions of the nature of religious belief, faith and the human search for meaning. The author is obviously a very talented writer whose love for the written word is apparent. In his writing he pays tribute to the masters like Dickens, Bronte, Wilde, etc. His writing is lyrical, magical and in his hands, Barcelona becomes a dreamlike locale that I am now dying to visit. But before I could get to the place where I could say all this about the book, I had to survive the first section of it which just seemed to go on and on and on. Honestly, I believe that many people will get so frustrated with this first section that they may give up and therefore miss out on a truly great book. I wish that this portion of the book was trimmed down because it detracts from the overall work. Another problem with the book was that I felt that too many characters were introduced that sometimes I lost count of who each person was. This could have easily been a 5 star book but these two factors made me rate it lower. 

But all in all, it is a very well written book that does not leave you with easy answers. By the end of the book you are unsure of who is victim or villain. You do not walk away with a clear sense of who the hero is or if there is even one."
1467,"The Angel's Game (The Cemetery of Forgotten Books, #2)",0385528701,"Carlos Ruiz Zaf??n, Lucia Graves",Barnes and Noble,4,CathyB,"In ""The Angel's Game"", I was transported to Barcelona, albeit the Barcelona of the 1920s. Through Mr. Zafon's descriptive prose, Barcelona was brought to life. I got a chill reading about the Pueblo Nuevo Cemetery with its 'forest of angels and crosses' and the  scenes that took place within its walls. I could hear footsteps echoing in the alleyways, smell the putrid stench of decay, feel the neglect of  buildings abandoned long ago,  and see 'the whole of Barcelona stretched out .' (pg 50) before me. Mr. Zafon has also created several memorable characters: David Martin, the tortured narrator; Andreas Corelli, angel or demon; Isabella, a kind and generous soul; etc.... These characters stayed with me long after I finished reading. They seemed to inhabit my dreams.

Mr. Zafon's novel centers around a young writer who unwittingly makes a pact with the devil. Yes, a Faustian bargain; however, there is more to the novel, namely, there is an underlying mystery that will have you guessing/thinking throughout the novel. The story moves quickly. I found myself repeatedly saying I have time for just one more chapter. I read the book in three days - because life interrupted and I needed sleep. It is a book that you will not want to put down.

People have commented that this book is one in a series and a prequel to ""The Shadow of the Wind"". I have yet to read that book and did not find myself at a disadvantage. I believe that this book stands on its own quite well and highly recommend to those that have read previous works of Zafon or those who like mystery/thrillers."
1468,"Love, Rosie",0786891084,Cecelia Ahern,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Buttercup100,"Love Rosie, I borrowed it from a friend because she thought I would like it, and oh my god I loved it! What can I say this book immediately hooked me and I loved how it is told through letters, e-mails and chats. I couldn't understand how a lifetime and story could be told through those modern ways of communication and still get the message across perfectly. Ahern is excellent at inventing this story and I would hope it would keep going. The book has you anxiously waiting for Rosie and Alex to discover their love and there is no better way to portray it. The journey goes from broken dreams to success with strong problems as well as laughter and happiness. And as we all imagine and dream after every storm or inconvenience there is always the rainbow, so Rosie's strength, faith and hope takes here to accomplish everything she ever dreamed of. Rosie's life adventure has you on the edge of your seat, and at some parts relating to her is so easy, and helpful. The book is divided into 5 sections, and time passes so fast which makes you realize that that is also the way we live our lives. We have to realize to stop and think once in a while, because then we're never going to know what happened all those years.

	Seeing how Rosie and Alex's lives unfold over a long period of time is very interesting because we see how the fall, make mistakes, accomplish things, and their happy and sad moments. Sometimes you get angry when seeing their reactions and want to throw the book to the trash but in the end it's worth it. I loved how there is no need for a narrator until the end and Cecilia manages to control every situation. The summing of the whole storing in the last few pages makes you reflect even on your own personal life, and I think it gives us a very powerful message. In the end you discover all the knots from the plot and it's just amazing. Another interesting thing I loved from the story is the way in which people come in and out of your life and you never know under what circumstances you'll be with them again. This is referring to the part where Rosie hates her teacher and ends up working for her. I think this makes us realize that we have to act our best always, and that the people you hate might be the people helping you up someday. I am dying to read another book from this author as she has succeeded for the second time in making me enjoy reading. I had previously read PS I Love You and consider here a very good author and I can relate a lot with her love for romantic stories and chick flicks."
1468,"Love, Rosie",0786891084,Cecelia Ahern,Barnes and Noble,4.1,chinchillapyruvicacid,"Everybody seems to know that Alex Stewart and Rosie Dunne are meant to be, except for them. They have been best friends since childhood, trusting each other with every secret. They get into innocent trouble together and live many adventures that make their friendship bloom into a caring, strong, never ending friendship. Just when they began too see each other as more than just friends their perfect plan of a future relationship is ruined with the news that Alex is moving away from Dublin to Boston. After being best friends all throughout their childhood they are separated during their teenage years. They keep in touch via letters and email but have a hard time maintaining the strong bond they once had. They create the perfect plan that includes Rosie applying to collage in the US to continue what they had started. Rosie got into Boston University and Alex into Harvard. Everything seemed to be falling into place when bad news strikes again. Rosie is pregnant with the baby of a guy she went to her prom with after Alex couldn't make it in time for her prom. Rosie's dreams crash by the birth of her baby and she has to stay in Dublin as a single mother to take care of her new baby girl, Katie. Both move on and live separated lives, maintaining communication. Alex pursues a medical career in Boston while Rosie stayed in Dublin as a single mother. As they grow older they ignore the fact that they are destined for each other, finding love in other people. Crossing each other's path once in a while they realize that fate will not give up on them. 

The author, Cecelia Ahern, communicates Rosie's story through letters, emails and text-messages. The creative way the author chose to communicate with the reader makes the story more interesting to read. This charming story about friendship and love is mostly directed to teen audience considering the topics the story touches. When reading this book you really feel connected to the characters due to the fact that the author decided to place the characters in very realistic situations. The life long love the two main characters in the book experience is like no other, you will not be able to put the book down. The book starts out with a letter from Rosie to Alex inviting him to her seventh birthday party and ends with a letter from Alex to Rosie when they are fifty years old. Their feelings about each other are equal both ways but they never manage to confess them. The feelings get stronger throughout the book, even with the distances they are forced to suffer. They live their lives as if nothing were different, both knowing how they felt about each other."

It was hard to face that fact sometimes.It was easy to relate to..

After finding the mess Amelia made of her list of instruction, Mrs. Rogers was about to fire Amelia when Mr. Rogers helped   Mrs. Rogers taste the wonderful pie.Reading with my children is so much fun, now they are reading to me, this is one of our favorites.  The way Amelia misunderstands the instructions on the list is humorous and also points out how easy it can be to misunderstand someone¿s meaning or intent.  This fun story really helps open communication and even though some of the references (trim the fat or draw the curtain) have to be explained, the opportunities that are opened are  wonderful."

Mr. Cameron has the imagination and the talent to pull such a story off with style and panache. The dog's story, divided into a series of separate lives, comes together at the end with inevitable and still surprising results.

5 stars

I received an e-ARC copy of Ember in the Ashes from the publisher and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

This book was a thrill ride. I do so love it when a book lives up to its potential.

Laia has lost her whole world. Her brother is arrested, her grandparents are murdered and her home razed to the ground. Desperate
 to free her brother she goes to the resistance, bargaining to spy for them if they will help her. Elias is a mask, the deadly highly trained 
assassins of the empire and he is the best of his class. After graduation he plans to leave is all behind, find the freedom he craves 
away from killing.  But the empire is changing, the trials for a new emperor have been announced and Elias is a candidate. Laia is 
now a slave tasked with spying on the trails. Their paths will intercept, entwine and carry the fate of the empire.

I LOVED this book. The world building is intriguing, there is no info dump but I never felt lost.  I love how there are different cultures 
and each is different but I never felt that it was hammered at me at any point. There were so many layers, it was terrific. 

Elias was my favorite character. He wanted out of being a mask but was conflicted about it. He thinks the empire needs to change but 
he&rsquo;s not going to join the revolution.  Elias is complicated and everything is wrapped in layers. It was fascinating and I really can&rsquo;t wait 
to see where he ends up. I loved his complicated relationship with Helene. She&rsquo;s his best friend and he could love her like she loves 
him but it would complicate everything. I love how he knows that but because he cares about her, he wants her to be happy. I had a 
slight quibble with all of Elias&rsquo;s friends because I could never tell them apart but that kinda was a moot point. 

Laia was okay in the beginning. She is naive and even though life is hard, she has been pretty sheltered. But it all gets ripped away 
and Laia spends most of the book trying to get that shelter back.  It takes her a while to realize even if she can save her brother things
 aren&rsquo;t going back to the way they were before.  However when she does realize that she embraces it, which made me happy.  I did 
want her to stop trusting everyone. She is so lucky it didn&rsquo;t get her killed.  But my favorite thing about Laia was that she wasn&rsquo;t the strong
 kick butt heroine, she was a scared girl doing everything in her power to save the only piece of her family left and she is willing to do 
whatever it takes afraid or not. 

I liked all the other characters. Helene was my favorite, I can&rsquo;t wait to see her again. I&rsquo;m super curious to see how Darin&rsquo;s time in prison 
has changed him (If he can manage not to die).  The swordsmith was awesome, I want to see him again. There is a bit of  a love triangle
 (two of them really), but they didn&rsquo;t bug me much because the other things that are going on are so much more important. As long as 
the triangles take a backseat to the plot and the war everything will be fine. (an no dithering, I hate dithering).

So loved, loved, loved,loved.  Great writing, tight plot. I need there to be a next book.

Possible spoilers..
So predictions for the next book (which there absolutely has to be). The Augers are actually the coven the trapped the Jinn. 
Which is why the Nightbringer can cloak from them.  Cook is going to be super important. We will get to see more of the Tribes (weee). 
The resistance spy will be revealed (Mazen I&rsquo;m looking at you)."

The text itself is fluid, easy to read and extremely engaging. Tahir allows you to experience the world she has created through the lens of two characters, Laia and Elias, who are profound and beautifully developed throughout the course of the novel.

Absolutely wonderful. I'm almost upset I read it this early knowing I will have to wait for a sequel."

Ward,Barnes and Noble,4.3,DogLoverNYC,"I've read many of the reviews from readers of this book and I'll have to say that I too, was left shaking my head after finishing this book. To my dismay, I found myself frequently wanting to quit before I finished the book because the hero was so annoying. I started reading the series, oh, perhaps, 2 weeks ago. So, I really followed the brothers from book one to book six within a relatively short time period. Call me obsessive...usually, if there's a series I take a shine to, I'll just keep reading it. (Admittedly, I slowed down with V's story...boy, that one was pretty bad, as well) Luckily, I'm a really fast reader. Anyway, I really took to Phury from the beginning of the series and boy, as a hero, he could not have been more disappointing. Well, maybe he could have been, but then he'd have regressed into this psychotic, whiny addict with no personality. Oh, wait, that was how he played out. So, yeah, I go back to my supposition that he couldn't have been a worse hero.I've always been the kind of reader who liked an action packed book with a mandatory twist of romance added in. I have been on a ""vampire"" kick and enjoyed the first few books because of the interesting plot line. The others in this series were obviously filled with more romance than this one but the comparative lack of that in this book didn't actually bother me at all. Just give me a hero/heroine to believe in. Please. And then I'm happy. Is that too much to ask for?To me, the unfolding plot lines were what made me continue on with this book...except I became more and more frustrated at how incompetent the brotherhood was starting to look as the book continued. Hey, the lessers were kicking butt and putting the brotherhood to shame. If this continues, the civilian vampires should start hoping that the lessers somehow develop a change of heart and decide to protect them, not destroy them; after all, the incompetence seen in this book by the saviors does not bode well for the race as a whole. Hopefully Ward starts to reinfuse some confidence in the brotherhood with her next book. Then again, Rehvenge isn't exactly a brother is he?"

The characters are great, and I got the romance between Phury and Cormia. What is bothering me though is that J. R. Ward has turned two guys I thought were going to be two more great stories into a gay storyline between the two warriors. There aren't too many more male characters left to write about and I was looking forward to Quinn and Blay's story but now I'm just not. No offense but I am not interested in reading about guys into other guys no matter how nicely written. I want to read about hot hetero warriors because I am a woman who loves to read about sexy girl/boy couples not sexy boy/boy couples and if you are going to introduce more male characters with gay lifestyles you should be fair and give equal time to girl/girl couples. Now that would be different and maybe more interesting.

JR Ward has done an outstanding job at weaving together many intricate stories that progressed nicely together.  I'll be honest, Phury is not my favorite of the Brothers; he's way to self-destructive with a martyr complex to match.  However, he is not unredeemable.  If you are a diehard BDB fan, this book is a must read!  This installment wasn't just about Phury, Cormia and the Chosen, but instead was portioned off with crucial scenes that will have effects on future books with John, Blay, Quinn, Xhex, Tohr, Rhevenge, Lash, the Glymera and others.  It also appears that the Lessers have a sleeper cell in the vampire community and when activated is programmed for maximum annihilation.  The reviews for this book seem to be brutal with a bulk of them asking where the romance is or Phury's HEA; but to be frank, this book was more in the dark urban fantasy genre than any of the previous BDB books.  I highly recommend this book and series to dark urban fantasy readers.  I also look forward to Lover Avenged."
1474,"The Golem and the Jinni (The Golem and the Jinni, #1)",0062110837,Helene Wecker,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Dieverdog,"I really enjoyed this book. It was truly unique and I loved the characters - they were very well developed and I'm picky about that. It had a great fantasy premise that was written well enough to seem plausible. The story really drew me in and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Even the secondary characters were interesting and had nice depth. 

I also liked getting a flavor of turn of the century New York. The idea of it being in little Syria gave it a unique twist and the Jewish community was fascinating to me also. There was so much to like about this book. The writing was well crafted and had a nice pacing to it. Enough detail to bring it to life but not so much it got bogged down. The plot moved along nicely and kept me interested. 

Both the golem and the jinni had their flaws but that made them interesting. I really wanted to find out what would happen to them.  I would thoroughly recommend this book."

Until I read ""The Golem And The Jinni"" by Helene Welker. 1899 NewYork presented as well by anyone since Caleb Carr. Characterization, time, and place like Dickens.
Not as dense as Rushdie so accessible by more readers than eggheads like myself. I usually read a book in a day or two, this one I streched out to two weeks like nibbling a great meal."

1477,Bleak House,0143037617,"Charles Dickens, Nicola Bradbury, Hablot Knight Browne",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"I never read Dickens in school or college and since have felt that perhaps I missed out on something. Recently I have sought to make up for the lack in my education. I find that I am glad I waited this long to read him. I doubt I would have appreciated him as much in my more impatient years.     Bleak House is the second Dickens novel I have read. It's a complex story with a very large cast of characters. At first the indidents seemed unrelated but further reading reveals a carefully constructed tale with surprising turns. This is a book for the patient reader and not one to be hurried through. The writing style does not lend itself to a rushed reading. The payoff is high however, as there are some fabulous turns of phrase and characterizations. In some places I was moved to tears -not something that happens often with me- and in others I was indignant. There is a reason that Dickens has been referred to as the greatest English novelist of all time. Bleak House is one of them.    The original Nonesuch edition was the ultimate Dickens but sadly was out of reach for most collectors. This edition is a finely made reproduction. The printing and pictures are exceptionally fine. Some of the intricate detail can only be seen with a magnifying glass. The spine is beautifuly textured bonded leather with cloth boards and embossing on the front cover. The cover is protected by a clear plastic dust jacket. The binding is sewn and the book lays open nicely.     I don't think you could find a more beautiful Dickens anywhere, yet these are easily affordable for the collector. I sincerely hope to see the other 17 Nonesuch volumes produced by Barnes and Noble."
1477,Bleak House,0143037617,"Charles Dickens, Nicola Bradbury, Hablot Knight Browne",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"I've undertaken to read all of Dickens' major works, from 'Oliver Twist' to 'Our Mutual Friend'. Having recently finished 'Bleak House' I can give it a hardy recommendation with one caveat: the character of Esther is the best example of the worst aspects of Victorian morality.  The intrigue, the murder, and the mysteries, are all examples of Dickens at his best; but how can one be sympathetic with a heroine whose annoying, self-effacing, yet self-aggrandizing, modesty causes the novel to continually grind to a halt?  If not for this highly disagreeable character this would be Dickens' best. When there are hidden and underrated treasures like 'Barnaby Rudge' in the Dickens canon, I think 'Bleak House' can be put aside and read another day."
1477,Bleak House,0143037617,"Charles Dickens, Nicola Bradbury, Hablot Knight Browne",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"I'm a big Dickens fan, and this is probably my favorite of his novels. Unlike a lot of other Dickens books where the story is a little disjointed, jumping from location to location and sub-plot to sub-plot, this book stays very much on point and very little is extraneous to the ultimate ending. Although the characters are perhaps not as memorable as those in some of Dickens' more well known novels, they are extremely well developed and perhaps more relatable to the reader. What separates this book from many of DIckens' other novels, for me at least, is the non-storybook endings that many of the characters encounter, and the struggles that nearly every character in the book faces throughout. Altogether, it makes for a really enjoyable read. I couldn't recommend this book more; it is a must read for Dickens lovers and anyone with the patience to read an 800+ page book."

1479,"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, #1)",044101268X,Jim Butcher,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"I enjoy Butcher's Dresden Files series. However, to my mind the Codex Alera series is as different from Dresden as Tolkien's Lord of the Rings is from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The Dresden files are written in the first person and set in the more-or-less real world.  The Alera books, however, are third person point of view and switch between characters periodically. Also, the books are set in a fantasy world (Carna) with a Roman-influenced human empire surrounded by other, non-human races. There are fewer funny lines than in the Dresden Files books, but this book builds an entire world with an interesting and original magic system.     I read all 440 pages of this in roughly 24 hours - I started it before work, and wound up reading it during breaks and late into the night after work. I actually liked this better than the Dreden Files because of the shifting viewpoint and the original world-building in it. Although this is the beginning of a series, Butcher doesn't leave the storyline of this book unresolved. Instead, the further books in the series pick up new and different threads using the foundation laid here."
1479,"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, #1)",044101268X,Jim Butcher,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Candace885,"This first book in the Codex series is more of a historical book than an action packed sci-fi adventure.  If you are new to reading a series take into consideration that you have to explain all the main characters and learn what this new world is and what is good and bad in it.  I would strongly suggest reading the first 2 books in a series to see if you really do like it.  You may end up saving yourself a lot of money by not buying them all or realize it is great and become a huge fan of the author and series.  To me the book starts off a bit slow.  The first half is about learning what the furies are, how they are used in society, who the key characters are, and their background drama.  Once you hit the midway mark the action picks up. You get involved in the book.  The hero in the book Tavi is a great character.  He has strong morals, is very  intelligent, clever, and an endearing young man.  As the book builds momentum I found myself rooting for our hero big time.  I look forward to the next book in the series to see how well the authors story continues and sets up for a long series.  This was my first Jim Butcher book and I gave it a four star rating due to a very strong and happy ending.  The great thing about this is it is not along the lines of Terry Goodkind or Robert Jordan or Tolkien which is great for a change.  No wizards, mord sith, elf's, or sorceresses which of course abound in this genre.  So I found it very refreshing to have a new world, with new magic's, and less wickedness.  Jim seems to be pretty good at creating something unique and new to me.  I recommend reading it if you are new or old to sci-fi fantasy.  I enjoyed the adventure and can't wait to pick up the next one in the series.  Happy reading all."
1479,"Furies of Calderon (Codex Alera, #1)",044101268X,Jim Butcher,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"I was afraid to read this book as in my experience when an author branches off and tries to invent a new set of characters too many parallels can be drawn between books and it becomes a same old same old. I was very pleased that Mr Butcher brought new characters out of the bag and i really enjoyed this book and am looking forward to the next two. The only parallels i can draw between Codex Alera and Dresden Files is full of action, well developed characters and cant put it down! Not Witless at all!"

I used to hate books, but then i read this one...I think it's the combination of adventure, a little bit of a romance, and a girl just trying to find herself that makes it great. I can relate to Alanna so much.  The characters are so real, too, that it's hard to forget that they really aren't real.

Enjoyed the story.   Written for a very young audience (4th-6th) and the simplistic style reflects that.  Starts slow but has a lot of action in the middle.   That pattern occurs throughout the series with long segments that are slow followed by a short segment of high action.   One note of caution for very young readers is that there are several seemingly forced segments where the heroine considers whether to have sex.   In every case she decides that it is ok as long as she likes the fella and has her charm against pregnancy.  I thought it was a very mature topic handled in an immature manner by an immature character.   It was not explicit in any way, however.   Some young readers may be uncomfortable with the chapter on the young woman coming of age (learning how to deal with her period)."
1481,Her Fearful Symmetry,0224085611,Audrey Niffenegger,Barnes and Noble,3.4,BoysGirl1985,"I could have perhaps enjoyed this book, though the plot was not the most original. The characters ruined it for me though. There was not a single character in this book that I found likeable. Julia and Valentina annoyed me to no end, always dressing alike, sleeping together, feeling that any career one of them chooses must involve the other... They are so co-dependent. And then when Valentina finally decides that she is going to ""leave"" Julia, she can't wait six months and move out? She has to do something so drastic that causes so many people pain? It didn't make any sense and I felt like she sort of deserved what she got in the end. And the same goes for Julia.

Elspeth obviously was probably the most self-serving character in the book, based on her actions at the end. I liked Robert well enough, even if he wasn't overly interesting, until the very end, when he proved to be just as selfish as the rest of them.  

The twins' relationships with much older men was also completely creepy. 

I have read books before where I didn't like the characters but still enjoyed the book, because the characters were meant to be disliked (i.e. ""Wideacre"" by Phillipa Gregory). However, I think the author of ""Her Fearful Symmetry"" meant for the characters to be likeable, and they weren't. At all. 

I give the book 2 stars because the writing was decent, and I enjoyed the atmospheric descriptions of the cemetary. But I really can't recommend the book as a whole. The conceptualization of life-after-death was also sort of interesting and unique, so that was nice. But the few positive things about the book don't make up for the awful characters. I wanted to strangle every single one of them at some point or another. They make horrible decisions that are based solely on their own wants and needs with no regard for the well-being of the other people they supposedly love. Again, that's fine if your characters are meant to be an anti-heroes or -heroines, but not fine in a book where you want your readers to like and sympathize with them. 

Skip this one."
1481,Her Fearful Symmetry,0224085611,Audrey Niffenegger,Barnes and Noble,3.4,alisons-bookmarks,"From the first page, I was drawn into Audrey Niffenegger's new novel and could not put it down.

Not a character in the traditional sense, but the building where the twins live in London is adjacent to the famous Highgate Cemetery which takes on a life of its own. Ironically, the cemetery is not where the spookiest events occur. Instead, it becomes a sanctuary of sorts, or a canvas upon which to tell this ghost story. 

Niffenegger explores the twins' relationship, which on its own is compelling, as she peels away each layer and exposes one dysfunction at a time, it becomes the heart of the whole piece.

That is not to say the author doesn't develop the other characters and the other relationships in the novel. Martin and Mariyke's relationship alone could have easily supported its own novel. Their relationship was just as fascinating to me as any of the others. 

 You have to let yourself go there, to this alternate reality that Niffenegger creates for her readers. Once you do, the story will pull you in, and these characters will, pardon the pun, haunt you.  

I find that I must say something about The Time Traveler's Wife.  While the two books share a certain spirit, they are both beautifully unique.  If Ms. Niffenegger chooses to take another 6 years to write her next novel, I am okay with that, as long as she continues to bring us brilliance."
1481,Her Fearful Symmetry,0224085611,Audrey Niffenegger,Barnes and Noble,3.4,Anonymous,"Considering the critical and commercial success of ""The Time Traveler's Wife"", Niffenegger's second novel has a lot to live up to. Within its elegantly written pages are familiar themes: dysfunctional families with terrible secrets, love overcoming great obstacles, and life after death. As you may expect, the author takes these conventions and breathes new life into them. ""Her Fearful Symmetry"" is dark, labyrinthine, beautiful, and unexpected. The story will leave you thinking about it long after you are done reading. And isn't that what every great novel should do?"

This book about Addie Baum the first American born child o
f Russian Jewish immigrants who was born in Boston in 1900
. She is telling her granddaughter in 1985 the story of her life. It a rags-to-middle-class story. 
A lot of the book shows how the settlement programs for immigrants provided the children of immigrants
 opportunities for education and friendship. I liked the fact that the book was about poor immigrants;
 Many Americans are forgetting about their poor immigrant roots. 

However, I thought the ending of the book lacked a punch. 
The book needed some kind of climax. Furthermore, the book lacked a strong message. 
It missed some of the qualities of top fiction such as conflict between characters and a lead character 
who will mature and grow over time.

Ward,Barnes and Noble,4.6,BekahSC,"I know a lot of readers were dissatisfied with the last book, but one of the highlights for me was the insight into Rehvenge's life and the secret he's been so desperate to hide. Although I have to say, that part about the barb? Um... ick. Rehv has always been one of my favorite characters in the BDB world so I was pretty excited to finally get my hands on this book, and I have to say, it does not disappoint. The story moves forward in leaps, characters develop, Lash comes into his own as the Omega's spawn and Rehvenge gets a beautiful, heartbreaking love story. Ehlena turns out to be perfect for him, both strong and compassionate, and their blossoming romance is sweet and super hot. One of the things Ward does is write multiple story arcs for each book so there's a huge chunk about Wrath's struggle as King, Tohrment's torturous return to the land of the living and John Matthew's disillusionment at the hands of Xhex. There's even an appearance by Payne who gives Wrath a beat-down, proof that there's something in the works about her eventually joining the Brotherhood which I'm super excited about. I wish I knew what characters Ward was going to write about next, but I'm really really hoping for Tohr's story, and I would love to see him and Payne end up together.

The Black Dahlia is the first in his LA Quartet, and I haven;t read the other three novels in the Quartet yet, but The Black Dahlia is a MASTERPIECE.  I rarely give this title to books, but the Black Dahlia deserves it.  Characters, prose, dialogue, plot, all of these aspects of a crime/mystery novel are tip-top.  As the characters fall into madness over the investigation into the grisly murder of Elizabeth Short, I felt what they were feeling and became obsessed in the novel.  Ellroy's writing style is what achieves this.  This is not a large novel, it's about average size i would say, but it has the pacing of an epic and gave off the feeling that I had known these people for a much longer time.  Ellroy packs so much information and story in just a single page and he does this with his short, punchy prose that jumps right off the page.  The Black Dahlia is a masterpiece in all of literature, just be warned: this book will make you made with the desire to read more.

P.S. This book is also very violent, almost to the level of Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy, not that that is a problem with me because both of these books are masterpieces.  Enjoy."

1487,Wild Swans: Three Daughters of China,0743246985,Jung Chang,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Benz1966,"It's strange how things work out.  I randomly picked Wild Swans out from the list of 1001 Books to Read Before you Die.  I can't tell you why I chose it, except that (as I do with all of the books I read from that list), I just scrolled through it and stopped and pointed my finger and that was the book I would request.

Then.. I noticed that it was due back to the library so, after reading my Book Club's selection of Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet by Jamie Ford, I decided to move on to Wild Swans.  This.. was a good decision.  I knew nothing of China - especially China under Chiang Kai-shek and then later on, Chairman Mao.  I got a glimpse of the hatred that one of the main characters in &lt;i&gt;Hotel&lt;/i&gt; had toward the Japanese (being from China himself), but still had no idea the extent of the torture, the pain and the horrible version of life going on within China's borders.

After I began to read Wild Swans, people around me started to talk about it (without even knowing that I was reading it).  I was asked at my book club if I had read Wild Swans and asked by two random people I know through daily life if I'd ever read this book.  Before I began to read it though.. I'd never even heard of it.

So I should talk some about the actual book.. since this is technically a review.

First - it's non-fiction. It's readable, in its own way.  Although very densely packed with names, dates, places and events, I was able to easily follow the lives of Jung Chang's grandmother, her mother and herself through the changes of China.  

This is not an easy book to read and you shouldn't pick it up unless you are willing to be thoroughly invested in learning difficult names, reading about difficult things and prepared to have your eyes opened to something that, in my opinion, is not taught about enough.  I've always considered China to be a country of mystery - one that I always hear rumors about.. and honestly, if I hadn't been working my way through the 1001 Books, I don't think I would have willingly chosen this book to read.  I chose to begin reading through the list for that very reason, to expose myself to books I wouldn't normally choose and this book is a prime example of why.  I consider myself enriched by learning the stories of Jung Chang and her family and blessed to not have to endure even a small fraction of what they had to endure.

There are times I believe that the right book comes along at the right time to be read, and this was one of those books."

I reread that book every few years. When this book was selected by my book club, I looked forward to reading it. It was a slow, miserable process. I never could connect with the characters.

1489,"On the Banks of Plum Creek  (Little House, #4)",0060885408,"Laura Ingalls Wilder, Garth Williams",Barnes and Noble,4.6,rainbowdarling on LibraryThing,"On the Banks of Plum Creek is possibly one of the more interesting tales of the family's journeys. The live in a dugout, deal with blizzards and wild animals, but also have neighbors and a town close enough to visit when the weather isn't too bad. The cast of characters changes slightly because of the nearby town and suddenly life seems to be more than just about the Ingalls family. I liked the storytelling, too. Laura doesn't claim that she was a model child, or even that her sister Mary, though better behaved, was a model child. The two squabble, they struggle with tempers, jealousy, greed, temptation... normal human afflictions. I felt like I was a part of the lives of the people in the story, so alive they came off of the page."

Mr. King, as usual, has kept me up half the night and commanded my attention from the first page until the last.

I AM his Constant Reader and he still leaves me wanting, wanting.

I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. Stephen King once again scooped me up and dominated my waking hours with his spell."

MERCEDES, King crafts a story that is not only thrilling and intense, but one that grapples with the ideas of how art, specifically novels, impact both reader and writer. The ending is chilling and will leave you waiting with impatient hunger for THE SUICIDE PRINCE, the final installment. Great for summer reading. A page-turning masterpiece."
1490,"Finders Keepers (Bill Hodges Trilogy, #2)",1501100130,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"Mr. King does it again! I liked this even better than Mr. Mercedes! Mr. King brings back all of the gang from that book. If you didn't read it, I suppose you could read this as a stand-alone novel because King does a good job of filling in the blanks on how the characters are connected. That being said, I would really suggest reading Mr. Mercedes first as you will be that much more invested in the characters.

If you have already read the first, let me just say this is a fantastic followup! I really like this cast of characters. Apparently, Mr. King has more in store for us with these guys. The ending isn't exactly a cliffhanger, but King has definitely left it wide open for another. I did read a review saying this is going to be a trilogy, but I don't know that for sure. Suffice it to say that there will most likely be at least one more with an ending like this one. 

As far as age-appropriateness goes, this is Stephen King folks. There is some cussing and, in typical King fashion, it can be pretty graphic. This is not one of King's typical horror stories, more along the lines of a straight forward murder mystery, although it is definitely told in typical King fashion. It is creeper horror, building in intensity until nearing the end when you cannot put the book down!

Thank you Stephen King for another great novel! I love your stuff and am always anxiously awaiting the next! Keep them coming!

1491,"The Strain (The Strain Trilogy, #1)",0061558230,"Guillermo del Toro, Chuck Hogan",Barnes and Noble,4.1,storker,"I am an avid reader sometimes finishing 6 books a week.  I have always loved the thriller genre and was looking forward to this book.  I read it in one sitting and was not diappointed in it.  I have never taken the time to write a book review until The Strain..  The book pulled me in from the very beginning at the airport and never let up.  It reminded me of a conglomerate of the writing of Dean Koontz, Stephen King, and Robin Cook. Although the plot seems almost preposterous I believe the cental characters made me come to accept the storyline.  It is well written and exciting and I cannot wait until Book Two!"
1491,"The Strain (The Strain Trilogy, #1)",0061558230,"Guillermo del Toro, Chuck Hogan",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Richard_Szponder,"Normally, I'm turned off by novels written by a team of writers.  Perhaps that's because I'm a writer myself, and I cannot comprehend how the creative process can be unselfishly shared with another.  Had it not been my passion for two of Guillermo Del Toro's film projects, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and ""The Orphanage,"" I more than likely would not have read The Strain.  What a tragedy that would have been, for this novel is one of the most exciting and page-turning stories I have encountered in a very long time.

The story opens with one of the most uniquely bizarre events ever dreamt.  An overseas flight arrives in New York.  Upon taxiing to the terminal, the plane stops.  All of its electrical functions cease and communication is lost.  Upon examination of the plane, all of the passengers and crew (with the exception of four individuals) are found dead.  What ensues is an outbreak of a unique blood infection that transforms its victims into blood-thirsty, vicious vampires.  

No, these are not the romantic and handsome vampires of modern fascination.  Fans of Sookie Stackhouse or the Twilight series will be mortified if they read The Strain.  Nor are these the sophisticated and classy drawing room vampires of Anne Rice of Bram Stoker.  Del Toro's and Hogan's vampires are monsters, whose bodies transform into something other than human.  Their mouths widen to reveal a long and sharp tongue-like appendage that slashes at their victims' necks to begin the blood flow.  Think of the vampires in Matheson's I Am Legend or consider some of the more recent Zombie films like ""28 Days Later"" or the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead.""  These creates are more comparable to the vampires in The Strain than any of the more traditional vampire roles.

The Strain takes off from page one and does not stop, even at the end of the story.  Before reading the book, consider that it is the first in what is to be a trilogy.  Therefore, do not expect any resolution to the major conflicting issues in the book by the end of this installment.  Also, I do not recommend reading this book unless you have a significant chunk of time to devote all at once.  Its short chapters, non-stop action, and lingering suspense make it a true page-turner, one that is very difficult to put down.  It is written perfectly for development into a film.  Characterization and internal conflict are lacking, but the descriptive violence and unique nature of the monsters make up for any missing elements.  Highly recommended."
1491,"The Strain (The Strain Trilogy, #1)",0061558230,"Guillermo del Toro, Chuck Hogan",Barnes and Noble,4.1,nerveghost,"Well, if you're idea of fun includes vampires, biological horror, scary folk tales, and the undead walking the earth, then I have a recommendation for you:

THE STRAIN - book one of the trilogy of novels from Guillermo Del Toro and Chuck Hogan.

If you're a big GDT fan (and I assume you are because you're reading this blog), then you are getting some classic, old school Guillermo here. This is his triumphant return to horror in a whole new medium.

The end result?

BLADE 2 meets CSI.

THE STRAIN is not a meditation like PAN'S LABYRINTH, or a metaphorical folk tale like THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE. It is an in-your-face horror thriller that is not for the squeamish.

Needless to say, I really enjoyed this book. It is very well written and honestly, I couldn't put it down. For my money, nothing holds my interest like a vampire plague, and this book has some cool new twists to the vampire mythology.

The premise of a vampire ""infecting"" its victims with a virus is not completely new: I've seen the idea before. What THE STRAIN does well is explore the infection of the unfortunate victim in great detail. The main character of THE STRAIN is Ephraim Goodweather, epidemiologist for the Center of Disease Control. His investigation as to the nature of this sudden and mysterious plague requires understanding the nature and effects of the virus itself.

In other words, the entire book is like playing in GDT's sandbox of the scientifically weird and grotesque. It is a medical journal for Guillermo's vision of the ultimate vampire.

Talk about Gross Anatomy.

I won't spoil anything about the vampires for you - that's the best part of the book - but I will say that they bare a striking similarity to the Reapers in BLADE 2. I know Guillermo said that he wasn't able to fully realize the Reapers the way he wanted to in that film, so perhaps this is finally his perfect vision of a vampire: grotesque, horrible, thirsty and a perfect evolutionary predator.

The wonderful part about THE STRAIN is that the novel is the perfect medium for bringing GDT's vampires to life. You understand them inside and out (literally), but also you'll get uncomfortable access to the thoughts and fears of those who are infected...or are being infected.

And that's stuff you'll never get from a movie, so consider it the ultimate bonus feature."

1493,"Old Yeller (Old Yeller, #1)",0060935472,Fred Gipson,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"Who was Old Yeller? Old Yeller is a stray, ugly, and a thieving dog. Old Yeller protected Travis' family. Travis' dad is away for 4 months. Old Yeller and Travis developed a very special bond.
    Travis is not Yellers real owner. His family found him at their house chasing their horses. He was a strong and courageous dog. Yeller was a big help on the wild Texas frontier.
     Old Yeller protected Travis' family from any kind of danger. He protected them from a coyote. Yeller was my favorite character. He was an excellent guard dog.
      I connect to this book because Old Yeller is just like my dog dog Emma. They both steal things. I love Emma just the way Travis loved Yeller. 
      I recommend you to read this book by Fred Gipson to people of all ages. It is a very classical book. The book is about a dog that helps a family. I think people will enjoy it the same way I did."

Some secrets are humorous, some are tacky and some are touching.  At work we borrowed the theme and ideas from this book by asking people to post their 'secrets', we then used these post cards to advertise and bring attention and focus to important topics.  We debriefed afterward and realized the complexity of our environment and the small details one can often overlook.  It is amazing the quality conversations that can come from a simple testimonial post card.   This is a great idea and a great book."

Some secrets are funny, some ironic, and some are very very sad, but they're all real.  A lot of the cards by themselves are beautiful.  It's the kind of book that makes the world feel a little smaller..."

I read and re-read the one in the school library, til school closed for the summer. As luck would have it, I found the book and it's subsequent additions that summer in a book store. They were the only thing I ever BEGGED my mother to buy me. I took home The Borrowers, The Borrowers Afield, and The Borrowers Afloat, and I still know parts of them by heart. When I was 18, the Borrowers Aloft came out, and my mother sent it to me at college. I was 36 when the Avenged came out, and I RAN to the bookstore. The stories are as fresh today as the first time I read them. I'm now in my 50's, and I can't imagine a life without Homily, Pod and Arriety Clock. Homily who is courageous, even though she'd really rather not be. Pod, who is a simple man, taking care of his family. And Arriety, 13,  ready for life, ready for adventure, a young Victorian Feminist, if there ever was one. She wanted to learn to Borrow, which was only for men.  She needed to learn to Borrow, because her family was the last one left in the house, and what would happen to her if her parents died? She taught me that a girl could be anything she wanted to be. They bravely faced a daunting world, and they're only 6 inches tall. I now own well over a thousand books, and really believe that it was this small family that led me to my love of reading."

1498,Hearts in Atlantis,0340818670,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,This is one if the most underrated King novels. Captivating.
1498,Hearts in Atlantis,0340818670,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"In HEARTS IN ATLANTIS, Stephen King gets in a few more pokes and jabs at his detractors, the ones who consider him a schlock-meister. They are the 'legitimate' literary establishment, 'book snobs,' but ol' SK still seems to be trying to break into their ranks. He may have done it with this collection of two long and three short stories bound by recurring characters, the lost cause of a certain police action in Southeast Asia, and that horrible, beautiful decade that defined King's Boomer generation, the Sixties. His faithful readers will recognize his New England landscape and theme of innocence lost, but these stories offer little resistance to novice King readers.  HEARTS IN ATLANTIS might be considered King's magnum opus; time will tell. He's a prolific guy, sometimes brilliant and sometimes not, but man, does he know how to tell a story. There are times between this book's cover that you can almost touch the difference between the Stephen King who wrote CARRIE and the one who wrote this. It's not just fun and games and a good clean scare anymore; there's a depth to King's writing here that, while hinted at in some of his early works, has revealed itself fully in HEARTS IN ATLANTIS."

However, in comparison with his other works, I found this one a bit scattered and affected.

As I haven't read this book in English, I cannot comment on the translation, but I know that this is a fabulous book to follow up the first two and surpasses them.

1501,"The Queen's Fool (The Plantagenet and Tudor Novels, #12)",0743246071,Philippa Gregory,Barnes and Noble,4.3,BANCHEE_READS,"I loved this book. My favorite Gregory novel is The Other Boleyn Girl, and this comes a close second.
Other reviewers have criticized the author for her portrayals of Mary and Elizabeth in this book, but everyone needs to keep in mind that we are viewing these women through Hannah's eyes, and this is fiction, not a historical textbook.
Hannah is a very likeable character, who struggles throughout the book to come to terms with her gift of sight, her religious faith and her place in the world as a woman.
In this book, as in The Other Boleyn Girl, it's the slow-building, passionate love story that touches me the most. The love story of Hannah and Daniel is very well-written and is my favorite part of the book. It is easy to see what draws them to each other and what keeps them apart. Though the road is bumpy, I was very pleased with the ending.
My only complaint would be that I thought the book ended a few pages too soon. (In fact, I would love to see a sequel about the next chapter in Hannah's life.) After everything Hannah went through to discover what she truly wanted, and after everything she went through to get it, I would have liked to see a more passionate ending and a little more assurance that Hannah's future would be as happy as I wanted it to be."
1501,"The Queen's Fool (The Plantagenet and Tudor Novels, #12)",0743246071,Philippa Gregory,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"I enjoy Philippa Gregory's books, but this book is relentlessly gloomy.  It was a perilous time for high and low, Catholic or Protestant by turns   but the heroine's thoughts never stray from the imminent possibility of death because she is a 'converted' Jew, although she gains a privileged position with both of Henry the VIII's daughters at court. Both Queen Mary and Princess Elizabeth dwell nearly every waking moment on the possibility they will be either overthrown and put to death or put to death for treason. Mary enjoys brief happiness on her marriage, soon dashed.  Elizabeth literally gets ill with fear again and again. Elizabeth was a brilliant woman,  judged to have the genius IQ her father, Henry, is also believed to have had.  Yet Gregory has Mary accuse her of being a bastard by a lute player, which has to be taken as Mary's hatred and paranoia.  Elizabeth had too many traits in common with her royal father for anyone to believe this was anything but a false accusation used to send Anne Boleyn to the block.  Gregory  portrayed Anne Boleyn as a raving shrew in THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL, with Katherine of Aragon rightly the victim she was. Anne Boleyn was calculating and selfish, but lost her head because she didn't bear Henry a son.  However, I see a pattern of soft-pedaling of the excesses of the old Catholic order and the Inquisition, while the Protestant monarchy that prevailed is denigrated by unpleasant accusations about Elizabeth, and there is inexcusable downplaying of Bloody Mary's campaign of mass murder of suspected Protestants by burning at the stake. Much blood was spilled before Mary, with priests and Catholics true to their faith masquerading and in hiding   but Elizabeth did not start burning Catholics when she took the throne. Calling her a callous seductress even at age 14, rather than seeing an awakening teenaged girl chased and perhaps seduced by Thomas Seymour, is ludicrous.  Supposedly she even swung her hips when she walked to seduce Mary's husband, Phillip. Who reported this, if any historical source? That doesn't play for me. It was a tightrope she walked, not instead her wicked nature to be a tease. She probably wasn't a virgin queen, only an unmarried one  but I think Gregory tries too hard to paint her as less sympathetic than Mary, when Mary was a woman almost addled on the subject of religion and devoid of conscience at what she did.  Not that a lot of people weren't then, and still are now--witness Northern Ireland and the Islamic terrorists who bomb innocents in the name of their religion. I have to confess much as I love historical fiction, and know religious fanaticism played a threatening role in that world, I am getting bored with characters who natter on about it all the time.  I disliked much about THE BIRTH OF VENUS by Sarah Dunant for this reason--I want a human story to dominate in a novel, not constant thoughts of saints or what is the correct route to heaven. Hannah Verde is the protagonist, yet she is dwarfed by the events portrayed  and there were contrived events that conveniently sent her back to England when she escaped that clunked in the plot.  This isn't like Philippa Gregory, not the writer I've admired."

I have too many feels right now. Review later.

*Edit*

Well, thinking it over didn't give me any better an idea of what to say about this. If I'm not mistaken, I was the exact same way after reading Daughter of Smoke &amp; Bone. Struck speechless. That is a feat of no mean proportions. I thought there was no possible way that Laini Taylor could follow up with anything even close to what she did to me with the first book. Apparently, when I am wrong, I am SPECTACULARLY wrong.

Reading this was a physical, visceral experience. I didn't just read it with my eyes, my whole body got in on the act. My blood, by turns, either froze or boiled. The hair stood up on my arms, gooseflesh crawled over my whole body, muscles locked down, my stomach dropped and rolled, and my heart clenched, squeezed and shattered. It was ridiculous, incredible, terrifying and fabulous.

In DoS&amp;B, Karou was a badass, true. But she still had an innocence to her, as with the blush of her first true love. That's all gone now. Burned away with all that became ash under her feet in Loramendi and all that's left tastes as bitter in her mouth as that ash would be. 

Now Karou has not only got to be tough, she has to be iron. Unbreakble. Even when she's terrified, or when her heart is in pieces. To me, that makes her even more of a badass than she was before.

Akiva, oh my God. He crushes me in this, so much. But no matter how devastated he is, he's determined to do what he promised he would. He's absolutely hopeless that he will ever be forgiven by Karou, but he never stops trying to make it right.

There are so many awesome characters. Mik &amp; Zuzana are so great in this, I love them. And Ziri, a Kirin like Madrigal, who crushed on her before she was executed. *sigh* I really love Ziri, but I can tell already that he is going to break my heart too, in a totally different way. Hazael and Liraz, Akiva's brother &amp; sister, are much more present in the story and you get a closer look at who they are, which is more than they appeared to be previously.

But this is war and it is brutal and harsh. Thiago, that snake, is every bit as savage as he was before and consumed even more by his desire to destroy the angels. *shivers* He's evil and scary as hell to read. This time though, Thiago isn't the only one plotting to spill blood. Jael, the commander of the angel Dominion forces is every bit as cruel and sly as Thiago, but he takes pleasure in being twisted. 

Ms. Taylor's writing here is just as lush, rich and spell-binding as everything I've read by her. But I'm not gonna lie, she is going to run your emotions through a wringer with this story. This is a truly amazing read and you can bet your ass I'll be first in line for the next one."

Brilliant storyline and conflict among characters. The brilliance continues in Days of Blood & Starlight. I couldnt put the book down once i started reading it. Karou and Akiva's battles with themselves and surroundings drew me into their world. I felt I was following them page after page. This book did not dissappoint, and i cant wait to read the third installment to these wonderful, creative books."
1503,Jitterbug Perfume,1842430351,Tom Robbins,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"this is one of those books that leaves your chest hurting and your head spinning. i didn't even realize how engrossed i was in it until it was a day later and i was almost done. the characters wouldn't let go of me, and i couldn't read anything else for weeks. i even absentmindedly called my friend Katie 'Kudra' once, and drew some weird looks. anyway, this book is just...magical. Priscilla is a wonderful mix of uncertainty and passion, nonchalance and love, while V'lu leaves you wondering, never really knowing where her loyalties lie. Alobar is the character i liked the most, because half the time you want to smack him and the other half you wanna give him a big hug. He's a naive king, and an optimistic cynic. He and Kudra's relationship evolves in front of your eyes, and that was what really impressed me, because not many writers can pull that off sucessfully. Ricki and Wiggs are the human aspects of the book, so obviously flawed, and Pan, of course, is the thing that ties them all together. That and the perfume. And beets, for a reason that i won't ruin for you. A must read for anyone, really."

I want to thank them for sending it to me. Receiving this book for free in no way influenced my opinion or review.




Blurb from Goodreads:
When Ruby woke up on her tenth birthday, something about her had changed. Something alarming enough to make her parents lock her in the garage and call the police. Something that gets her sent to Thurmond, a brutal government &ldquo;rehabilitation camp.&rdquo; She might have survived the mysterious disease that&rsquo;s killed most of America&rsquo;s children, but she and the others have emerged with something far worse: frightening abilities they cannot control.
Now sixteen, Ruby is one of the dangerous ones.
When the truth comes out, Ruby barely escapes Thurmond with her life. Now she&rsquo;s on the run, desperate to find the one safe haven left for kids like her&mdash;East River. She joins a group of kids who escaped their own camp. Liam, their brave leader, is falling hard for Ruby. But no matter how much she aches for him, Ruby can&rsquo;t risk getting close. Not after what happened to her parents.
When they arrive at East River, nothing is as it seems, least of all its mysterious leader. But there are other forces at work, people who will stop at nothing to use Ruby in their fight against the government. Ruby will be faced with a terrible choice, one that may mean giving up her only chance at a life worth living.




I'll start with the cover. Simple and to the point, I think. If you read the book, you'll completely understand the use of the Psi symbol on the cover. I like that the color scheme involves on two primary colors. And I really love how the symbol color makes it look like fire. The barbed wire around the bottom and top are perfect in conveying the message of the main characters really being trapped (which you'll understand more when you read the book as I don't want to spoil anything). I have a physical copy of this book and I love the feel of the cover. It's that soft paper. Job well done with the cover.




I really wasn't sure what to expect as far as the storyline was concerned. I knew it was kind of a dystopian type read, but I wasn't expecting the supernatural Xmen feel that this book gave. Since I love Xmen type stuff, this one was right up my ally. I love how the characters all have some type of power. I also love how the author chose to use a color system for character classification according to &quot;how dangerous&quot; they were: red being the most dangerous of all. Any story that involves people who are oppressed in some way by the government and choose to fight back is always a good read for me. With all the dystopian reads out there now, it's hard to find one that is different, and this certainly did the job for me. And the fun thing was you went into the story completely blind, without knowing the United States was slowly breaking down and without knowing why it was. And the author's world building is fun and different, giving the reader the opportunity to put the pieces together, rather than bore you with tons of explanations and descriptions.




Bracken's writing is crisp and clean. It flows and there are no awkward breaks or places to misunderstand what is going on. She unfolds details in subtle ways and allows the reader to work on building the puzzle within their own mind. She perfectly depicts the darkness and loneliness the characters are experiencing in a world that has pitted people against them for being different.




The characters are well thought out in this book.
I really love the main heroine, Ruby. I didn't find her to be too annoying with her teen angst and self-pitying as I do with other female main characters in YA books. No annoying whiny voice. She tells us her story and the stories of the other characters through her eyes. And she is as much a mystery to herself as she is to us. As she learns, we learn. As she grows, so do we. She is very relatable and certainly shows the innocence and naivet&eacute; of a character who has not been &quot;out in the world&quot; to learn.
Liam, well, he's sweet and good looking. Totally patient and unconditionally loving. He's nice to a fault and protective to his own detriment. He's funny and also mysterious. You can't help but fall for him. And watching him slowly fall for Ruby is great. He has a huge heart and is what you would certainly call one of the good boys.
Chubs and Zu are terrific supporting characters. Chubs is intelligent and a bit non-trusting. But he slowly grows to accept Ruby and it's great to watch their friendship blossom. And I love how Zu conveys all her thoughts through her actions, as she doesn't speak a word the entire book!
Clancy, well, I won't say much about it because it will give away the story. But I knew from the start he just was not what he was cracked up to be. And I could not bring myself to trust him at all.




One thing I loved about this book is that it did not revolve around the romance between the two characters. There is no insta-love, which is such a nice treat and far turn from so many other dystopians I have read recently. Sure, it was there, lingering until you are just about to explode if the characters don't give in to each other, but it's not the main theme. The main theme is focused on the character's experiences as they work their way through their powers and learn from each other along the way. And the pace is perfect, fast where it needs to be and slow where you would not expect it to be. And Bracken doesn't hold back on the heartbreak but does give you hope that at some point it will be mended.




If you enjoy books like The Hunger Games, Divergent, and Delirium, you will love The Darkest Minds. AS a matter of fact, this book reminded me of one of my favorite reads of the year, Shatter Me by Tahereh Mafi (although there is MUCH less romance in this book than Shatter Me).




I am really looking forward to the next book in this series. Thank you again to Disney for providing me with this totally awesome book! 5 out of 5 stars!"

1506,The Zahir,0060832819,"Paulo Coelho, Margaret Jull Costa",Barnes and Noble,3.7,Anonymous,"Beautiful, poetic, but earthy reality to non-traditional love that makes you wish this type of passion....of wanting....of willingness to put aside egos, everything we think is important, to find love within, despite tumultuous pasts, frayed upbringings, neural structures that just focus on the ""me""....oh, the point? That is real fairytale love.  The kind that will teach and you will want to learn, lest you go crazy in the not knowing. It even seems safe to say, if the love doesn't drive you a bit mad, it's probably not worth it. How far would you go, not just in distance, but in action...even if it is painful growth...for the one you love?"
1506,The Zahir,0060832819,"Paulo Coelho, Margaret Jull Costa",Barnes and Noble,3.7,MariaSavva_Author,"I hadn't read a Paulo Coelho book for a while and this book has reminded me what I love about his writing. I am definitely intending to read more of his work. I love the way the prose pulls you in and keeps you interested. There are many inspirational and spiritual passages in the novel which seem to be written with the intention of giving hope and direction to the reader.
The book is about an internationally acclaimed author whose wife has disappeared. She is a War correspondent and, therefore, the husband does not know whether she left him, or whether she was kidnapped or something far worse. One day a man appears at one of the author's book signings with a message from the wife to say that she is okay. The husband then becomes increasingly obsessed with idea of finding her. She becomes his 'Zahir' which is defined as something which, once seen or touched, can not be forgotten. We follow the husband in his journey to find his wife, and also in his own personal spiritual journey along the way.
It is described as a novel of 'obsession' and, in my view, Paulo has done a great job in writing the book in such a way that the reader has almost a compulsion to read on to find out what happens - almost as if the book becomes an obsession.
The book isn't perfect, so I can't give it five stars. I did find it a bit confusing in places, as there are often long conversations in the book between characters (sometimes multiple characters) without reference as to who is the speaker. Also, the lack of quotation marks at the beginning of new paragraphs when a character was making a speech or talking over a few paragraphs, was a bit annoying and also confusing.
Finally, I was quite disappointed with the ending; for me it was too predictable and a bit contrived.
But on the whole I enjoyed this book, and would definitely recommend it."

Reading Coehlo's book made it an imperative and the wall was created the very next day: I had to let people know about this book.  It's funny, thought -provoking and joyful to the soul in a way that is inexplicable (it touched me in ways I'm still trying to grasp).  And don't be fooled by the cover which says that the book is about obsession.  It is about love and freedom."
1507,The Power of Positive Thinking,1416560610,Norman Vincent Peale,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"It's such a simple and effective concept, that positive thinking creates a positive life, yet hard to do at times- which is a good reason alone to read this book. 

Most everything we accomplish each day starts out as a thought. Thoughts flash across our minds each day, all day long, and directly influence how we feel and what we do. So, if you spend your day thinking about negative things, expect to feel bad. On the other hand, if you spend your day concentrating on positive things, good things will happen. And that's basically the purposeand premise of this book- to change your thinking for the better, which in turn will influences your life. The book will ""reset your sights"" so to speak. 

Each chapter of the book tackles important life issues, such as worrying, creating happiness, having energy, etc. Examples of the principles abound, and each chapter ends with a nice summary. 

An inspiring and entertaining read, I recommend this book to anyone who needs a little nudge in the direction of positive thinking. Know though, that there is a definite religious tone throughout the book, which could bother some. Those looking for something a little more in the physical rather than cognitive realm to pick you up, might be better off with a book like ""Exercise Beats Depression""."

It's teachings and principles are as prudent today as when it was written - perhaps more so.  Each reading helps me to get a new and stronger perspective of how to, first, think, then live in accordance with ""nature's"" laws (or spiritual).  When the ""going gets tough"", I find it a book of much inspiration to keep my thinking up there and in positive, optimistic and overcoming framework.  This book is one of my reading ""staples"" and is always kept in front on my bookshelf for an uplift when needed.  Dr. Peale certainly understood the human person, our frailities - how life could be for us all and what it doesn't have to be, based on spiritual teachings - not religion.  A must read often."

My favorite kinds have always been the ones that have a lot of action, a solid plot, lovable characters with backstories that you never see coming, and humor. It's a lot to find, but I'm pleased to say that Fairy Tail is all of this and more. Set in the land of Fiore, we meet a man named Natsu, his pet cat, Happy, and a Stellar Spirit Mage, Lucy. Soon enough, we're introduced to the rest of the gang: Loke, a womanizer. Elfman, a strong individual who believes that all problems can be solved with his fists. Cana, a woman who is never far from a barrel of wine. And my personal favorite, Gray, an ice mage who has a habit of forgetting to put on clothes. These are just some of the characters in this amazing manga, and gradually, you are introduced to many more. But don't get me wrong, though each of these characters seem a bit. . . strange, each one has a story that will leave you in awe. I've been reading the online scans of Fairy Tail for over a year now. Take it from my experience: You won't ever be disappointed. I can't think of one chapter that I ever considered boring. Fairy Tail is the perfect blend of comedy, action, friendship, hope, suspense, and I'm pretty sure that you can see some hints of romance if you squint. ;) I'm so happy that Fairy Tail has been released in America, and I'm not going to hesitate to buy all the volumes.

Some will get it, many won't. Many will be confused, frustrated even, by the lack of plot, the lack of action, the lack of rationality, but I see it as a beautiful, quirky, incredibly sweet glimpse into one of the most interesting and mysterious characters in Pat's world.

As Vashet says in The Wise Man's Fear,
&ldquo;A story is like a nut. A fool will swallow it whole and choke. A fool will throw it away, thinking it of little worth. But a wise [person] finds a way to crack the shell and eat the meat inside.&quot;

1511,The Slow Regard of Silent Things (The Kingkiller Chronicle #2.5),0756410436,"Patrick Rothfuss, Nate  Taylor",Barnes and Noble,3.8,Halykan,"Just finished reading, and I want to say it was a delightful read.

Mostly I want to comment on Pat's authorial notes at the end (though I doubt he ever reads these reviews, I'm putting it out there): I'm glad he published it, even though he thought it wasn't a &quot;story&quot;. I think it's a great insight into Auri, and I just love her personality and the way she thinks of Kvothe. And it really just sets a tone and depth for her that I think I will appreciate even more on my zillionth re-read of the Kingkiller Chronicles.

So, thanks to Pat's publishers and Vi for convincing Pat to get this published. Sure, it's a very short story (and okay, a bit expensive for how short it is, but still worth), and sure, it's &quot;unusual&quot; but it's absolutely captivating and I loved it. I don't see how anyone who reads Rothfuss's books could NOT like it.

So if you're wondering whether it's worth the read, the answer is a resounding YES.

Side note: At least in the Nook version, it was hard to read in some places as the illustrations overlapped with the text. You can still make it out, but it can be difficult. As much as I liked the illustrations, I wish I could have turned them off while reading."
1512,Twelve Years a Slave,0000000000,Solomon Northup,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"First, I would like to address comments made in a previous review stating that it is unbelievable that a black man in 1853 would have the knowledge and ability to write such a book. Mr. Northup was a literate man and had the reviewer read the editor's notes at the beginning of the book, they would have known that Mr. Northup provided a narrative (spoken word) account of his story that the editor then compiled into this book. 

Secondly, the reviewer indicated that this book provided a very one sided view of slave masters; that being that they were all cruel. That is untrue. Mr. Northup mention the kindness of several slave owners. Unfortunately, for him, most of his servitude was spent under the ownership of a very violent and often, drunken master. He even stated that he could not speak to the nature of all slave owners, but was only conveying his own experiences.

To say one believes that the type of inhumane treatment of slaves portrayed in this book did not occur or was a rarity, is similar to people who refuse to believe the holocaust was a real event. While it is difficult for civilized people to imagine the inhumanity that was perpetrated upon slaves, it is a sad and horrific fact in our nation's history. To try to deny that mistreatment occured or was commonplace is the same blind eye mentality that allowed slavery to thrive in our nation. Regardless of the physical abuse suffered by those enslaved, the fact that they were stripped of their most basic rights to control their own destinies is a terrible mistreatment and injustice. And, in case one wonders, I am white and have lived most of my life in Texas, not in some northern, abolitionist state.

This book paints a very troubling, heart wrenching picture of the terrifying, exhausting life many slaves endured. The fact that they were able to survive such abuse is amazing. Until reading Mr. Northup's account of his kidnapping, I had no idea that such occurrences were fairly common to free men. His story is eye opening and haunting. I can't help but wonder what punishment was heaped upon the remaining slaves, especially Patsy, when Mr. Northup was removed from the plantation. This book is so compelling, I can see why someone felt moved to make a movie to share the story. The writing style and some of the language is somewhat archaic making for a slower read, but the story is worth the extra effort."

1513,"Lover Mine (Black Dagger Brotherhood, #8)",0451229851,J.R. Ward,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Velvet_068,"I finished reading the book last night. I've read all her books and I love her writing. I'm going to say I struggled a bit with this book, especially when I hit Chapter Nine. For the first time I felt lost. It just didn't flow as smoothly as she normally does, however I can see why she introduced this character and wrapped it up nicely at the end. It reminds me of how JR Ward claimed to struggle with Vicious book, yet I felt she struggled with this one. I think she wanted to set up for the next book, which towards the end I appreciated all the revelations. JR Ward should've focused more on Darius/John and down play Qhuinn and Blay, although I do look forward to their story. Every time JR Ward wrote about SC (those of you who have read it know who I'm talking about) I found myself asking why? That entire segment throughout the book made me want skip the pages so I can get back to John's story. I'm going to say that you do have to read it because it's key to the end. Overall I LOVED the book and look forward to the next one. Note to the Author, please try not to focus on so many characters. This book could've been you're best one to date had you not added new characters into the mix. By far my favorite's are Zadist, Viscious and now John minus SC storyline."
1513,"Lover Mine (Black Dagger Brotherhood, #8)",0451229851,J.R. Ward,Barnes and Noble,4.6,xMaybeTomorrow,"I discovered the Black Dagger Brotherhood series by accident and haven't looked back since! There have been books in the series where I haven't enjoyed them as much as the last or the one after. Everyone has their favourite brothers, even though I love them all, I do have my favorites.

And John Matthew is one of them, even though he's not technically a brother.

Lover Mine picks up where Lover Avenged left us. Xhex is still being held captive by the Omega's darling prodigal, Lash, and John Matthew is determined to bring her home. The only trouble is, since discovering his true heritage; Lash has been working on a few new taught tricks from daddy dearest.

Though John Matthew has never confessed his love for the half sympath Xhex, in his mind and in his heart she is his and even if she doesn't reciprocate those feelings. She will forever be his heart and soul.

When Lover Mine arrived in my post box I was stunned to see it sat at over five hundred pages. My first thoughts were, despite my overwhelming excitement, was how is this story supposed to stretch over that many pages/chapters? No sooner was I in a couple of pages; I couldn't stop turning them and cursed the page numbers as they increased.

Like in previous Novels, there was plenty going on that just John Matthew and Xhex's story. I don't want to go into too many details, as I don't want to give anything away. But there's enough going on between the main storyline that will keep you on the edge of your seat and turning pages all the way through.

Those looking for a story heavily involving the other Brothers, as they have been in past novels will be disappointed. Though they're there, they're background players in this novel (don't worry Rhage and Vichious get their licks in at one another). I missed the normal interaction between the brothers mostly their usual banter. But we had plenty of time to observe the workings of the newest additions to the Brotherhood compound, Quinn and Blay.

Final Thoughts.

If you're a fan of the Black Dagger Brotherhood series I really don't think you'll be disappointed. The Brotherhood is changing and expanding and looking back at the events of Dark Lover, they've come a long way. It's not until you look back at the past seven books that you realize the reality of the wealth of history and events that have taken place.

Unlike the other Brothers, and Rehvenge, John Matthew is the only character we've seen through from start to finish. With the other Brother's, they've already been through their transitions prior to the start of the books and have only seen glimpses of their pasts. But with John Matthew we've been with him through every step of the way since his first appearance in Lover Eternal.

It was nice to see John Matthew start to finally realize what was he was going through, in loosing Xhex, was none too dissimilar to what Torhment went through when he lost Wellsie. What John Matthew saw as selfish, and rejection from the one father figure he ever had, he came to realize was grief and anguish at loosing his shellan.

The great thing about Ward is that she has a fantastic gift of building subplot without distracting or taking anything away from the main story. By the end of the book I was wrapped up by in all the subplot she's building under noses and groaned in disbelief when I finally realized they would not be resolved until the next book!

I honestly, thoroughly enjoyed this book and think it makes an excellent"
1513,"Lover Mine (Black Dagger Brotherhood, #8)",0451229851,J.R. Ward,Barnes and Noble,4.6,SamanthaP,"**Spoiler Alert** Many Spoilers** 
I never thought J R Ward could out do Z's book and often referred to it as her masterpiece. That being said, this book was amazing and rivals Lover Awakened as my absolute favorite. There were about 5 plots going on at once but all things were relevant. She pulled elements from Darius' past that ran parallel to John and Xhex's current story. We get to see Darius and a very young Tohr working together, attempting to rescue a kidnapped rape victim. We all know that John is Darius reincarnated. That is so key to Johns current relationship with Tohr. John has never forgiven Tohr for abandoning him after Welsie's death. In his struggle to find Xhex he begins to truely understand how a bonded male is affected by the loss of a mate. We also finally get a glimpse of what it means for a bonded male to lose it. Let's just say the brutality is a ""OMG"" moment. 

John has always been one of my favorites after having watched him transition and grow. When Xhex rejects him in Lover Avenged, John becomes a drunk and a wh**e due to unrequited love. He redeems his character in the book. He returns to the loving, caring, put everyone's needs above my own John. Xhex had always been too masculine for my taste but as she recovers from the brutal rapes Lash has subjected her to, we see a much softer side. The love between John and Xhex is strengthened by John's ability to empathize having been a rape victim also. There is a little more Lash than I would have liked but that's because he is so evil. 

Blay is in love with Quinn but we find that there is so much more. Quinn suffers from feeling abnormal after being raised like a leper without love. The Glymera has him so messed up in the head that he is willing to let true love pass him by and attempt to live a lie. He also feels that Blay is a man of worth, that he is unworthy of Blays love. The love between these two is tangible and very passionate. Their relationship is further complicated by Saxton's, Quinn's cousin, pursuit of Blay. Blay and Quinn's story is gonna smoke if it's half as hot as their brief encounter in Lover Mine. 

We are introduced to a few new characters. I am very excited about the possibility of Tohr getting a HEA with ""No One"". It is very obvious that he did care for her deeply in the past. That previous connection may be what is needed to help him find love again. 

The next book Lover Unleashed is due out in Spring of 2011 and will feature Payne and Manny. V has just discovered that he has a twin sister only to have her fall for the one man he was about to kill in a jealous rage in Lover Unbound. That story should be a wild ride and I can't wait for more of the Brothers. 

JR Ward does skip around between about 5 different stories in this book. 1. Darius and Tohr (in the past) 2. John and Xhex 3. Blay and Quinn 4. Payne on the other side, and 5. The Paranormal tv show, which is kinda distracting until you see that they all come together in the end. A large portion of the plot doesn't come togther until the last 25 pages but it's worth the wait."
1514,In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex,0141001828,Nathaniel Philbrick,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"I hesitated in purchasing this book for a long time due to my expectation that a the majority of the story about sailors trapped at sea would get boring and I would loose interest based on may past reading experience.  I however, I have rad other Philbrick books including Sea of GLory so I took a chance.  Wow I am glad I did.  Philbrick has done it again.  I could not put the book down. What an amazing story and Philbrick's style once again is excellent.  My next read is The Last Stand and then Mayflower and after The Heart of the Sea I want to re-read Sea of Glory. I look forward to more great books from Philbrick."
1514,In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex,0141001828,Nathaniel Philbrick,Barnes and Noble,4.4,D_Steadman,"This book opens with an interesting preface which introduces the reader to the entire Nantucket whaling man's lifestyle. This encompassing view into the early 1800's handily sets the scene into the readers mind for the rest of the book. 

This book was written by Nathaniel Philbrick. As a resident of Nantucket island he has a personal viewpoint to write this story from. His book begins with the excitement of a young man going on his first whaling journey. The book quickly throws you into the story and never gives you a chance to pull yourself away. 

15 months into the journey of the Whaling ship Essex, during a routine whale hunting expedition the Essex was attacked by ""a great white whale"". Utterly destroying the ships bow and stranding the crew at sea. The 20 man crew was forced to travel in 3 small whaleboats in hopes of reaching shore. Being only 1500 miles away from the western islands, they decided to forgo that route in fear of cannibals. Instead they took the route to South America. A 3000 mile voyage in 3 25-foot boats with less than 2 weeks of very limited provisions. In the end Eight people survived, after being forced to the point of cannibalism to survive. 

The Essex was the most sensational story of its time. The story was larger then the story of the Titanic is today. This book brings back into the spotlight the tragedy that happened that fateful day and the sheer bravery of the men who persevered and survived the gruesome ordeal fate threw them into. This book also ends with explanations of the whaling lore and the effect this event had on American Literature, the largest of which is the Basis for the great American novel Moby Dick.

I would greatly recommend this book to anyone interested in whaling lore or the whaleship Essex. I was given this book as a gift from my cousin with no previous knowledge of the event and I can honestly say it was a struggle to put it down. Philbrick spins a fantastic story and draws you into the scene to where you can almost smell the sea breeze blowing over your face."
1514,In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex,0141001828,Nathaniel Philbrick,Barnes and Noble,4.4,cmp53,"As a fan of history, this was an event that I honestly can admit I didn't know much about so I thought I would read the book. This is a well written, thoroughly gripping book that makes you appreciate what our forefathers went thru to earn a living. A great book that you will not be able to put down."
1515,Infidel,0743289684,Ayaan Hirsi Ali,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"For an autobiography this book is amazingly readable. I could not put it down even though I knew how it ended. Ali writes beautifully and gives such stark descriptions of life as a woman in a third world Muslim family.

Most important was the insight she gave into her transformation  from a faithful Islam believer to an agnostic. Her explanations of her early instruction in Islam, all the prohibitions, her beginning doubts, (ie men didn't crash cars in Holland by being distracted by women in modern dress) her eventual rejection of Islam help to make the current political climate clearer. 

I am not certain I can agree with her conclusion not to trust any Muslim, but I can understand that with her life threatened why she must feel that way.

I constantly had to remind myself that she is just 42. She is so strong, courageous and has accomplished so much."
1515,Infidel,0743289684,Ayaan Hirsi Ali,Barnes and Noble,4.2,MadmanMatt,"The author puts to rest the false impression that Islam stands for peaceful solutuions in solving the differences of the world's religions; that it is a religion that stands for toleration.  She stands up for women's rights denied in the world in which she had been born and from which she had escaped.  Forced marriages of young girls to older men, female genital mutilation, second class citizenship for women in the Muslim world:  battles against these abuses are the ones she has chosen to fight, perilous to her life."
1515,Infidel,0743289684,Ayaan Hirsi Ali,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"I have read several reviews left by those who are most likely Muslims and the Muslims who are leaving the reviews are most likely American Muslims. I have read some of the Quran before and it contradicts itself. I know how it is in Muslim countries and they claim that everything they do, killing their wife or daughter for disobedience, or blowing up an orthodox church, they claim all that in the name of the Quran and in the name of Allah. Do not tell me that Islam is all love. I have experienced several times how they treat others when it comes to religion. I know a girl personally who converted from that religion. I am NOT sying that all Muslims are hating extremists, but look at the mid-east and tell me that a vast majority aren't. This book gives an accurate truth of Islam."
1516,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,1400063515,Nassim Nicholas Taleb,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Jim-McInvale,"Just as the negative space gives form to the objective in a work of art, so the unknown gives relevance to knowledge. In The Black Swan, Taleb shows that all human knowledge is but a collection of crude marks on a vast canvas of ignorance. We know much less than we think we know, and understand even that poorly. Further, our history, both personal and collective, is governed by events that we did not predict, could not have predicted, and really do not comprehend.

Taleb defines the black swan concept as an event with three characteristics: unpredictability, extreme impact, and (unfortunately) the power to inspire us to contrive ex post facto explanations. For much of history conventional wisdom held that all swans were white. When Europeans colonized Australia and found black swans, however, an entire body of knowledge was upended. That is a key concept. Some events out there will obliterate all prior understanding. These events reside in a province Taleb dubs ""Extremistan."" 

Despite our blindness to high-impact black swan events, we always go back and contrive explanations that would have predicted those events. Narrative fallacy is a term the author uses to describe how we fit facts to a preconceived story. After the dust settles, we tell ourselves that we are smarter now, and wait for the next Black Swan, drunk with the false belief that we understand the risk and are somehow protected from it.

Taleb describes several other mental traps. Epistemic arrogance is a term he uses to tell us that we are not nearly as smart as we think, and confirmation error is the tendency to look for instances that confirm our beliefs. It is our nature to connect random facts, weave a story, and then force fit this crude mental model onto physical reality. We do this not only to make future predictions, but also to interpret the past. Causal stories we contrive to make historic events appear deterministic are in fact just a cherry picking of facts to fit a story. We can't even predict history well. The author cautions us to be very wary of any human explanations: he makes a strong argument that we should avoid making strong arguments.

Despite the shortcomings of our primitive mental processors, the situation is not entirely as hopeless. Though we can know little of the events that most impact our lives, we can profit from the delusion of others. Financial markets are driven by a great many people that underestimate the impact and likelihood of Black Swan events. We can profit by betting on long shots, doing it a lot, but placing only small bets. That way, the losses will be bounded and you never suffer from catastrophic black swan events. Taleb cashed in this strategy, and retired to pursue his passion for philosophy.

When someone writes with intensity and honesty, the reader invariably gets a sense of the writer's personality. So it is with Taleb. He is a brilliant and unconventional thinker with little respect for established and institutionalized knowledge. Platonified (compartmentalized) thinking incenses him and he despises the high priests of academia - the ministers of what Robert Pirsig called ""The Church of Reason"". Taleb disdains their sacraments (especially the Gaussian curve) and their holiest institutions (e.g. the Nobel Prize.) I went through most of the book believing the writer a man of very strong opinions, only to realize at the end that I was, of course, wrong.  Nassim Nicholas Taleb is a man of extreme opinions."
1516,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,1400063515,Nassim Nicholas Taleb,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,"Easy enough to understand but rarely used in practice... Taleb's overwhelming point in this entertaining book is simple... 'Keep your eyes wide open'. Through his anecdotal reasoning Taleb illustrates case after case and historical reference after historical reference with a unique narrative style that is slightly fragmented yet nearly as entertaining as what you might expect from a work of fiction often leaving the reader with a discernable smile while mumbling to himself: 'Hmmm... You know this guy's got a point!¿ With an impressive understanding of the human social condition and our psychological tendencies, Taleb lays good claim to how we fail to anticipate, react to and make sense of the random events that have the greatest impact on our lives. In the end Taleb offers no specific solution or process by which one can profit or gain from the unexpected... however, the reader invariably learns the value of 'skepticism' and can easily see how this primarily philosophical dogma can be applicable to real life and of course, the financial markets! The Black Swan does more to re-align one's perspective than anything else, but few books do as good a job in this regard."
1516,The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable,1400063515,Nassim Nicholas Taleb,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,"According to critic Harold Bloom, Hamlet's predicament is not 'that he thinks too much' but rather that 'he thinks too well,' being ultimately 'unable to rest in illusions of any kind.' The same could be said for philosopher, essayist and trader Nassim Nicholas Taleb, who finds something rotten in misguided yet supremely confident investment gurus, traders, hedge fund managers, Wall Street bankers, M.B.A.s, CEOs, Nobel-winning economists and others who claim that they can predict the future and explain the past. Like everyone else, says Taleb, these so-called 'experts' fail to appreciate 'black swans': highly consequential but unlikely events that render predictions and standard explanations worse than worthless. Taleb's style is personal and literary, but his heterodox insights are rigorous (if sometimes jolted by authorial filigree). This combination makes for a thrilling, disturbing, contentious and unforgettable book on chance and randomness. While Taleb offers strong medicine some readers may find too bitter at times, we prescribe it to anyone who wants a powerful inoculation against gullibility."
1517,"The Twelve (The Passage, #2)",0345504984,Justin Cronin,Barnes and Noble,4.2,kimba88,"The Twelve begins with a clever prologue. It was delivered much like scriptures and recaps the events from the Passage. This quickly reacquainted me to the world and the characters. As I read I imagined the Omen theme song in my head. The twelve are the original men turned viral when a military experiment ""Project Noah"" went wrong. They are linked and the parents of all the Virals created. Five years have passed since Amy and her small team defeated Babcock. In this novel Cronin skillfully takes us from year zero to 97 A.V,-five years after book one ended. He masterfully fills in details and introducing new characters. The tale that unfolded sent shivers down my spine as I became fully immersed in the world Cronin created. The characters in this trilogy have been superbly fleshed out. Amy while still a mystery evolves in this second novel. Peter is at a crossroads and is perhaps my favorite character. The underlying connection between them captured my heart. We reconnect with Lila, Wolfgast's ex-wife. She is fractured, unique and has a significant role in book two. Grey who was a sweeper in book one, is back and attempts to change his life. Greer is imprisoned and becomes a seer. Guilder is a new character and straight from your worst nightmare. I still shiver thinking about him and what he is capable of. All of the key characters are reintroduced and become more fleshed out, as we go from past to present. We get a closer look and understanding of the Virals, otherwise known as Dracs, Glowsticks, Jumps, Dopeys, Smokes and Flyers. We begin to understand their hierarchy and what has become of their humanity. Then there is the twelve and there leader Zero. I can hear them in my head, ""I am Morrison-Chavez-Baffles-Turrell-Winston-Sosa-Echolos-Lambright-Martinez-Reinhardt-Carter."" ""Come to me."" *shivers* There is a very helpful guide in the back of the book that lists all of the characters and briefly describes them. The world Cronin has created is horrifying, unimaginable and yet I believed. Cronin is in complete control of this masterpiece and I was spellbound. Not since Stephen King's The Stand have I been so blown away. While the tale doesn't move in a linear fashion he skillfully takes us from past, present to future giving me a 3-D panoramic view of the world. It is quite clear he knows the terrain of the Midwest and with his pen; he brought its vast grasslands to life. He has crafted a tale, which completely enthralled me. It also scared the crap out of me. It made me question the human mind, scientific advancements and mans quest for power. How would we survive this world? It also inspired me, and gave me hope as humankind survived, adapted and never surrendered. The Homeland and all that it stood for frightened me more than the Virals. I could not wrap myself around the horrors Guilder had created. This tale ended on a slightly high note, and felt complete. Cronin left us with the knowledge that a new battle would begin soon...Eep! I cannot wait. Flyers! I really feel like my review does not even begin to give The Twelve and author the praise it deserves. Cronin is pure genius and I would love to have a coffee and a conversation with him. I honestly think, he sees the characters in his mind and knows exactly what they are doing, even when they are not present within the pages he is writing. He blurs the lines of reality, bringing this post-apocalyptic nightmare to life. If you know me, you kno"

I've been up two days straight reading it.  I think this author is a brilliant writer.  There are authors who are good story tellers, and there are authors who are good writers.....and then there is the rare combination of authors who are both.  Justin Cronin falls into that rare category.  I definitely reccommend this book to anyone who loves to read.

It has action, adventure, sci-fi, fantasy, realism, and even a little romance, all rolled in between the covers of this book. :)"

I actually liked it a bit better than The Passage.  While I also loved the Passage, it was a bit slow from time ot time.  I guess that's to be expected in a book that's almost 900 pages long.  I never thought The Twelve was slow at any point.  There was a lot more action and the original characters was developed even more.  Overall, I loved it and can't wait for the last installment."
1518,One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich,0374529523,"Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, H.T. Willetts",Barnes and Noble,3.8,shadowofthewind on LibraryThing,"A fictional account of life in a Soviet Gulag, this story is a good example of how you can adjust your expectations, even in the worst of situations. Ivan Denisovich was sent to the work camps because he confessed to being a spy. He had no other choice than to confess, otherwise, he would be likely executed. All he really did was fight on the Russian Eastern front against the Nazis, get captured during a battle, and then escape. When he returned to his own lines, he was accused of being a spy and had to confess or face execution. This story was not unusual in Soviet Russia. People were imprisoned for no reason and sent to horrific work camps. As Russia was pushing the Nazis back from Eastern Europe, many who were in Nazi work camps, were sent to Siberia to work in Russian work camps. This was a reality many faced and why this book was extremely popular in the Soviet Union when it was published in 1962. Some good passages:""How can you expect a man who's warm to understand a man who's cold?"" P19""Who's the zen's main enemy? Another zen. If only they weren't at odds with one another--ah what a difference they'd make. 71There in the line Shukhov learned some news. Again there wasn't going to be a Sunday this week; again they were going to steal one of their Sundays. He, like everyone else, had expected it, for if there happened to be five Sundays in a month, they gave them three and made them work the other two. 75""""He dug in. First he only drank the broth, drank and drank. As it went down, filling his whole body with warmth, all his guts began to flutter at him at their meeting with that stew. Goood! There it comes a brief moment for which a zen lives. And now Shukhov complained about nothing: neither about the length of his stretch, nor about the length of the day, nor about them swiping another Sunday. This is all he thought about now; we'll survive. We'll stick it out God willing till it's over p 81""""Shukhov went to sleep fully content. He'd had many strokes of luck that day: they hadn't put him in the cells; they hadn't sent his squad to the settlement; he'd swiped a bowl of kasha at dinner; the squad leader had fixed the rates well; he'd built a wall and enjoyed doing it; he'd smuggled that bit of hacksaw blade through; he'd earned a favor from Tsezar that evening; he'd bought that tobacco. And he hadn't fallen ill. He'd got over it. A day without a dark cloud. Almost a happy day. There were three thousand six hundred and fiftythree days like that in his stretch. From the first clang of the rail to the last clang of the rail. Three thousand six hundred and fifty-three days. The three extra days were for leap years. (last lines)"
1518,One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich,0374529523,"Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, H.T. Willetts",Barnes and Noble,3.8,rburdock on LibraryThing,"Set in a post-war Stalinist labour camp, this novel, as the title suggests, centres on a single day in the life of `political prisoner¿ Ivan Denisovich, from (before) sunrise to (well after) sunset. As one might imagine, Ivan has little to look forward to on this `typical¿ day in the camp; ultra sub-zero temperatures, horrendous food, forced labour, and incessantly picky guards all await him, and his fellow inmates. As harrowing as the day is though, this day actually turns out to be one of the `better¿ ones, which although bringing a little cheer to Ivan, leaves the reader puzzling (and more than a little shocked), over what must constitute a `bad¿ day in one of these places.Comprising of a mere 143 pages, I finished reading this classic rather speedily, although perhaps not as `speedily¿ as I would have, if I were reading a novel that originated in English. As a qualified historian I¿m wholly familiar with clumsy translations, and sadly this translated novel is no different. So if you¿re planning on reading this yourself, then be prepared to re-read a number of the sentences, in order to fully decipher their full meaning. Don¿t let that put you off though (or from reading any translated Russian literature for that matter), as the minor hindrance caused by having to pause and re-read, is completed negated by the quality of this work.Along with other works that he penned during the 1960¿s, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn got himself into a lot of bother from the Soviet authorities for writing this novel, and after reading it, it¿s clear to see why. Aided by more than a liberal dose of anti-Stalinist sentimentality, Mr. Solzhenitsyn pulls no punches in describing the conditions in Soviet labour camps. Given that he himself spent eight years in these camps, after the war, this is no surprise, but because Mr. Solzhenitsyn was able to infuse his own experiences into this novel, One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich is an absolute `must read¿ - just don¿t expect to leave your chair in anything like a cheery mood.   Favourite quote: ¿There is nothing as bitter as this moment when you go out to the morning muster - in the dark, in the cold, with a hungry belly, to face a whole day of work. You lose your tongue. You lose all desire to speak to anyone.¿Favourite scene: Breakfast in the mess-hall. The description of what the prisoners ate and how they ate it is gross to the max. Very memorable and hugely powerful!!What this novel has taught me about writing: Life experience can enrich a novelist's work immeasurably. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn spent 8 years interned in Russian labour camps (followed by 3 more in exile) and this is clearly evident in the detail of this novel, and the depth of emotion it contains. Perhaps this advocates, although not exclusively, a policy of choosing a subject to write about that you have personal experience and knowledge of."

Willetts",Barnes and Noble,3.8,JoK on LibraryThing,"Fellow reviewers have spoken at length about the accuracy and historical relevance of the portrayal of the Soviet Gulag system in _One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich_. They have detailed the harsh conditions, the complex mechanics of survival in the Gulag, the terror of Stalin's government, and the 'harrowing' experiences of the zeks - the slang term for the Soviet Gulag prisoner. I concur with all of these observations, but I would like to provide the potential reader with a view from another angle._One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich_ is uplifting. It is a story of the transcendent quality of the human will that allows one not only to survive, but to _live_ in the most adverse of situations. The protagonist, Shukhov, shows little fear, little pain. Instead he shows that a slave laborer can retain enough dignity to show pride in his workmanship, compassion for his fellows, and a drive to carry on.Throughout the story Shukhov is creating. He sews, builds a wall, fashions illicit tools. And though these things help ensure his survival, his ongoing occupation in these activities and his investment of himself in them shows what a basic part of humans the creative impulse is. For Shukhov, creating does not save his life, it is his life.In this world, there are people whose words are clear and inspiring, tempered with insight gained through adversity - the kind of adversity so severe that no person would choose to place themselves amongst it. Imprisonment, danger, fear of death. Solzhenitsyn is one of these; the wisdom he offers to us has already been bought and paid for. We others are fortunate enough to be lent what these people have to offer - those who have had no choice but to be there, and have lived to write about it. And if ever we find ourselves in a similar kind of adversity, we can remember what they have taught us, and know that adversity can be endured.Some say that life is suffering. The story of the zek shows me in suffering, there can be life. The story reminded me of how comfortable my life is and how trivial my concerns can be. The author's style and the skill of the translation (I refer to the H.T. Willetts translation, ISBN 0374521956) make this book accessible to everyone. This is fortunate, because everyone can benefit from the message to be found in _One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich_."

1519,"The Diamond Age: or, A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer",0553380966,Neal Stephenson,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"This book made me realize the benefits of education.  Nell is no one, she is poor, crude, and is really going nowhere.  However once her brother Harvey steals the Primer from Hackworth, he gives it to Nell and her journey begins.  The book starts by teaching her the basics.  She cannot read, so it reads to her.  It teaches her defensive tactics so she can keep the book.  It teaches her what exactly is sexual abuse, so that she stays healthy.  This is only the beginning, though.  As she gets older, the lessons become less about 'reading, writing, and arithmetic', and more philosophical, moral, and ethical.  She learns about people and why they leave, and how that can be better in the end.  She learns about trust, and how important it is to trust the right people.        Two other little girls have their own copies of the Primer, and it gives them lessons that are tailored to them.  To Fiona, Hackworth's daughter, it teaches her magical stories and new realms of thought. It develops her imagination, because that is what she is interested in developing.   In the end, she becomes an actress. For Elizabeth, a granddaughter of a prominent man, the book creates a world where she is the ruler.  She learns about the idea of loyalty and obedience.  She later joins another group, an information cult called the CryptNet.          There is another difference in their education.  Elizabeth was taught by hundreds of different people.  She became disillusioned by what she learned, and went off to find another group.  Mainly her father, who is a strict Victorian in principle, but who has the soul of a dreamer, taught Fiona.  In the Primer, he was only the dreamer so Fiona became a dreamer.  And this translated to acting for her.  One woman, an actor named Miranda, taught Nell.  Early on, Miranda realized that she was raising someone's child, and she took it seriously.  She gave up a lot of things to be there for Nell.  Because of this, Nell grew up the most intelligent of the three.  She grew up and took her place in history, which was to destroy existing society and change the world.       I have really enjoyed this book.  I read it the first time when I was in high school, and I loved it.  I just reread it for this review, and I still love it for different reasons.  I like the message that education, while incredibly valuable, will only take a person so far.  After that, their cunning, morals, and ideas must take them the right way.  Elizabeth reminded me of children who are raised by schools and universities.  They are taught by lots of different people who don't really know them.  Those types of students become disillusioned and rebel.  Fiona shows what happens when there is no balance; she was taught only fantasy and so she immersed herself in it.  Nell had balance; her individual story had an overall fairy-tale theme, but it was filled with martial arts, logic games, and moral/ethical lessons.  She also had a mother figure, someone who cared for her, at least intellectually.  I liked the idea of all the different societies trying to exist.  I can see after all the moral corruption, a group of people going back to the Victorian ways.  Overall, this book is believable as our future, and it is a future I would not mind having."

Here's my 2 cents...  If you want a fast paced, Hollywood movie type of book then Snow Crash is for you.  If you're looking for a science fiction work that takes a crack at examining the possible consequences of upcoming technologies, give DA a whirl.  Both books are a good read, but DA is the one that sticks in my mind.   BTW, if you're looking to match your taste to mine, I thought Cryptonomicon was only so-so."

707,Walk Two Moons,0060739495,Sharon Creech,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"This was a book that I totally judged by the cover at first, thinking it was boring. I was so mistaken. Walk Two Moons is a great book that everybody should take the opportunity to read, no matter your age. It's cute, and funny, and very enjoyable. I read this book in the 5th grade, and today, as I graduate from high school, it is still one of my favorite books."
707,Walk Two Moons,0060739495,Sharon Creech,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"Are you a crazy, spontaneous person?  Do your friends complain about how random you are?  Do you have trouble focusing on one thing for a long time?  If you answered yes to any of these questions, then Walk Two Moons by Sharon Creech is the book for you.  This is a story about a girl named Salamanca Hiddle, or Sal for short.  She is coping with many problems.  She is a farm girl who is moving to the city.  Her mother left the family for Lewiston, Idaho without saying why.  Sal and her father want her to come back very badly.  Sal decides to go on a road trip with her grandparents to Idaho to see her mother.  She tells a story to pass the time.  It's about a girl named Phoebe Winterbottom.  As the story goes on, it sounds very similar to Sal's life.  Meanwhile, Gram and Gramps get into all kinds of silly trouble.  Gramps tries to fix a woman's car and ends up disassembling the engine. The gang goes to a river and Gram is bitten by a snake.  They stop at many historical sights along the way.  This story is very random if you couldn't tell.  I would recomend this book to everyone.  It is different than other books.  It manages to intertwine two stories and show the similarities between them.  The book also throws in some interesting Native American quotes about life.  It manages to put laughter and fun along with sadness and tragedy.  Walk Two Moons is a book that you should check out."

708,Eleven Minutes,0060589280,"Paulo Coelho, Margaret Jull Costa",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"I really enjoyed this book.  It really puts a different outlook on sex and love, and it makes you step back and think about not only the story but also your own life.  A must read!!!"
708,Eleven Minutes,0060589280,"Paulo Coelho, Margaret Jull Costa",Barnes and Noble,4.2,C-Castillo,"This is my first book by Paulo Coelho and I've become in love with his writing after reading ""Eleven Minutes"" Its a great story with a broader meaning , at least thats what I got from it. It has changed my outlook on life and in certain aspects I can relate to Maria. I would definitely reccommend this book to others."
708,Eleven Minutes,0060589280,"Paulo Coelho, Margaret Jull Costa",Barnes and Noble,4.2,valvintage,We always have questions about love and sex and sometimes forget to give ourselves a chance. This novel takes romance out of love and makes it even more meaningful. It is about personal aspirations and finding true love getting there.
709,Nine Stories,0316767727,J.D. Salinger,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"This book is amazing. Especially how jd salinger incorporates all the buddhist themes in it.  Thats not the only thing that makes this book great though, its the familiarity of it all.  When I read any of J.d Salinger's stories I feel like Im having de ja vu or something.  The name nine stories also relates to the saying that cats have nine lives.  If anyone is familiar with the Glass family, Seymore brings up the fact that he would like to be a dead cat.  (Relates to reincarnation too).  He's a genius and i recommend this book to anyone who's willing to take a closer look."
709,Nine Stories,0316767727,J.D. Salinger,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"i really like nine stories, but i dont think i understood the deeper meanings. I loved A Perfect Day For Bananafish and Teddy. Everyone should read it, because its good stuff."
709,Nine Stories,0316767727,J.D. Salinger,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Humxm,"This may be the best collection of short stories ever written--and I have read many collections.  While not everyone will understand all the stories on a first reading, each story will become more and more clear upon additional readings.  In fact, that is one mark of good writing: Is it an onion?--i.e., can it be read again (and again) revealing layers of meaning and insight.  Salinger's Nine Stories are full of layers and real people.  Both the stories and the people will become unforgettable.  A masterpiece."
710,"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her Sanity to Master the Art of Living",031610969X,Julie Powell,Barnes and Noble,3.2,ajt4,"I was excited to read this book.  What an amazing thing to take on in one year.  Cooking some of the hardest receipes out there by the great Julia Child.  I was excited to hear about how she figured it out all from a cookbook and no help.  

Instead - this was a self-indulgent look into a womans life that as I read further, I realized I didn't like.  Don't get me wrong - I don't care about the bad language.  I'm not giving this a bad rating over that.  

I found the writing to be disjointed, the story did not flow and I didn't laugh.  There were three major problems I had with the book.  

1.  The gross factor - I'm not talking about cooking livers or kidneys or brains.  I'm refering to the filth she lived in and cooked in.  When your kitchen is so disgusting that your sinks are backing up, your house is full of flies and you have a mass of maggots in your dish tray - the last thing you should be doing is cooking.  

2.  The political bashing.  While I appreciate everyone is entitled to their opinion, I don't think it belongs in a 'non-political' book.  If I want to hear the bashing - I'll turn on the news or read a political book.  In a book about cooking and life - there is no reason to continually go off on your political ramblings.  The criticism and the stereotyping of one group was just not needed in the book.  Each time this happened, I considered throwing the book out.  

3.  Julie as a person.  At the end of the day - I thought I might grow to like her.  She was self-centered, lazy, dirty and contributed nothing.  At the end of the book - she seemed even more self-centered, I didn't get a big message out of all of this so either she can't write or she didn't either and her contribution was a blog and a poorly written book.  Even Julia Child didn't like her.  If I were Julia Child - I wouldn't want this woman anywhere near anything I had done. Much less attach her name to mine.  

Such a shame as this could have been so much better. 

This book reminded me a lot of Eat, Pray, Love. Another book about a self-absorbed woman that was almost impossible to finish."
710,"Julie and Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen: How One Girl Risked Her Marriage, Her Job, and Her Sanity to Master the Art of Living",031610969X,Julie Powell,Barnes and Noble,3.2,Guest,"From my perspective, Julie Powell's life wasn't worth the reading time it took out of my life.  I found the book title and premise misleading, since the work shared few cooking experiences and any relationship to Julia Child  was tangential, at best. While the author did use Child's recipes, she also had what I consider the audacity to 'make up' other material regarding the lives of Julia and Paul Child, which, even if 'inspired' by original material and acknowledged in the author's note, seems an obvious ploy at aligning her life with theirs. Anyone interested in the interesting and impressive life of the remarkable woman who was Julia Child would be better served by reading her own work,written with her grandnephew, Alex Prud'homme, 'My Life in France'. Quite frankly, Powell could have been using any cookbook for her excuse to write a blog, and then later a book, except it is clear that by associating her self with Child she seeks a status that is undeserved.      I rarely stop reading a book, but in this case I made an exception."

If I met this woman in person, I wouldn't like her!  I'm voting with my pocketbook and returning the book for a refund.  Do yourself a favor, and don't buy it in the first place.  This snarky style of witticism isn't for me."
711,"Unwind (Unwind, #1)",1416912045,Neal Shusterman,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"Imagine life in the future. The Second Civil War, also known as ¿The Heartland War¿ has been fought and eventually resolved by certain constitutional amendments known as ¿The Bill of Life.¿ So while human life may not be touched from conception until the age of thirteen, a child may be retroactively aborted between the ages of thirteen and eighteen. This process, known as ¿unwinding¿ doesn¿t technically end life, but separates all the body parts to be used for medical transplants. In this futuristic society, unwinding alters the meaning of life.    Unwinding is the fate set for three teens that meet by chance. Connor has always been a troublemaker, and his parents have finally had enough. Risa is a ward of the state, and budget cuts have forced Risa into this situation. Lev is the only one of the three who doesn¿t see unwinding as a terrible thing  rather, as a tithe, he accepts that being unwound is his purpose in life. In a deadly car crash, these teens escape the fate that awaits them at harvest camps and flee for their lives (although Lev is more of a kidnappee). In this incredible and thought-provoking novel, Neal Shusterman questions what it means to be human and the value of life.    Unwind may see like just a unique action novel, but it is so much more. The desperation, danger, and running-for-your-life sequences may thrill the action lover, but the story is more profound than that. It was actually quite difficult for me to read this novel because of the horrible atrocity called unwinding. Half the time, I couldn¿t even believe how inhuman some of the characters were to commit these morally wrong acts. What relieved me, though, was that for every bad thing, there was something good  the random acts of kindness strangers performed for the fugitives sometimes brought tears to my eyes. This novel revolves around the controversial topic of the pro-life/pro-choice debate, because it focuses on the sacredness of life. However, Shusterman does not take the topic from a religious or scientific perspective, but bases this book around moral everyone should have: everyone deserves the right to live and not just in the scientific sense that all your body parts are functioning, but living as a whole. All this was channeled into the lives of runaways who were slated to be unwound in this unforgettable story.    I can¿t really explain how amazing this novel was  you¿ll just have to read it for yourself to understand. Just know that although most of the novel was pretty depressing, the story ends on a hopeful note. Fans of The Host by Stephenie Meyer, the Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld, and Life as We Knew It by Susan Beth Pfeffer will also enjoy this novel."
711,"Unwind (Unwind, #1)",1416912045,Neal Shusterman,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,"some people might find the plot to be a bit disturbing but i really liked how neal shusterman weaved the story together and made it all flow, unlike most nowaday authors who seem to drag forever!! and kind of lose the flow of the story, but in Unwind every single information has a significance and the book is very fast paced, everything happens so much in just 300+ pages...  READ IT!"
711,"Unwind (Unwind, #1)",1416912045,Neal Shusterman,Barnes and Noble,4.5,mnblack,"I dont think I expected much out of this book when I bought it. Buy it. Right now. This is a book for all ages, and I highly encourage everyone to read it. It's a tale of dispair, anger, and unlikely friends as well as enemies entertwining. It metamorphasizes into an epic journey of strength, courage, and hope. I don't believe I will find a more wonderful and truly touching book in the span of my lifetime."
712,"Drums of Autumn (Outlander, #4)",0385335989,Diana Gabaldon,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"Since I started reading this series, I have been compelled to continue even if I wasn't in the mood for Gabaldon's books. This book was definitely different than the first three. I enjoyed ""The Outlander"" but the next two books were quite a struggle for me to get through. I consciously decided to take my time on Drums of Autumn to ensure that I didn't confuse characters and muddle up story lines. In fact, it took me 6 months to read this book, and I really, really enjoyed it. The smaller stories within the book were so riveting this time. For the first time since starting this series, I am chomping at the bit to start the next book.

The only reason I gave this one four stars instead of five was the length of this book. I would have felt satisfied finishing about 3/4 of the way through. But otherwise, it was a great read."
712,"Drums of Autumn (Outlander, #4)",0385335989,Diana Gabaldon,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"I have just completed Drums of Autumn. Although it is long the only thing that was annoying for me was the overly long drawn out descriptions of some of the events especially when it came to Roger. It was too drawn out. I have started on the next book and that one repeats quite a few pages from this book before finally starting out. I hope its worth it, I would like to continue enjoying these books."
712,"Drums of Autumn (Outlander, #4)",0385335989,Diana Gabaldon,Barnes and Noble,4.6,madison-dixon,"Loved the first one could not put it down, I have read most of her books and I must say each new book seems to go on and on and on more and more! cut to the chase! it would make for better reading...."
713,"Prodigy (Legend, #2)",0399256768,Marie Lu,Barnes and Noble,4.5,majibookshelf,"Prodigy exceeded my expectations by a mile. We all know the middle book syndrome but Marie Lu managed to avoid that pit. Prodigy wasn't just good, it was spectacularly written, the plot was crafty, and so much better than Legend. Prodigy had its own main plot and it didn't aimlessly go on like some middle books. The stakes are so much higher here; we have an assassination plot, finding people, trying to start a revolution against the Republics, and a lot of backstabbing. What is surprising was alliances were formed that we wouldn't have expected, not in a million years.Prodigy is also told from both Day and June's POV. Don't go thinking there is much romance and a love triangle or square, because throughout the book, the romance was insignificant to me in comparison to the big plans going on. Yes, there is progression in the romance, some heartbreaks and a horrible cliffhanger, but for the most part Marie Lu stuck to the true meaning of the dystopian genre. I loved that Day and June spent a big portion of the novel apart because this way Lu was able to cover a big portion of the plot and more action.The direction of the plot that Lu took hooked me. The assassination plot allowed the whole book to progress in a way that kept the readers excited as well as allowed her to give us hints and here and there and create a few subplots, such as the relationship between Day and Tess. I also loved how Day and June have become &quot;celebrities&quot; in the eyes of the population and how Marie Lu used the whole revolutionary theme to free America in Prodigy.In terms of the characters, I found Day to be a tiny bit to be easily mistrustful of June and easily persuaded by the people around him. As for June, I think she out shined everyone in Prodigy. I have to admit that I wasn't the biggest fan of her in Legend but she stole my heart in Prodigy. She was kick butt, rational, logical, never lost sight of the plan and faithful. Tess, for me, was very annoying and a jealous kid throughout the whole novel and I just couldn't stand her. We also have the new Elector who I surprisingly warmed up to.All in all, I would highly recommend fans of Legend to pick up Prodigy as soon as possible, and for fans of dystopian novels who haven't picked up Legend, to do so as soon as possible! This series is one of the best dystopian novels I have read!"
713,"Prodigy (Legend, #2)",0399256768,Marie Lu,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,Love love love it!!!!! When is the next book coming out? Lu has the right balance between romance and adventure. You learn a lot about June and Day. There're some very intersting twists and turns to the plot.

714,King Lear,074348276X,William Shakespeare,Barnes and Noble,4.3,JohnLemon,"This review is not of King Lear itself (one of my two favorite Shakespeare plays, with the other being Othello), but rather on this edition of Lear (ISBN: 9781411400795), which was edited by Andrew Hadfield and David Scott Kastan. 

I read a lot of heavily annotated books, and I have to say that the Barnes & Noble Shakespeare editions have one of the best book designs I've ever encountered. The various references materials (footnotes and definitions for archaic words) appear in a manner that makes the text very easy to follow.

The scholarship is also top-notch. The annotations give you enough to make things clear without insulting your intelligence, or without overburdening you with unnecessary detail. The essays are also interesting and informative.

I've been avoiding Shakespeare ever since high school, which was many years ago. Now that I'm reading him again, I'm glad I'm in such good hands. It is making the experience a joy, rather than a chore.

My compliments to the editors and the book designer. They have done a superior job of making this difficult text accessible to the modern reader. Highly recommended."
714,King Lear,074348276X,William Shakespeare,Barnes and Noble,4.3,typoo,The Barnes and Noble edition of the plays are my favorites to read.  The format of the books is great.  No jumping around to read the footnotes and text explanatory notes unless I want to. The play speaks for itself and has for hundreds of years.  I highly recommend all the B&N editions of his plays.
714,King Lear,074348276X,William Shakespeare,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,The Barnes & Noble Shakespeare editions are my favorites. The font and clean layout make them very readable and the notes are helpful without being distracting to the eye or burdensome to read. They are also very reasonably priced!
715,Death of a Salesman,0435233076,Arthur Miller,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Guest,"I have seen some really bad reviews here. Some said that Death of a Salesman was the worst book ever. Now I can imagine that some may not think as highly as I do of the book, but it can never be considered the worst ever. Those people obviously do not understand the true meaning and messages of the book, the things that maake Death of a Salesman a timeless masterpiece.     For you dumb shmucks out there, some thing the book was really about: communism; capitalism- in the cold and callous business world, personal connections and compassion and comprimised for profit and performace; trying to fulfill one's dreams with his children; escape from an undesirable life; sacrifice; -- just to name a few.     So, before you rip on a book, or anything, make sure you fully understand it."
715,Death of a Salesman,0435233076,Arthur Miller,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Guest,I read this book for an AP English Summer Reading assignment and quite enjoyed it.  It was a bit hard to follow at first but once you get started you start to understand more.  It's a sad but interesting story.  Warning: It's not for light readers there is depth to it so it requires a bit of thinking on the readers part.
715,Death of a Salesman,0435233076,Arthur Miller,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Guest,"Miller's play is an intimate study of the tragedy one family faces and their singular reaction to it.  The characters are so rich in their depiction of disillusionment, and they vividly exemplify the intense desire for an easier life.  I thoroughly enjoyed this play."
716,The Choice,0446579920,Nicholas Sparks,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"I picked up this book as something to read in my spare time, but it ended up gripping me for the two days it took to finish. It is the story of Gabby Holland and Travis Parker, two people destined to be together but are separated by heart-breaking choices. Sparks takes the reader through their meeting and falling in love, but Gabby has to choose between the boyfriend she's had for years and Travis, the man she's only known for three days. The story then leads to an even more unexpected choice that will bring you to tears. I recommend this to anyone who wants a quick and satisfying read."
716,The Choice,0446579920,Nicholas Sparks,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Lo-Garza,"I fell in love with this book. Nicholas Sparks is such an amazing author that I feel the need too read every single one of his books. He captures the center on the book and makes it seem a hundred times better than what it really it. I cried towards the end of the book, I'd read it again if I wanted too. This books taught me many lessons, and the lesson is: Never give up, life is full of amazing wonders but the most important wonder is LOVE."
716,The Choice,0446579920,Nicholas Sparks,Barnes and Noble,4.3,PrincessLulu,"I absolutely love this author. I was complety captivated in this book,
BUT, it also frustated the heck out of me. ""The Choice"" is not the choice we think it is. Part one felt like it was a whole different book from part 2, but it works. Sad, happy, relieved are just a few of the emotions that you will feel. 
It is a beautiful love story. I literally gave my husband a big kiss when he got home because it reminds you that love is so beautiful and so fragile. Such a great read."
717,The Hunger Games: Official Illustrated Movie Companion,0545422906,Kate Egan,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"This book gives you updates on the Capital fashions, the characters, and scenes. That isn't even the best part because the book has quotes and opinions from the cast."

I think this is worth buying if your a big fan, I have been reading alot of reviews and some fans have been doing the team thing and some don't like that. So I say I'm sideing with Katniss SHE pick the best guy Peeta so really I'm not really on any team I'm just happy with who she married. Gale maybe a hottie but what he did in the last book was cold and for me I don't care how hot you are you can't change your heartless actions."

718,The Sound and the Fury,0000000000,William Faulkner,Barnes and Noble,4,McCarthy92,"William Fauklner's forth novel and considered by many to be his masterpeice, The Sound and the fury is an absolute great read.  A Challenging yet rewarding book, the novel contains 4 chapters, each narrarated by 4 different speakers, the three Compson brothers and the fourth is told in third-person.  The First chapter is told by the mentally retarded benjy.  The Second is told by the sad elder-child Quentin, and the third told by the mean and selfish Jason.  many consider benjy's chapter to be the most difficult, however, I found the chapter a lot easier than Quentin to be much more difficult.  The last 2 chapters were very simple.  One of the best books I have ever read I would recommend reading SparkNotes for a litle aid if you are new to these harder and more rewarding works of fiction."
718,The Sound and the Fury,0000000000,William Faulkner,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"William Faulkner brilliantly tells the inherent evil in the ignorance that humans establish in life through the Compson family.  The setting takes place in the South where one family will not change from their slave driven ways causing the downfall and torture of every member.  You will see the consequences of evil ways through:   Caddy, the beautiful yet tragically promiscuous daughter.  Benjy, the mentally retarded manchild who can't grow up  Quentin, the suicidal son who is tortured with the realization of the evil that exists within his family  Jason, the posessor of this inherent evil that has been passed down through his family    This book is one that captures the truth of what ignorance can truly cause.  It is dark novel that gives but a glimpse to what the humans can possess.  This novel is one that I only hope everyone takes the time to read."
718,The Sound and the Fury,0000000000,William Faulkner,Barnes and Noble,4,christian2795,"I can only speculate as to the overall quality of the review to follow, as I have only read this book once. This is one that, after I set it down and thought about for a week, replaying key scenes and revisiting key images in my mind, I desired greatly to read again. But I didn't; I went ahead and read two other Faulkner novels, those being 'Light in August' and 'As I Lay Dying'. I found that I could not get enough of the man's work, because as a writer and something of a closet aesthete, I fell in love with his brilliant style, with its fluctuating regard for proper punctuation and its haunting stream-of-consciousness passages. I became intrigued by his characters and by the way they functioned and thought and failed. No book has altered the way that I think more than this one. This is one that remains always in the back of my mind even now, three months after completing it. I have never physically been to the South, but after reading this and two of his other novels, I feel that I know it much better than if I had simply gone and stayed in Mississippi for a week, having been taken there mentally, having felt the overwhelming hubris, impotency and humanity of the Compson family. One gets the feeling, reading through 'The Sound and the Fury', that Faulkner has tossed proper method out the window, leaving us only with the madness. I can only say that it is a madness well worth experiencing multiple times (in fact, it demands it), and that I shall be returning to it shortly."
719,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose,0452287588,Eckhart Tolle,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"When I first heard about A New Earth I was very skeptical the book wasn't going to say anything I hadn't already heard and as a Christian I was afraid it would mess with my faith in God. That is not what happened. The book is very intense but the webcast Oprah and Eckhart did helped me get a better grasp of what he was trying to say.  You do have to be ready for it and by that I mean already seeking your purpose and why you are really here or it won't make much sense to you. My advice is to read The Power of Now first and then you will get a better grasp on A New Earth.  Having discovered that the chatter that was going on in my head was not normal and the fact that I have been walking around unconscious most of my life, became my awakening moment and the chatter stopped!  I now recognize the ego and the pain body for what they are not only in me but those still in unconsciousness. You really can't fight against what is. I am now conscious and have more inner peace. Things that I use to let bother me no longer do. I've had to make some adjustments in my life, let some situations and people go but it was for my greater good. It's amazing what you find out when you really pay attention."
719,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose,0452287588,Eckhart Tolle,Barnes and Noble,4.1,MyGrace,"I have read this book about six times all the way through.  Everytime I read it, I get something new out of it.  It is appropriate for the rapid advancements in enlightenment.  I recommend this for anyone who already has a solid base in non-conforming spiritual awareness.  Awesome, awesome, book!"
719,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose,0452287588,Eckhart Tolle,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"I think that Eckhart Tolle's book, A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose, is one of the most significant and important, that I have ever read.  Friends that I have shared a copy with, have agreed.  It contains the answer for my personal search to overcome a lifelong struggle to overcome anxiety and depression, as well as to be more centered and spiritual.  
My work as a Therapist, as well as my personal challenges with my ego, has been greatly enlightened by Tolle's clear explanation.  Understanding the role and the working of the ego, has allowed me to begin to comprehend the inner presence.  The explanation of the collective ego, clearly points to importance of consciousness to end the conflicts and suffering that is plague our world."
720,"Bleach, Volume 01",1591164419,Tite Kubo,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Gekish,"Awesome series that is actually still running in Japan. This is the first book into a great adventure. I've watched the show and this is right in line with that. The Manga expands on the show by allowing for a more adult audience. It is backwards reading (manga style) and took a couple pages to get used to after that it was a page turner.  If you are into anime and haven't tried this series, it is a must buy. Well written and illustrated. My friend recommended it to me and I haven't been able to get enough since then. Warning though you may get hooked."

And while I will admit there are reused posts in Hyperbole and a Half, there is a good balance of old favourites and new material, enough to keep it familiar but still interesting. I think what makes Brosh so popular is her self-depreciating humour and the blatant honesty behind it. She acknowledges the hard truths alongside the absurd, is completely upfront about her shortcomings and accepts who she is without ever apologizing for it. These are all traits that I really admire and I think it&rsquo;s what makes her stories so relatable and, in turn, her blog so successful. There&rsquo;s also a dark wisdom underlying her work, especially with regard to the segment on depression. Being that I am someone who&rsquo;s struggled with depression in the past, I can especially appreciate what she&rsquo;s done here. She takes a concept few truly understand and manages to bring some clarity to it. It&rsquo;s hard for me to explain what she&rsquo;s with adequate coherency so I urge you to read it for yourself and see. On top of it all, I can&rsquo;t forget to mention the accompanying illustrations which are so simplistic in nature that they become effective. These cute yet crude drawings are surprisingly detailed and, even more surprisingly, they&rsquo;re good. They are good because they are simple. They are simple as to not distract from the overall message. They help to add new layers of meaning and comedy to the story in a way that words otherwise can&rsquo;t. They are the perfect complement to the directness and the occasional harshness of her storytelling. The combination of Brosh&rsquo;s pictures and words bring about a whole host of feelings to the reader, from laughter to hope to sympathy and even sometimes sadness. She makes you, the reader, feel things. And isn&rsquo;t that the point?"

I'm a longtime fan of the blog, and I love that I can now own most of my favorite stories from it in print. The new material is just as fantastic as the original web-based. There are some expletives used, but not -overused-, and none of the stories' material should cause discomfort (unless you happen to have had exceptionally bad experiences with geese, dogs, getting lost in the woods, or birthday cake). My grandmother read much of the book the night I got it, and absolutely loved it. Compare it to the average popular stand-up comedy act of today, and the writing is squeaky-clean. Overall, a long anticipated read, and well worth the money to have an exceptional piece of nostalgic/hilarious reading material and to support the lovely author."

That said, I really can't understand why the ebook costs as much as a paperback.  There's no ink or paper, no shipping, nothing that would hike the price.  Sure, someone has to type it out, but it shouldn't be just as expensive."

723,Shantaram,192076920X,Gregory David Roberts,Barnes and Noble,4.4,ReadingQueen12-17,"In protest to the chronic tangent in which this book was written, I am presenting my review in outline format.  Enjoy.  
What I liked: 
1. Tremendous adventure with MANY unique and memorable characters.  It's hard to believe that this book is pretty much a true story.
2. Incredible descriptions of India (Bombay in particular).  I've never traveled to India but in speaking to people who have read this book AND been to India, I am assured he captures the essence of this country to a tee.  Now the fact that a good part of the book takes place in a slum and I could just about smell the fecal festooned sidewalks through my mind's nostril is a different story, but still, very admirable descriptions.  
3. To piggy back on #2, I appreciated the history and cultural context he provided along with the events that affected the story (conflict with Iran, Pakistan, etc.)  To a history buff, this is always helpful and welcomed.  
What I Didn't Like:
1. The LENGTH - It is soul crushing and SO UNNECESSARY!!!!  I would've catapulted this book to a 5-star rating if he had kept to the story telling, which honestly would have cut the length in half, and avoided the self aggrandizing, completely obnoxious philosophical bull sh*t!!  I mean, ok, I get it, you went through hell and back, met some crazy powerful and charismatic people, found yourself, lost yourself, whatever. But when you're in the middle of telling me about a potentially huge drug bust, or about to go have sex with a woman with whom you've built up a tremendous amount of tension, I could give to flying f's about your thoughts about the universe moving towards the ""ultimate complexity"".  I. just.  don't. care. 
2. The ""Lesson per Chapter"" Approach - Again, to piggy back on #1, the ratio of actual story telling to the author's introspective musings is truly 60/40.  As I was saying earlier, in some cases these musings would pop up at a very inopportune moment in the story, but in most cases they appear in the closing of each chapter giving the book an infuriating ""lesson of the day"" feel to it.  Furthermore, the predictable apparition of these delusional gems honestly cheapened the message and by the second half the book I always knew when a chapter was coming to a close because my eyes would start rolling and my sighs of exasperation would increase in strength and volume.  
3. My Disappointment - I wanted so badly to love this book.  On almost every book site of which I am a member it gets rave reviews.  Multilple friends and family members recommended it to me with great enthusiasm.  But, alas, I just did not like it.  I finished it on Christmas Eve and had I not had several glasses of wine at that point, I would have thrown the book directly into the crackling fire out of pure spite."
723,Shantaram,192076920X,Gregory David Roberts,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"A meaty book, almost 1000 pages long, and every page leaves you hungry for more.

724,"From Dead to Worse (Sookie Stackhouse, #8)",0441015891,Charlaine Harris,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"From Dead to Worse is the 8th book in the Sookie   Stackhouse series and I really enjoyed the latest book.  So   much action taking place in this novel, lots of different   plots going on.  Sookie's boyfriend Quinn has disappeared   in this book and is no where to be found.  Vampires Eric,   Bill and Pam are back.  Bill is still asking Sookie to forgive   him and Eric is remembering the time he spent alone with   Sookie.  There is a Werewolf War and a hostile Vampire   takeover.  Sookie still has a roommate that has the cat (man) that   she used magic on to turn into said cat and can't change   him back.  The action opens up right away along with the many   twists and turns in this book, it is sure to keep your   interest until the end.  I am looking forward to book 9."

724,"From Dead to Worse (Sookie Stackhouse, #8)",0441015891,Charlaine Harris,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Mithy1,"I thought Sookie was really one dimensional in this book.  In her others I have found her to be lacking in emotion and way too deep in denial about things but the books were quite enjoyable.  This book however had me thinking of her as a completely unforgiving, emotionless, self-centered snot.  For someone who started off as being non-judgmental and compassionate to others ""crosses to bear"" she sure isn't portraying that in this book.  Also, aside from pretty much ostracizing all the men who care for her right out of her life, there are no romantic moments...none.  She just keeps finding reasons (very selfish ones at times) to keep dumping on the men who want to love or at least like her.I don't know, maybe Charlaine wanted to show how jaded she is becoming by being indebted to all the Supes.  This book had too many plots going on, and because of that, it was rushed and had no feeling.I'm sorry, but this was not nearly as good as the prior books."

725,"The Waste Lands (The Dark Tower, #3)",0670032565,"Stephen King, Ned Dameron",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Jon Pearson,"Just to clear up a few things.  Yes, there are some typographical mistakes in this book, but it's not bad at all (and that sort of thing bothers me).  There's all of perhaps 5-10 misspellings throughout the entire book along side a handfull of inappropriate periods.  The misspellings are simple too; things like ""tne"" instead of ""the"", or ""uncomfortabte"" instead of ""uncomfortable"".  Yes, there are a few errors in the editing; but nothing that will distract you from the story.  As for the story itself; I found the first portion to be a little slow; but the entire 2nd half was truly a great read.  From the moment with the mansion forward, it was not one I wanted to stop reading.   Don't skip this one just because of a few people complaining about a lack of 'perfect' formatting.  It's really not bad at all."

Really annoying to have to pick up the paper version in order to get caught up! This is why I have a nook!

Product problems aside, another great book in my favorite series of all time."
726,"The Bone Collector (Lincoln Rhyme, #1)",0451188454,Jeffery Deaver,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Neil_Collins,"I had seen the movie adaptation of this book long before I knew anything about the book itself. When I stumbled upon Jeffery Deaver, the author, and discovered a series featuring Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs, I wanted to read them all, based on how much I had enjoyed the film.

As is all to often the case, the book and the film share a title and a few elements, but the stories are so very different as to be nearly unrelated. Fortunately, Mr. Deaver's story was exceptionally well written. I found the construction of the storyline dynamic and exciting, and the fact that it differed so from the movie left me guessing at many of his twists and turns.

For those unfamiliar with the story, Lincoln Rhyme was the most brilliant forensic investigator ever to have been a part of the NYPD. He had created their protocol for forensic investigation, worked with the FBI, established databases for cataloging trace evidence. He'd done it all. Until a falling beam on a crime scene he was working stuck him, crushing the fourth cervical vertebra, leaving his supercharged brain nearly the only working part of his body. His head and shoulders, a little movement in his left ring finger, and his vivid recollection of the city are all he has; other than a desire to end his own life.

Patrol Officer Amelia Sachs is a tall, beautiful, former model with aspirations of getting off the street and into her new assignment in public relations. In ways, she may be even more damaged than even Rhyme. When she is called to investigate the report of a partially buried body, she discovers an intentionally left clue to a series of abduction murders. Murders that have not yet happened.

Racing against time, Rhyme is reluctantly drafted to run the forensics, and he pulls in the equally reluctant Sachs as his eyes and legs to work the scenes. The resulting symbiosis is far greater than the sum of its parts, and the whirlwind telling of the story is masterful.

The Bone Collector is an energetic and well researched book, full of vivid and often troubling images. Jeffery Deaver has done a fantastic job here, and I whole heartedly recommend this book to all."
726,"The Bone Collector (Lincoln Rhyme, #1)",0451188454,Jeffery Deaver,Barnes and Noble,4.5,UpAllNight,"I have been a follower of the ""New Religion"", Forensics, for years.  While laid up with an injury, I discovered ""Forensic Files"" on CourtTV... which, unlike entertaining ""scripted"" TV series such as CSI, does not spoon-feed or sugar-coat the science behind solving crime for the audience.  That being said, Mr. Deaver gives me the pleasure of enjoying true forensics... not something dumbed-down for the enjoyment of the masses.  Truly, how often is the Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer even mentioned on CSI?  Mr. Deaver is obviously very comfortable with the inner workings of forensic science... making sure his characters are fully capable of bandying the terms back and forth in a way that makes perfect sense to the audience, while never bogging down the break-neck pace of the story - a talent some other authors could well benefit from learning."

It bypasses The Stranger by miles.  Very hartwarming and, yet, disturbing.  If you have ever taken the simple skill of reading for granted this novel will force you to think upon it."
727,The Reader,0375408266,"Bernhard Schlink, Carol Brown Janeway",Barnes and Noble,3.8,Anonymous,"Very easy read.  the first half of the book is sensual, sexual, and lulls you into a very comfortable exploration of forbidden love reminiscent of The Graduate.  The characters could have been any two people in any country or time, sharing intimate encounters and a love of literature.  Then the heartbreak of losing his first lover unexplainably seems to fit right into the assumed genre.  But the second half of the book had me spellbound, trying to balance the inhumane horror of the woman on trial with the woman previously in love.  I won't spoil the ending for anyone who hasn't read it or seen the movie.  But the author reveals the woman's motivations slowly while highlighting the boy's and societies' inability to separate the whats from the whys.  I was especially impressed with the author's exploration of the generational blame of a country humiliated by the horrors of genocide."

728,"Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?",0805047905,"Bill Martin Jr., Eric Carle",Barnes and Noble,4.6,ReadingToLena,"I started reading this to my daughter shortly after she was born.  I found that making the animal sounds while reading engaged her attention, even as early as only a few months.  Over time she began to pick up on the sounds and make them herself.  She's 20 months now and we read this book ""together"" - I read the words, she makes the animal sounds.  Sometimes I even catch her ""reading"" the book alone - flipping the pages and making the sounds for each animal.  I have several other Carle books and am a huge fan of all of them!"
728,"Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?",0805047905,"Bill Martin Jr., Eric Carle",Barnes and Noble,4.6,Guest,"I personally enjoyed this book as a child. The book is filled with bold colors and all sorts of animals. Its context is easy to read and understandable which helps the child follow the story and not become apathetic. Every page gives you a beautiful full size picture of an animal to look at and the intriguing feeling as to what animal will come up next. Because of the books rhythmical storyline it helps the child read along even if he or she cannot read yet. The books story is almost like a song. Not only will this book help your child follow a great story it will help them develop skills such as colors, shapes and names of animals. I would recommend this book to children of all ages especially beginners. They will enjoy this book every time."

However, don't be fooled into thinking this book stands on it own, it doesn't.  At page 560 you'll realize that nothing will be resolved and  apparently  you'll need to read the sequel to get some semblance of a complete story."

Dan Simmons captures the imagination with the 7 pilgrim's tales and keep it riveted to the page the entire time - you'll love and hate each of the pilgrims.  Which will get their wish granted by the Shrike?
729,"Hyperion (Hyperion Cantos, #1)",0553283685,Dan Simmons,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"When Dan Simmons struck out to create the world that is contained in Hyperion, he must have had a grand vision of the future: man spread across the reaches of known space and a symbiosis of man and machine.  What the reader takes away from this grand vision is a sense of awe and wonder.  Each of the characters, in their own way, contributes to the fluidity of the story and to the environment around them.  Simmons gracefully sets up each of the many looming conflicts, and resolves most of them with an ending that is extremely satisfying but leaves the reader ready for the sequel (which is also very, very good).  All in all, it is more than just a book.  It is a concept which was crafted together masterfully by Simmons and his wonderful writing, plot, characters, and most of all, universe."
730,The Pearl,0142000698,John Steinbeck,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Jay_Battle,"In the book The Pearl by John Steinbeck, the main character Kino faces a dilemma after finding a pearl in the ocean. Kino and his wife live in a little village and, one day while diving, Kino spots something shiny stuck on a rock. Kino realizes it is a pearl and he chips it off of the rock. At first Kino didnt believe that there would really be a pearl in such a shell, but sure enough he opens it up and sees the pearl inside. The news spreads around the village and every one wants to see it. Village members, including friends of the family, are willing to do anything to get their hands on this pearl because of the wealth and power it would potentially bring them. Soon after the discovery Kino's son, Coyotito, is stung by a scorpion and soon becomes ill and Kino and his wife take him to the doctor in the city. When the guard at the gate sees the family approaching, he tells them the doctor is not there. The guard says this beacuse he sees that Kino will have no way of paying the doctor, until Kino tells him about the pearl. The doctor goes to Kino's house and ""cures"" Coyotito. After everyone has heard about the pearl Kino begins hearing things stirring in the night next to his hut and goes out to see what is causing the noise. This occurs twice in the story, and both times, Kino comes back covered in blood. Juanita, Kino's wife, knows that the pearl is no good and may even be evil. One night Juanita becomes so fed up with the pearl that she takes it and tries to throw it back into the ocean but Kino was driven by anger and beats her when he sees this happeneing. Overall, there are lots of tragic incidents in this story and the pearl brings nothing but problems, pain, death and the loss of family itself. The theme I see fit for this story is that basically, money and power can drive you to go to impossible measures, and that in the end, it isnt worth all of the strain it causes a person."
730,The Pearl,0142000698,John Steinbeck,Barnes and Noble,3.5,VanillaBean,"The Pearl is a classic by the excellent writer, John Steinbeck.  A simple story, yet filled with dramatic characters and events that kept me flipping the pages.  One of the best aspects of The Pearl is the writing.  John Steinbeck's writing is untouchable and classic.  I loved the Pearl and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a classic book that shows culture and the value of materials and wealth over love."
730,The Pearl,0142000698,John Steinbeck,Barnes and Noble,3.5,WTVCrimeDawg,"The Pearl is an excellent tale--one of my favorites.  It's a simple classic that explores the depths of man's darkest nature.  The protagonist, Kino, is a young, poor pearler in tune with family and nature, but a tragic event exemplifies his discontent with life's meager offering for his oppressed little village.  Kino's luck dramatically improves when he finds the Pearl of the World.  Yet the Pearl summons the evil spirit of mankind, instead of bringing the fortune Kino desires.  Kino subsequently becomes suspicious of almost everyone, including his loving wife, for those who covet the Pearl will do anything to steal it.  Will Kino successfully protect his family and sell the Pearl before those who covet it catch him?  Is he willing to risk everything to improve his stake in life?"

I'm on page 234 of Midnight Sun and the dread of knowing it will soon end before we get to the meadow saddens me, AGAIN. We know how Bella feels and what she thinks in each scene and Midnight Sun tells us how Edward feels and what he thinks up to that meadow scene. I enjoy the little things...like the knowing smiles and odd looks each has when in the others' company. This is just wrong on so many levels to cheat us out of that and give us...Bree? Why?

It takes place on San Piedro Island off the Pacific Coast. The story alternates from the trial of a Japanese American on trial for murder in 1954 to the background stories of the relevant characters leading up to WWII and after. Snow Falling on Cedars brings up questions of loyalty, racism and forgiveness. The mood of the novel matches it's scenery, dark and stormy. The love stories are passionate and emotional. The writing is beautifully descriptive. David Guterson brings the island of San Piedro and it's inhabitants vividly to life in a novel I'll not soon forget."

734,Roots: The Saga of an American Family,0440174643,Alex Haley,Barnes and Noble,4.8,Guest,"Whatever parts are fact or fiction, it's obvious the world needed this book -- but especially black and white Americans.    It lays to bare the horrific exploitation of slavery whose effects continue to this day.  Race was used an excuse to dehumanize an entire continent of people for greed.  Haley successfully re-humanized the enslaved to provide an accurate portrayal of slavery's victims.    Similar books are still needed for a variety of aggrieved people who have suffered the worst effects of colonialism.  But Haley probably accomplished his goals better than anyone else could have dreamed."
734,Roots: The Saga of an American Family,0440174643,Alex Haley,Barnes and Noble,4.8,Guest,"Even if the dear professor above says this book is fiction, one can not dismiss the fact Alex Haley was an exceptional writer.  This is the only book I've ever read that I've literally screamed aloud and thrown across the room.  While I didn't think it was purely autobiographical, I got the feeling that it wasn't so far from the mark with the history of African Americans in the USA.    It's erroneous to dismiss Haley as one of the greatest writers of our times simply because some of the story ideas where slightly amelgamated into Roots.  You can say the same thing about John Jakes 'Love and War' and Tolstoy's 'War and Peace'.  Being inspired by a story is not the same as plagarizing and as it says in one of the oldest books on the planet, 'There's nothing new under the sun.'    They said the same about MLK with plagarism and I question the motives.    If you liked this book, also read his biography of 'Malcolm X'.  Spike Lee did a major disservice to Haley's writing in the movie version as it didn't capture the sheer magnitude of the man like Haley did."

Alan Moore has created one of the most phenomenal and chilling contributions to the legacy of Batman's archnemesis, creating what may be the most subscribable backstories for the villain. The horrific, mesmerizing sequence in the fun house, as Gordon's sanity is put to the excruciating test, is arguably one of The Clown Prince of Crime's greatest transgressions against humanity. Buy it."
735,Batman: The Killing Joke,0930289455,"Alan Moore, Brian Bolland, Tim Sale",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Jayden-Raynor,"Creepy and thrilling, this is the ultimate in comic book stories. It explores the Joker's psyche in a truly fascinating way and, in his attempt to turn Commissioner Gordon as crazy as himself,  unravels the timeless villain in a way never done before."

736,Invisible Man,0679732764,Ralph Ellison,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"When I first began reading this book, I admit that it was almost overwhelming...so many pages. But as I continued I realized that the journey was necessary. It was a time that needed to be fully understood in all it's primal glory. Racism truly has permeated society. A great book and great read!"
736,Invisible Man,0679732764,Ralph Ellison,Barnes and Noble,4.1,clearwatersflowafter,"I read it over 10 years ago.  But it is one of only a handful of books that has stayed with me for years. It significantly changed my understanding and compassion for the black experience in America.   It is the descent of an man into obscurity...hidng in plain sight.  The haunting images from the book of eyes passing over yours in a crowd, no hint of a recognition of shared humanity, of not being noticed, of being ignored due to preconceived stereotypes were very powerful.   Mr. Ellison put into words some thoughts that hover in the background, but rarely reach consciousness."

737,A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier,0374105235,Ishmael Beah,Barnes and Noble,4.3,iluvvideo,"This book chronicles the childhood of young Ishmael in Sierra Leone. A fairly normal childhood until he is forced to run into the jungle as soldiers attack his village killing everyone they can catch and looting and burning the rest.

For a short while flanked by others his age in similar situations he survives life constantly on the run. Then he is captured by a group of soldiers and retrained to think right and to be a soldier in the conflict. Some of the 'retrainee' soldiers are only 8 or 9 years old! Are these rebels trying to overthrow the government? Or the army protecting the citizens? Turns out not to matter. Each side is equally brutal and vicious. There is no good guys, only bad. He learns to fight, shoot and kill as well as the real soldiers. And to help avoid any feelings or reflection on his activities he is given access to various drugs to 'amp' him up further. 

By the grace of whatever higher power you choose to believe in, he gets selected for deprogramming and entry back into society. Not an easy task, but due to the incredible efforts of UNICEF and others it is finally done. Find out what has become of this young man and his new life. It is an unbelievable story.

If it all wasn't the truth. No punches spared. No letting himself off easy after his actions. Most poignantly the story is clearly written by a child.No ghostwriters to neaten it up. You get the whole horrible story from the raw emotional perspective of a 12 year old! I know I would not have survived as well as he has did. You can't help but cry as you turn the pages and confront one terror after another. Everyone should read this book!"
737,A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier,0374105235,Ishmael Beah,Barnes and Noble,4.3,drummerboy,"In Ishmael Beah&rsquo;s A Long Way Gone, he presents the ideas of living in poverty in Sierra Leone, Africa, as well as finding a method to survive in times of hardship. Beah has an approach to the writing that leans toward expository, though he still crafts a well-written memoir. Beah&rsquo;s purpose of writing this novel is to let us feel his emotion through the perilous events rather than having the emotion given to us.
A Long Way Gone is a memoir (pointed out in the novel&rsquo;s subtitle Memoirs of a Boy Soldier), though the writing does not express a full rendition of a memoir. Beah often lingers off into expository writing, where he informs us of impactful situations instead of showing us true feelings about them. Even though Beah feels strong opposition towards the war, he approaches it in the calmest of ways when he writes. Of course, A Long Way Gone is not for the sensitive reader; it should appeal more to readers who have read a similar book about poverty or hardship in the past. For me personally, A Long Way Gone sends some mixed messages when it comes to reading a piece of writing revolving around war and the extreme efforts to survive through it. However, this novel has a powerful impact on the way I think of discrimination and the terrible lives of the crippled and poor.
As the author, Ishmael Beah&rsquo;s premises for A Long Way Gone are wrapped around his amazement at how he managed to survive or transport to the United States alive. It was his willingness and urge to write about his experiences that gave us A Long Way Gone. 
To sum it up, the story raises issues such as constant depression in the war, where people are forced to survive in harsh conditions while being savagely treated by their enemies. This is a common theme in the book. Quite accordingly, the author emphasizes this theme through the description of hard-to-bear situations such as not being fed, not being protected, and not being the hunter of the game, but the hunted.
The clearness of A Long Way Gone is good enough so that you can recognize characters and their personalities, as well as events, themes, patterns, and significant information. It is also clear enough to see that the book&rsquo;s life-threatening situations are having an impact on Beah. If Beah&rsquo;s ultimate goal in writing this book was to expose the injustice of the war and leave it exposed, then I&rsquo;d say he achieved that goal."
737,A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier,0374105235,Ishmael Beah,Barnes and Noble,4.3,jlasagna,"A long way gone is an amazing story about a 12 year old boy named Ishmael Beah, who wants to be a rapper, living in a war torn country. He experience many hard ships through his life including graphic killings, horrific scenery, drug use, and lose of his family members. He is being chased by the ruthless rebels who want to take over the country and is backed into a corner. With hard times and with little combat training by the government he takes his gun and decides to fight back. His only options are kill or be killed.

	This book was an amazing book. It opened my eyes to how real and horrible some countries are. Young kids not even teenagers being forced to fight, snort cocaine mixed with gun powder, and watch people they love die gruesome deaths on a regular basis is just mind blowing to me. This book is not your average fairy tale. It is a very graphic and real book but if you are looking for something to open your eyes to what is really going on out there, this is the book for you"

A friend recommended this book to me, and I found the book on tape at the library. It was so fascinating! My entire family loved it! I was impressed at how the author was able to answer every single question that I had (such as how could the rats find tools small enough to use, small technical stuff that most authors fail to explain) The story was incredibly intricate, but never failed to be interesting and slightly humorous. I recommend this book to anyone."
738,"Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH (Rats of NIMH, #1)",0689862202,Robert C. O'Brien,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,This book is wonderful. I love it. It is very entertaining and shows a clear point of view from a mouse. My favorite part was when one of the rats tell Mrs. Frisby about how Johnathan Frisby helped the rats. It answers my questions about Johnathan Frisby. It is very sad that he died. This book was so good I could not put it down.
739,Different Seasons,0751514624,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.4,jseger9000,"Different Seasons is a showcase for Stephen King. Four diverse novellas, only one of them the kind of horror tale he is synonymous with (and it may be the weakest of the bunch).

The book is divided into four 'seasons': Hope Springs Eternal (Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption), Summer of Corruption (Apt Pupil), Fall From Innocence (The Body) and A Winter's Tale (The Breathing Method). The tones of the stories alternate between light and dark, with Apt Pupil perhaps being the darkest thing he has ever written.

Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption is a mini-masterpiece of a tale. A tale of hope set in a prison, dealing with a man whose spirit remains free despite all obstacles. I'd originally read it years before the legendary movie, and was worried that it wouldn't be quite the same reading it now. Luckily King's narrative holds up. Even knowing what was coming, the story telling was as gripping as ever.

Apt Pupil. I was almost dreading rereading Apt Pupil. A well written but morally disturbing tale of the mutually parasitic relationship between a young California golden boy and the Nazi war criminal he has blackmailed. It is an excellent dark thriller, but it is so powerfully written and so pitch black, you are kept in suspense while feeling the need to cleanse yourself of the story being told. I remember the 'Bachman book' Rage felt a little like this, but Apt Pupil provokes a much stronger reaction and is a better book overall.

Third up is The Body which was famously (and very faithfully) adapted into the movie Stand By Me. This is Stephen King's coming of age tale of four boys in 1960 who head out through the woods to find the body of a boy that was struck by a train.

Though all four of the stories are top-notch Stephen King, I believe I enjoyed The Body the most. King so expertly captures the bittersweet feeling of the boys, two of which at least understand that they are going through a life changing experience; that things will not be the same from here on.

The Breathing Method is the closest to Stephen King's 'typical' supernatural spook story. This one (appropriately dedicated to Peter Straub) seems to be King's answer to Straub's Chowder Society (see Straub's Ghost Story), as it deals with a group of old men that belong to a mysterious 'gentleman's club' where they tell each other stories.

Earlier I called The Breathing Method the weakest story here. It is, but please don't take that to mean that the story isn't worth reading. It is a good read that only pales because the other three stories shine so brightly.

This is the book I would loan to someone who looked down on King without reading any of his work. He shows that while he can write some very scary spook stories, that isn't why he sells so many books. Each of the four stories is King writing at the top of the game. There's a reason three of the four stories have been turned into movies and they are three of the best screen adaptations he's had."
739,Different Seasons,0751514624,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"The book contains four of Stephan King's short stories, plus an afterward by the author himself. One of the stories, ""The Body,"" was the basis of the beloved 1980's film ""Stand By Me,"" starring River Phoenix, amoung others. The movie was definetly the reason I purchased this book. The short story is just as good, if not better than the movie. It really lived up to my expectations. If you haven't read the story of seen the movie yet, I'd reccomend both!"
739,Different Seasons,0751514624,Stephen King,Barnes and Noble,4.4,B_Brennan,"Stephen King keeps me waiting for more. I love stort stories and King is a master. I keep this book bedside and read until all hours! I tend to read his short stories and novellas in Esquire and elsewhere, plus one of these stories turned into the movie: Shawshank Redemption. I like Kings more recent books: less gory and more psychological and science fiction-ish!!"

But as a Christian, I fully expected to be offended by this book. Didn't happen. Sure, there's some strange stuff here -- wouldn't be Moore if it wasn't . But in the end, he pretty much gets it right! I found myself at times wiping away the tears of laughter and thinking, ""Ya know, it coulda happened just like that."" Maybe.  I teach Sunday School and Bible studies, and I believe every Christian with a sense of humor should read this book! Those of you who don't have a sense of humor should probably skip it."

The hijinks that Biff and Josh get into is nothing short of fall on the floor laughing funny. The random humor interpieced with factual accounts of Jesus' travels makes the book completely worth the money. If you are looking for a book that will make you laugh, this is the one for you. Most people will appreciate the religous comedy if they have a sense of humor themselves. Not reccommended for the die-hard religous."

744,The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment,1577314808,Eckhart Tolle,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"After reading happiness books like ""Finding Happiness in a Frustrating World"", I felt like I had a good handle on what science had uncovered about how to live a happy life and have to say that I am MUCH happier for having read them. But, while the field of positive psychology has made some great contributions to my happiness levels, it's books like ""The Power of Now"" that come along and let you know there's STILL more you can learn. A key concept of the book (if I'm explaining it right) is that you will start to experience a certain kind of enlightenment when you learn to leave your analytical mind behind. In other words, instead of ""thinking"" try just ""observing your thinking."" And when you do this, you also need to realize that all this ""thinking noise"" that goes on in your head all day long is not really who you are- an enlightening concept indeed! To that end, the book is set up in a question and answer format to help you get to understand these kinds of concepts. While it might seem ridiculous to some, it really isn't. Case in point, we all talk to ourselves or have witnessed others talking to themselves at times (maybe during a sporting event perhaps). If you ask someone who they are talking to, they will usually say ""I'm talking to myself."" And this, by definition, means that there have to be two ""selves"", an ""I"" talking to ""myself""- and so justifies the idea of two selves (a ""you"" and a ""thinking you"" in the book). Well, if these seem to be the kind of concepts you're ready to explore, this is your book. It raises some good questions and certainly brings up one that you can't argue with: all we have is the here and now. As the book so astutely points out, ""Nothing ever happened in the past; it happened in the Now. Nothing ever happened in the future, it will happen in the Now."" And learning to live in the now IS the point of the whole book."
744,The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment,1577314808,Eckhart Tolle,Barnes and Noble,4.2,StephanieR,"I wrote ""Love From Both Sides,"" and I thank Tolle and his ""The Power of Now"" in it because he helped me through an extremely challenging time. My husband died, leaving me $180,000 in debt, no insurance, no retirement, no savings.  Nothing. I didn't have a job, and I was 55. But because I read Tolle's book, and kept asking myself the kind of questions he suggests, I made it through a dark time and lived to write a book about it. I'm now a working hypnotherapist, and to help my clients stay centered and calm, I use Tolle's suggestions and always recommend his books.  Whatever you can read to calm yourself down these days, and create happiness in your heart not only helps you, but all whom you love. That's what the new scientific research proves."
744,The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment,1577314808,Eckhart Tolle,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"This book is amazing.It is truly moving and thought-provoking.What is absolutely fabulous about it though, is that it talks about every religion and their beliefs and values. So for those skeptics out there,or bashers of Christianity,calm down! It's not all about that.This book just seeks to help relieve stress, find what is truly important,silence the voice in your head that is constantly nagging you and just help you live a better life.It has certainly helped me be able to get over disappointments and stress much faster and easier.Now every little thing in life is truly amazing for what it is.It helped me let go of the ego and just be.'Ego' is also Latin for 'I,' funnily enough.But it is a false I,and we must not concern ourselves with this imposter.My life has vastly improved and there is much need for that,especially in the times during which we are living. The world is in bad need of a reality check.I highly recommend this book, but when reading it please keep an open mind and let Tolle take you on an amazing journey,and really do the meditations, just sit, think,calm down and let revelation wash over you.It is a truly amazing feeling, this liberation."

I have enjoyed her Blog--The Bloggess, for quite awhile. There were some very wonderful vignettes in the pages of her book. I love the tales of childhood, her husband, odd family greatly peppered with her 'drunken sailor' mouth but there were a few things lacking&hellip;.such as the footnotes&hellip;.uugh&hellip;. way to many references to her 'next book' and the leading you in paragraphs&hellip;such as &hellip;'don't read this if you don&rsquo;t like_________, I'm there I bought/got the book..don't spend your or my time talking me out of it. Also (and I am going to blame the editors on this one) there were chapters that, as a reader, were clearly out of order. I guess I wanted MORE. Funny- yes&hellip;but somehow lacking, I thought it would be much MUCH more than her blog, but it is in effect mostly just a rehash of posts that I have already read.

I will have to say, there were parts of the book that moved slowly for me. I felt it was a bit too descriptive in parts. However, it turned out to be one of the best damn stories I've ever read. On the edge of your seat excitement and suspense. Excellent character development and a great plot. Locke Lamora & his comrade Jean Tammen are now some of my favorite characters ever. There were a few things that happened in the story that really pissed me off & I wished wouldn't have happened. But the story & ending were just awesome. Red Seas Under Red Skies, here I come."
746,"The Lies of Locke Lamora (Gentleman Bastard, #1)",0553804677,Scott Lynch,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Straysod,"I hate leaving reviews that sound like they were written by the publisher to promote the book, but dang, it is hard not to just enthusiastically spout praise when a book is this freaking good. So I will say that this is an amazing book, spectacularly written, a story deftly weaved, characters to adore, action to make you bite your knuckles, and a plot to keep you guessing continuously, and then I will stop spouting praise.

More to the point, these are the kinds of things you can expect from this book. If you don't like them, then you probably won't like the book.
-The plot is convoluted, complex and mysterious. You will be kept guessing all the way through.
-It can get very dark. This is not a fluffy, happy tale. There is humor (very very well done humor!) but even more striking are the moments that make you weep.
-While the POV doesn't shift between characters much, there is some time shift. So if you're not willing to follow more than one story, this is not the book for you.
-The action is spectacular, well written and exciting, but not overwhelming. The book is definitely propelled by its plot and characters. 
Other than that, all I can say it that it is a superb example of the fantasy genre, with a beatiful, realistic, and complex world, endearing, charming characters, and a gorgeously twisted plot."

I first picked the book up in 2001 when I was in high school.  I can honestly say that this was the first book I actually ""read""  straight through without hardly putting down.  The character development is very well done.  Specifically with Sabriel coming into  her own as The Abhorsen.  Mogget, the cat, is a very funny comic relief, where as, Touchstone the sworn sword for her, is the strong silent type.  All three characters blend together to make  a wonderful fantasy novel.  It's full of action adventure, suspense, comedy little romance.  Everything a good novel should be.  I would suggest to anyone who is a fantasy fan, read this book and the entire series."

748,"Dead and Gone (Sookie Stackhouse, #9)",0441017150,Charlaine Harris,Barnes and Noble,4.4,dalnewt,"I truly enjoy this series and heartily recommend this latest multi-layered addition. This book is a murder mystery about the crucifixion of Sookie's estranged were-panther sister-in-law and a tale of survival when Sookie becomes the target in a war between two faerie factions. These two story lines, with the help of a few plot twists, are ingeniously interconnected and thrillingly concluded. The romantic sub-plot (which begins a relationship between Sookie and Eric and ends with Sookie's last minute doubts about Bill) is also a fun and interesting read. Personally, I hope her relationship with Eric continues for awhile. Although Sookie has not yet realized who she really loves, I have no doubt that her 'true love' will be revealed at the series' end. Until then, I'm happily, (although a bit impatiently), along for the ride.

Occasionally, the story's flow is slightly slowed by extraneous events (see below)*; however, overall reading enjoyment is not diminished. Further, unresolved issues concerning the FBI and Sookie's half-fae great uncle linger at book's end. Although unessential to solving the mystery, these unsettled matters tend to niggle any reader who prefers 'end of book' answers to all questions. 

As regards the Eric vs. Bill dilemma, IMO Bill and Sookie have been done to death. Bill will fight to the death for Sookie, but in Dallas he pursued the humans leaving Sookie unprotected while Eric took a bullet for her. Plus, Bill has always disregarded Sookie's monetary needs, (like her potholed driveway), while perversely providing economic independence for his distant and clueless descendants. In contrast, even when uninvolved with Sookie, Eric was attentive to her economic needs and tried to help her to the greatest extent she would allow. Most importantly, Eric has never really been in-love and he doesn't really know what Sookie means to him. In the distant past he cared for his family, but he never had a love relationship. He doesn't know what it means when he wonders why he hasn't had 'enough' of Sookie even after a night of lovemaking, and that is pretty intriguing. On the other hand, when Sookie asked Bill to emotionally commit to her in the past, Bill responded by telling her that he had already lived and loved during his human life. (Note, I'm not even counting Bill's presumably involuntary break-up with Skokie at the direction of his maker, and his sudden disappearance from her life. Plus, it's impossible to forget Bill's 'car trunk' rape and mauling of Sookie, as well as his failure to reveal that he had been ordered to befriend and seduce her.) Of course, there's always Sam. He loves Sookie and, as an added bonus, he's actually alive.  


*(Unnecessary/unresolved subjects include: Octavia's immaterial household presence and departure; Sam's inconsequential out-of-state trek and family problems; the FBI's superfluous and unresolved involvement; Quinn's pointless and brief appearance; Hunter's clairvoyance issues; the seemingly useless knowledge about the unavenged killing of Sookie's parents; the inexplicable behavior and questionable motivation and whereabouts of Sookie's half-fae great uncle; and the diverting but unessential public 'shapeshifter' reveal.)"

I also like the fact that they touche on how shady Arlene is. I was wondering when they were going to make her attack sookie. I liked how you can forshadow Eric and Bill fighting over Sookie in away. All in all i thought i was a good book and an easy read. It was way better then the last two. This one was full of drama and new things in each chapter!"
748,"Dead and Gone (Sookie Stackhouse, #9)",0441017150,Charlaine Harris,Barnes and Noble,4.4,TNVolsFan25,"Let me start by saying I'm a huge fan of Mrs. Harris' work (not just the Southern Vampire series). She is one of the few authors that I keep coming back too. I have almost always found her books entertaining and well-written. With that being said I would like to review Dead and Gone, the latest installment in the Sookie Stackhouse series. This book managed (in 320 pages)to take away everything that I have ever like about this series. Let me explain. One thing I like about the books is that they are told from Sookie's point of view. While this book does the same thing, it was horrible because there was hardly any dialogue. The book was mainly filled with her thinking...could've, would've, should've. Blah, I can do that myself and don't want to read about someone else doing it no matter how short the book is. Basically if this book were to be made into a movie it would fall under the silent film category. Secondly, while a lot of loose ends were tied up, there was hardly any plot at all. Yes, there was a murder, but haven't we come to expect a murder in this series by now (one way or another). There was also a war with the supernatural. Again, not the first time that's been done in this series. The war (if one can call it a war) didn't take place until close to the end of the book and was over within a couple of pages. It seemed to me that Mrs. Harris threw the war into the book because she realized after page 290 that her book was anticlimactic. Hopefully the real Mrs. Harris didn't write this. Any day now the publisher will issue a statement apologizing for the huge mistake. Then, the FBI will quit wasting time in this book and start investigating the real problem...who is this imposter claiming to be Charlaine Harris? To sum it up, I feel more than disappointed. Some of the characters are thrown in just to make some sort of appearance and our protagonist acts as if she will have a mental breakdown and end up in a straightjacket. I understand Sookie has been through a lot and feels strained. However, if that's the direction Mrs. Harris is going to take her personality I think it would be best to set the next book up in the Bahamas. Otherwise, Sookie won't be much use to us. In Hindsight, maybe I built this book up to much (I had a year) and I ended up setting my expectations so high that no matter what Mrs. Harris wrote I would've been disappointed. Then again, maybe the increase in fans, money and demands became to much for Mrs. Harris and this was the result. Maybe, it was both reasons."
749,The Storyteller,1439102767,Jodi Picoult,Barnes and Noble,4.4,anne_reads,"At times intense and disturbing. A story that challenges your thoughts about good and evil and the mix of both in everyone. Is everyone worthy of redemption or do some go so far that they are unworthy of any level of compassion? Can you feel compassion and still hold people accountible for their actions? Can you see both the monster and the human - or by becoming a monster do you loose all pieces of your soul? Interesting characters - complex personalities where past and present meet. I've read a few reviews that express disappointment at the ending. I didn't feel that way - although I can see their point. I find the main character's final actions completely in line with who she is and her inner conflicts. However you feel about the ending, the story will stay with you and leave you thinking and -to me - that's a sign of a well written novel."

750,"Obsidian (Lux, #1)",1620610078,Jennifer L. Armentrout,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Andreat78,"There are a few authors that I know I can always count on, my ""Old Faithfuls"". I can always count on their books leaving me satisfied, thrilled and usually wanting for more. I'm talking about authors such as Cassandra Clare, Jeri Smith-Ready, and a few others. Now, I am without a doubt adding Jennifer Armentrout to that list. To be honest, I went into Obsidian expecting another good book from Armentrout. What I didn't expect was for Obsidian to completely rock my world!

I don't even know how to start explaining my love for this book. Maybe the story. New girl in town meets hot, snarky guy. Sparks fly. Literally. Their being together is bad news. Like, deadly bad news. Seriously, in Obsidian, the author has taken the teen alien story and given it the coolest, most unique spin. I always strive for spoiler-free reviews. I love for the reader to be able to discover the intricate details of the story for themselves. So I'm not going into the nitty-gritty of the story. Just trust me when I say that as far as these books go, Obsidian is, to me, heads and shoulders above books such ""I Am Number Four"", which I really liked. 

The characters in Obsidian are so vivid, alive. Katy, the main character, is...wait for it....A BLOGGER! Katy loves to read and blog. She checks her comments, her follower count and films IMM vlogs! That just felt like a huge shout-out to the book bloggers of the world and made me totally love Katy. But that's not all I loved about her. She is independent, self-reliant and does not take any crap off of people (or aliens!). She's quick to call Daemon out on his crap and flip him the bird as she's walking away. What's more, she is a loyal friend. Katy holds the fates of her new friends and never once considers giving them up, even when her own life is at risk. 

One of Katy's new friends is Dee, the girl next door and sister to Daemon. Dee is completely, 
squish-ably, adorable. She is like a breath of fresh, drama-free air. Especially when compared to her brother. 

Daemon. Where to begin. Okay. You know those hot, sarcastic, can-be-a-real-jerk guys that we all know and love? For example, Jace from The Mortal Instruments series, or Adrian from Vampire Academy. Take everything you love, and what drives you crazy about those guys, and multiply that by 10. Or 20. Possibly 100. Are you picking up on what I'm saying here? For real. Daemon made me bonkers. Take a look at the cover of Obsidian. He's hot, right. Devastating. Who wouldn't want some of that? I wanted to like him. And he did have some nice moments in the first half of the book. But then he would do or say something that made me want to scream. He comes across as an arrogant, rude... ass hat. I actually tweeted Jennifer Armentrout at one point and said that ""I want to punch Daemon in the throat and make out with him, simultaneously"". Her response was, he would probably like that. I swear, I felt everything that Katy was feeling about him. I honestly wondered if there was any coming back for Daemon. 

There was. Like many tortured heroes, Daemon's startling behavior is explained by a look at his past. Once you know why Daemon is so guarded and hostile, you can start to understand his actions. And why he is so desperate to hang on to what's left, especially his sister. The sibling love between Daemon in Dee was so beautiful, it just broke my heart. 

Obsidian left me emotionally exhausted. I'm still reeling. And the ending? Evil"
750,"Obsidian (Lux, #1)",1620610078,Jennifer L. Armentrout,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Geo_Spin,"In case you didn't know, our main character Katy here is a book blogger. Awesomesauce, right? So I was hooked from the very first paragraph. She's a reader, she's from Gainesville FL, and she's sarcastic. Oh, and she sometimes fantasizes about punching people and considers being around children the perfect abstinence program. I liked her immediately. (Now don't get me wrong, I like children, as long as I can hand them back at the end of the day...)

Then there's Daemon. She really wasn't kidding about him being stab-worthy. In the first chapter of meeting him I already wanted to punch him in the teeth and gouge his eyes out with a rusty spoon. Frustrating. Insufferable. Asshat. Exactly the kind of guy we tell ourselves not to fall for and do it anyway (ladies, you know exactly what I mean). ""Beautiful face. Beautiful body. Horrible attitude. The holy trinity of hot boys."" I thought I was going to get mental whiplash from his mood swings. Yep, I wanted to punch him.

750,"Obsidian (Lux, #1)",1620610078,Jennifer L. Armentrout,Barnes and Noble,4.7,LittleReadRidingHood,"Well, I wasn't going to tell you they were aliens, but the product description did it for me. So now that is out-of-the-way. This is your typical YA book, angsty teens, love/hate relationships, and something forcing the two to work together and work through their mutual attraction. I have heard others relate it to Twilight, and not in a positive fashion. I can see where they are coming from. However, I disagree. The heroine, Katy, has a brain in her head, and is just fine being left alone. She doesn't feel lost without Daemon. These characters all actually have DEPTH and understandable MOTIVATIONS. They are not just magically attracted.

Daemon, however much I get his motivations, is a giant jerk. He is that super sexy, boy next door, with no filter between his brain and his mouth. Well, that's not entirely true, he knows exactly what he is saying and what effect it will have on Katy. But haven't we all had &quot;that guy&quot; that we were attracted to that wasn't exactly the nicest? If you say no, you are lying to yourself. But that's fine with me!

Katy doesn't just fawn all over him. She fights back. SHE IS NOT A PUSHOVER. Thank goodness. she gets back at him when and how she is able to. That scene in the cafeteria, I felt for her, and was then laughing at everyone else, even as I continued to feel protective of her. The one thing I didn't understand was her immediate friendship to Dee. She is just too bubbly and needy for me ... but maybe it is me because I wouldn't be friends with her from the get-go; too much energy for me. I am way too lazy for that. All in all, this book gets a solid 4 stars from me, and I will eagerly await the next installment, Onyx."

Adams uses humor in such a way that it not only adds to the enjoyment of the read, but actually advances the plot in some points, which is captivating to read. I tried to highlight all the best quotes in the book, and was left with a very long list.

752,"Crown of Midnight (Throne of Glass, #2)",1619630621,Sarah J. Maas,Barnes and Noble,4.8,PrettyInFiction,"Celaena Sardothian is back and more badass then ever in Crown of Midnight by Sarah J. Maas. My favorite thing about this series is how the world engulfs you and doesn't let you up until the very end. And not even then, because Maas knows just what information to dangle in front of you, knowing you'll be drooling for more.




For those of you who felt Throne of Glass could have used a bit more action, you'll be glad to hear that not only has the King's Champion finally got her assassin on, but also that the danger gets ratcheted up a notch too. And no one is safe.




Now onto the boys! You want to know why I'm Team Chaol? Chocolate cake. Seriously. Any guy who brings you chocolate cake on the worst night of your life is worthy of some major swoonage. These two have their problems in Crown of Midnight, but even in the midst of a fight, you can still see how much they care about each other. The romance in this book is hot, but at the same time, absolutely heartbreaking for everyone involved.




I won't lie, even though I'm solidly Team Chaol, Dorian is badass in this book. A lot of things change for him. I won't go into details, but I'll say this: By the end of the book, I was swaying towards Team Dorian, if not for Celaena, than at least for myself! Although, I really enjoyed reading the Celaena/Dorian scenes throughout Crown of Midnight, much more than I did in the first (which might be because the love triangle plot has been somewhat dissolved in this one). They make a really good team and it's fun to read about, even if you're worried for their lives most of the time.




The only negative thing I can even think to say about Crown of Midnight is that, for most of the book&mdash;like, maybe the middle 50 percent&mdash;the characters are all keeping major secrets from each other. Now, I get why they kept some of those secrets, but for people who claim to love each other so much, they certainly don't seem to trust each other. At all. It seemed to me like the plot dragged a little because of all this secret keeping, especially around the middle. But that's not to say the story wasn't still an action packed page turner, because it was. But there were a few times when I felt the plot could have been rushed along a little.




Crown of Midnight is one of those exceptional sequels that outshines the first book in nearly every way. Which is saying a lot since I loved Throne of Glass. If you had your problems with Throne of Glass, give this book a chance, I bet you'll love it. And if you haven't started this series yet, what are you waiting for? With a brilliantly thought out fantasy world with magic, fae, a thoroughly evil villain, and a heroine who is the perfect mix between strong and vulnerable, this is a series every fantasy lover needs to own. Not to mention the boys. Oh, the boys."
752,"Crown of Midnight (Throne of Glass, #2)",1619630621,Sarah J. Maas,Barnes and Noble,4.8,BlkosinerBookBlog,"Given it has been a bit from reading Throne of Glass, honestly all I remember was that I loved it, Celaena was kick ass and I adored her, and there was a love triangle that I liked and I think I was rooting for the underdog. All my recollection from before I began, but it quickly came back to me. 
   Celaena is tough, smart and witty, and I admired her. She goes about everything in such a calculated manner, and she has this ability to see and treasure the good, and have no limits for injustice. I couldn't believe but thought it was exactly like her in the ways that she was defying the king. I knew that she was walking a very narrow road, but admired her all the same. I honestly had forgotten about the Elena theme from the last one, but it also emerged in this one, and I enjoyed that storyline as it challened Celaena even more. 
    I loved Chaol even more in this one. It is becoming apparent to even Dorian how much he cares for Celaena, and he can't stand it when she is off on the dangerous missions for the king. He wants to protect her and wishes that the line drawn by his position and hers wasn't there. But I lived for their stolen moments, of how steamy it can even be for him to just hold her. It is touching how he cares for her so much he just wants to throw caution to the wind, but I am glad that he is smart about it. 
    Dorian was present in this one, but thankfully wasn't really a factor into the triangle like in the first, but he is there as a friend to Celeana when she needs one the most. He stepped up in many ways, but still has a long way to grow as royalty. But he is harboring a secret in this one that I had no inkling would happen, but it means big things. 
    I will say that Sarah almost made me cry, and def shocked me at some of the turn of events that happened. There were so many twists in this one, things that I never saw coming, and that I am still even at the end, not sure exactly what the implications will be but I know that I can't wait to find out. The climax and ending left me breathless and wanting more from this beautifully written novel with so many layers. 
    




Bottom Line: Layered and exciting 2nd book of a series with an awesome and dangerous female main character."
752,"Crown of Midnight (Throne of Glass, #2)",1619630621,Sarah J. Maas,Barnes and Noble,4.8,Tween_2_Teen_Book_Reviews,"Crown of Midnight was spectacular. The first book, Throne of Glass, was one of my all-time favorite books, but this managed to top it, easily. See my review of Throne of Glass here. When reading the reviews by bloggers before it came out, I didn't get what was SO great about this book, but having picked it up and read it, I can't disagree with them. Crown of Midnight is perfect in every way. It has amazing character development, a perfect plot arc, and a cliffhanger at the ending that has left me hungering for book three!




The main character is Celeana Sardothian. She's an assassin in a mythical land known Erilea. As of the beginning of the book, Celeana works for the twisted and evil king of Adarlan. When I started book one, I knew something was special about Celeana. On page 85, I realized just how special she was. I had fantasies about Celeana that I was almost positive wouldn't happen, but oh, they happened. She's good at keeping secrets, even from herself. Celeana's past has always been a bit of a mystery, but this book sheds more light on the topic then ever before. The truth comes trickling out through secrets and lies. Romance is an important aspect of the book, but more often than not, I wasn't quite feeling the spark. In book one, there was a love triangle between Celeana, crown prince Dorian, and Chaol, Captain of the Guard. It's more or less solved in this book, but I keep wanting more. As readers know, previous to the series, Celeana had a boyfriend named Sam who was killed right before she was arrested. The ideal ending romantically for me, would be that Dorian and Chaol were put to the side and Sam was brought back from the dead. I honestly loved that boy, and his character feels too rich and deep just to kill off after four novellas. The characters don't end! There's also Princess Nehemia. She's Celeana's best friend and closest confident. She's a rebellious girl and hates the king for attacking her people. When the worst happens, and disrupts all of their lives, the characters still manage to heal and heal fast. Not once to they hold back, mess up, or go to slow. And by the end of the story, Celeana has realized what she is willing to fight for, her past, her family, her kingdom, herself.




Sarah J. Maas was tasked with the responsibility of created an entire new world, full of possibilities and people. She does this amazingly, effortlessly weaving in side-plots and backstories for characters only mentioned or to come. Events occur that readers know will have repercussions and can't wait to see. Your characters pain is our gain, as they say. The book flows from one page or another until, before I know it, I've somehow already finished the book. I flew threw these pages, not once stopping for anything. The book is so amazing, words simply can't describe it. A world has been born, people, and as each person picks it up and discovers it, this world will grow more and more. I love this book and am super excited to meet Sarah herself this afternoon! I give this book five stars!"

However, I've found myself on a serious comic kick, and the Pilgrim comics are some of the first I've picked up thus far. This first little volume, Precious Little Life, offers plenty to the reader. There's plenty of humor and charm within the characters. The banter is witty and effortless. The illustrations are well drawn and, fortunately, don't take themselves seriously. The characters are almost always likable, and by the end of these comics, guys will want to find their own Ramona Flowers. Scott is your typical young adult who goes through the vanilla trials and tribulations of a modern man, with a twist. His friends offer little in the way of support, instead choosing witty banter to somehow make Scott feel better. Even the bad guy is a decent character, even if we don't see very much of him. All in all, Scott Pilgrim's Precious Little Life is a great start to a fantastic series. It takes less than an hour to read, but it's well worth it."

I don't think I would have liked it as much if it didn't have the humor it had. I thought that it was pretty mature and should only be read by children in upper grade levels and teenagers. I also found that the style of graphic novels can be a bit difficult to read sometimes.Classroom Extension Ideas:1.

Have the students review the book and tell whether or not they can relate to any part of the story in some way."
754,Half Broke Horses,1416586288,Jeannette Walls,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Allison_Davis,"We follow the life of Lily Casey Smith, born in a dugout in Texas in 1901. A larger than life character with more gumption and common sense than are usually bestowed upon one person, Lily is not only a survivor of hard times, but she learns how to come out ahead when faced with adversity. Not one to feel sorry for herself, she has no use for weak people (or interest in what other people think of her). Lily overcomes a poor childhood in what was basically a dysfunctional family, a first marriage to a bigamist, and a lack of education (to name just a few of the problems she dealt with). Her second marriage, her children, and the ranch make up most of the story. I definitely recommend checking this out. Another book that you must read if you're a fan of Jeannette Walls, Augusten Burroughs, or memoirs in general (make sure you start reading it early because you won't sleep until you've finished it!) is ""I LOVE YOUS ARE FOR WHITE PEOPLE."""

Although it doesn't matter which you read first, I would recommend reading HBH before GC as it gives perspective on the background of this strange but fascinating family. Walls writes with candor and humor and certainly captures the spirit of her grandmother and the time period of the wild west. This is a vibrant biography-cum-novel of her spunky grandmother living in the olden days who was a womens' libber before it became fashionable to be one. Highly recommended."
754,Half Broke Horses,1416586288,Jeannette Walls,Barnes and Noble,3.9,WaryDreamer,"Not a bad narrative regarding life of an amazing pioneer. While there was nothing to rivet the reader in the way of a plot, it gave insight to the struggles of life as the 1800's gave way to the 1900's and how things changed by mid-century. It was an interesting read. 

Perhaps it had special meaning to me because my own parents (as children) settled in the SE corner of New Mexico prior to statehood. The tales of ranching in a desert area rang true. While in today's world, it's inconceivable to allow a teenager to head ""that direction"" for 500 miles, my dad told similar stories and this narrative helped me to understand his eye-opening tales were more the norm for the day. It was a time when babies left infancy and practically entered adulthood with very little chance of childhood in the middle; a time when survival required using your wits with very little margin for error; a time when your word was your bond and a handshake was a contract."

I really, REALLY loved this book!  The characters are strong and memorable and the plot is not so predictable that you have everything figured out by the time you get half way into the book.  Meghan is a likable main character with deep love for her family even though her childhood conditions were not the best.  Her best friend is a rock for her, even though he turns out to be someone that shocks her.  There is the bad guy romance factor with Ash.  I have to say one of my favorite characters is the cat! Yes, the cat, Grimalkin...he is funny and also there as a rock when Meghan needs him.


The author's imagination was transferred vividly to the pages of this book and I was flipping pages like crazy to get to the end!

Although the plot of the book resembled that of the Faeriwalker trilogy by Jenna Black (Glimmerglass, Shadowspell, and Sirensong), with many of the same characters, there was a fresh feel  of the book with the addition of the Iron King and his followers. Meghan Chase, the main character can be a little annoying at some parts, always having to be saved by Puck or Ash. Meghann does end up prooving herself more towards the end of the book. One thing that was left a bit unclear was how her and her friends always escape from some sticky situations. For example, blacking out and then being safe. One thing I also really enjoyed the typical love triangle: bad boy/enemy or best friend she knew forever? (I am team Ash. I like his mysterious nature, and also that he does want to be with Meghan even though it seems the other way around early in the book. THE ENDING IS A CLIFFHANGER, SO NOW I HAVE TO BUY THE NEXT ONE IMMEDIATLY!! Any fantasy lover will really enjoy this book! Totally deserves 5 stars!!!!"

The fast paced action keeps the page turning, but it is also a great love story. One of my favorites!!"
757,Lonesome Dove,067168390X,Larry McMurtry,Barnes and Noble,4.7,sootfoot5,"There are these rare books that a person will read over and over because the characters become a true part of that person's lives.  This is one of those books.  I have probably read this book 20 times yet I glean something new from it each time.  I can perhaps feel the prairie wind more strongly in my face or better understand Lori's pain as she is tortured by her kidnappers. Oh, there are so many little nuances that make this book the best book ever written.

Yes, the mini series is truly wonderful.  It is my favorite movie just as this is my favorite book.  And yet, that production doesn't hold a candle to the book.  The thought processes of the charactrs just can't be captured in a movie, and it is those thought processes that  make this book truly great.  Because while we have two main characters and numerous primary supporting characters, McMurtury is able to concisely yet with perfection allow every character in this book be a real character either by their actions or through their thougts.  Since the movie can not capture much of these thoughts, a great deal of the beauty of the work is lost. 

The story is simple enough - it is a story of a journey - and yet it is more than that for it is not just the story of a physical journey, but a story of individual journeys the characters take to experience their own growth.  It is a story of enlightenment.  And the reader closes the book at the end feeling completely enlightened and ready to start the journey again for another enlightenment lesson."

758,Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers,0393324826,Mary Roach,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"My most difficult decision came in 1961   when my husband and I donated our full   term, first born, anencephalic baby, for   scientific research. The doctors said   everything was perfect except it had a   profoundly absent brain. They knew very   little because it wasn't a common   occurrence, and was even less common   to get an opportunity to studying it in   depth. They told us that anencephally   occurs very early in pregnancy, was   caused by nothing we could control, had   never happened to the same woman   twice, that the baby couldn't perform   rudimentary life supporting functions,   death was imminent, and last rites were   performed in the delivery room. Both a   nun and a doctor asked us to consider   releasing the body for scientific research.   Feeling that if I could help prevent   another, even if just one, new mother   from feeling this kind of hurt, then our   experience wouldn't be in vain. So when   the baby expired, I immediately turned it's   body over for research and I gave as   much as I could to the March of Dimes. I   did these things in hopes that another   woman would not have to face what I had.   I've cried many times because some   people either didn't understand or thought   my decision implied I didn't love or want   my baby with all my heart, but I know I   made the right decision. After   having read Mary Roach's book I am   convinced she has insight regarding the   need to help others in a way that I do, one   that is still not readily accepted nor talked   about nearly enough. I do think the last   chapter was a bit weaker than the rest of   the book and although I love humor, the   last part should have ended on a more   serious note."

Yes, it is a nonfiction and it can get a little bit long at some points; but if you stick with it you'll learn so many cool facts the average joe could've never imagined. It answers all those questions you were asking yourself at the last familial funeral. It cures all the curiosities of death, its history, and its future. It is a book that everyone should read at least once! It was the book that helped me decide I wanted to become a pathologist. It was so fascinating and weird I didn't want to put the book down!!"
758,Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers,0393324826,Mary Roach,Barnes and Noble,4.4,WY-RALP2,"This book was about the author travling to different parts of the world to understand what people do with different parts of a dead body. This book is full of information and fun, but weird, facts. I enjoyed reading this book because I learned more from it then I thought I was going to. One thing that I found interesting was how people's cells can still react to their emotions even when they are not in the body. They did an experiment where they took some siliva from a patient. They then analyze the cells and how they reacted with the emotions from the patient. Later, the patient was 50 miles away from the lab and was watching a horror movie. The cells still reacted to his emotions even from being that far apart. To me that seemed pretty amazing and is one of the reasons why I enjoyed reading this book. Overall, this was a fun and exciting book to read and I recommened it to anyone who's curious about the human body."
759,"Bloodlines (Bloodlines, #1)",1595143173,Richelle Mead,Barnes and Noble,4.6,skyla11377,"When The Vampire Academy series ended I was sad because I really LOVED those books and got really invested in Rose and Dimitri. When I found out there was a spin-off series I was so excited and couldn't wait to get to read it. Now, I am not going to lie, at first, when I found out the series was focused on the Alchemist Sydney Sage I was a bit disappointed because I was hoping for maybe a story about Lissa and Christian or maybe a book about Adrian Ivashkov and his soul mate. Disappointment soon turned to enrapture, not only did I get my wish (in a way) by having Adrian in this new series but we also got to see some familiar faces like Eddie Castile, Jill ""jailbait"" Dragomir, Abe Mazur, Rose Hathaway, Dimitri Belikov, and Sonya Karp. This book kept me glued from beginning to end. It was actually kool seeing things from Sydney's perspective and getting to know what it is like for her to be an alchemist. I loved how this book had a touch of the Moroi/Dhampir dynamic that I was used to, as well as, a new setting and new situations that kept this book new and familiar all at the same time. Sydney really comes into her own and starts to find her voice in this book. She starts to learn that not everything has to be so regimental and strict. There can be a grey area which can leave her some leeway to be the kind of person she wants to be and not the kind she is expected to be. She always feels she has to walk a fine line between the alchemist way of life and the Vampire world. We also get to see how what Rose did, affects Adrian in this book. The last series all we really saw was the devil may care side of Adrian, but in Bloodlines, we get to see his tortured soul and how he copes with losing his love Rose to another guy. We get some more time with Jill and Eddie which is great too. We get a glimpse into the life of the reluctant princess Jill a.k.a. jailbait (to Adrian). Eddie gets to show us more of his guardian side. So many things happen in this book but I am so afraid to spoil it for anyone who hasn't read this book or The Vampire Academy Series. This book has it all: redemption, danger, death(s), a mystery, first love, unrequited love, enemies, magic, Vampires, mean girls, jocks, etc.... You name it and I bet this book has it....^_^. On a scale from 1-10 I give Bloodlines a 20. Yes, it is off my scale but it is such a great start to this new spin-off series. Richelle really has another runaway hit on her hands, in my opinion. If you are a fan of The Vampire Academy Series you NEED to get this book. If you are new to Richelle Mead you NEED to get to know her Vampires. On your way to picking up Bloodlines you should also pick up Vampire Academy (book #1), Frostbite (book #2), Shadow Kiss (book #3), Blood Promise (book #4), Spirit Bound (book #5), and Last Sacrifice (book #6) in The Vampire Academy Series. Trust me that series and this book will not disappoint."

760,"Ender's Shadow (Ender's Shadow, #1)",0765342405,Orson Scott Card,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"Orson Scott Card has created another master piece in his novel, Ender¿s Shadow.  This parallel to Ender¿s Game is remarkably intriguing in the different perspectives and interpretations of Ender Wiggin and the development of Bean.  You are taken on a journey through a boy¿s life who acted Ender¿s right hand man in Ender¿s Game.  Bean, as he is nicknamed, is a homeless child with nothing but violence and his need for learning accompanying him.  Because of his diminutive physicality, he must overcome many situations using only his wits.  Personally I felt that this novel was a close second to Ender¿s Game, although many people may disagree.  Much more action and inner conflict took place in Ender¿s Game, and I feel that it was, personally, easier to relate to.  However, it is still very interesting to see how the much smarter, but more petite ¿shadow of Ender¿ endures his life, and how Ender is portrayed from a different perspective.  His deprived childhood makes this book easy to get into, while his perseverance and advance intellectual mind, as well as the many situations he encounters in Battle School, makes this very easy to continue.  Even if you have never heard of the book Ender¿s Game, this book is still very interesting and very easy to follow.  I would definitely recommend this book to fans of Sci-Fi, and people who just feel like reading a good book."

761,Twenties Girl,0385342020,Sophie Kinsella,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Jessi-21,"Twenties Girl: I love the Shopaholic series, and I've read all of her other novels. Twenties Girl is definitely right up there for me as far as Sohie Kinsella goes. It was fun, believable (if you believe :O)) and funny! I enjoyed Lara and Sadie both, and genuinely felt the connection between the two as friends.
On a more serious note, I thought it was wonderful how Lara had never known this person, never bothered with her, then learned so much about her when she met her ghost. It's sad because the older generation is out there, and they hold so much history, and they are so often forgotten about.
Searching for Sadie's necklace only brought her into Lara's life...everything else that came after is where the real story was.
Sophie Kinsella has never disappointed me and she is one of the few authors I will go out and buy as soon as her books are in stock. I absolutely thought this was a fantastic story, and it very much had Sophie Kinsella's touch. I highly recommend it."
761,Twenties Girl,0385342020,Sophie Kinsella,Barnes and Noble,4.2,kuhlcat,"Sophie Kinsella always entertains me with her novels. I walked with Becky Bloomwood to all the shops in the ""Shopaholic"" series, I went along on Lexi's adventures of amnesia in ""Remember Me?"", and I laughed as Samantha goes from being an office flunky to an amateur housekeeper in ""The Undomestic Goddess"". I was thrilled to see this book, ""Twenties Girl"", in the library as a quick read and snatched it right up.

And there was no false advertising. This was a quick read. I was at the library on Thursday, and closed the book after the final chapter today, Tuesday, only 5 days later. I loved it. I devoured it. It was a great way to distract me from any stress or any other issues going on in my life. I needed a quick, light, entertaining read, and Sophie indulged me.

Her characters are just so easy to relate to. I don't know what that says about my life, but it's true. And adding a ghost to the crazy mix was an adventure that I just couldn't pass up. Lara and Sadie make a great pair. Two completely different viewpoints and generations thrown together in one erratic enterprise. Something new happened with each page turn and I was so excited to find out what happened next throughout the whole novel. I love books like this.

I admit it proudly: I love chick lit. Life can be so stressful and ridiculous that it's nice to sit and relax with an easy read and a cup of coffee (or tea, depending on your preference). And if Sophie Kinsella isn't the queen of chick lit, then she should be. All of her books are great, and I recommend any of them."

This one was different though.  Still fun, but the story was deeper.  It was very original.  The main characters Lara and Sadie were well developed and there was such an emotional connection between them.  I laughed (out loud) and cried.   I did not want this story to end!!  Tally ho Sadie - I miss you already!"

(I CONFESS I HAVE A WEAK SPOT FOR WWII MOVIES/BOOKS/ETC.)  HOWEVER, I CAN THINK OF NO MOVIE THAT MORE ACCURATELY AND POIGNANTLY CONVEYS THE PAIN AND SUFFERING OF THOSE TIMES.  THE ONLY THING IT LACKED WAS SHOWING THE SCALE OF THE TRAGEDY---WHICH NO MOVIE COULD EVER DO.  THIS SHOULD BE REQUIRED VIEWING FOR ALL SCHOOL STUDENTS.  THERE ARE FEW MOVIES THAT SHOW THE INHERENT DIGNITY OF SOME PEOPLE AND THE UNBELIEVABLE CRUELTY OF OTHERS.  ESPECIALLY, HOW THE EVIL IN SOME PEOPLE CAN BRING OUT THE HIDDEN GREATNESS OF OTHERS."

763,The Bluest Eye,0452287065,Toni Morrison,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"This is a great piece in American literature.  What I'm having a difficult time with is why there are so many young 'adults' complaining about the violent/graphic nature of the book. It amazes me that a fantastic, socially concious piece of literature, is considered to be offensive for being sexually graphic, especially when our culture is saturated with sex and violence.  What bothers me, even more than critically unjustifiable opinions, is that teens are completely caught off guard by sexual and violent material that doesnt contain slap-stick humor and apple pies. This book may be 'graphic', but it isnt gratuitous.  If you're focusing so much on the 'graphic' content, you've completely missed the point that Morrison was trying to make."
763,The Bluest Eye,0452287065,Toni Morrison,Barnes and Noble,4.1,lesia_trayonna2012,"Toni Morrison's spectacular, mind blowing, phenomenal classic, is an eye opening realistic adventure about people who hoped and dreamed for something huge to change their life; something to make them bigger, better, stronger, more powerful, and above everybody else. This book was splendid. It was descriptive, and suspenseful. It tells the story of a young girl's inexhaustible journey to feel beautiful, her courage to want more than anybody else like her has ever had, and the will to do it at any cost. 

Little Pecola Breedlove's one and only marvel is to have blue eyes so she will be loved, not just any common blue eyes.the bluest. She comes from a broken family, her father is an alcoholic, her mother is distant, and her brother runs away often. Cholly, her father, never knew his mother or father, and was raised by an aunt until she died. He was found having sex for the first time by two white men and was greatly embarrassed. When he goes on a search for his father, he was frightened, for the man was greatly uncouth. Paulina, her mother, had an ugly foot due to stepping on a nail when she was younger, causing her to have a permanent limp. No person has every paid attention to her. Pecola's family is the talk of the town; people find their misery an entertaining story. Pecola believes she is ugly, and every one else thinks so to, and wants to be like Shirley Temple because she believes she is beautiful; beautiful because she has blue eyes. Pecola's father tried to burn their house down, so she temporarily visits her only friends Claudia and Frieda MacTeer. That is just the beginning for young Pecola, one day Cholly returns home and finds Pecola washing dishes and he rapes her; therefore Pecola becomes pregnant. Her mother does not believe that Cholly raped her and almost beats her to death. Nobody wants and/or expects her baby to live, nobody except Claudia and Frieda. Claudia and Frieda plant Marigolds, and if they grow Pecola will have her baby. During that time Pecola goes to see a man name Soaphead Church, he is known to work miracles; her only request is the bluest eyes. His only response is ""'I am not a magician.' 'If He wants your wish is granted, He will do it.'"". 

 Toni Morrison has an interesting way of bringing out Pecola's role; she is very opinionated for instance she says ""They fight this battle all the way to the grave. The laugh that is a little too loud; the enunciation a little too round; the gesture a little too serious."" She was speaking of her neighbors, and she doesn't think they are the best looking and/or the best behaved people in the world. Which is surprisingly ironic, because neither is Pecola. Morrison is also very descriptive, even when simply describing a dog ""The dog was mangy; his exhausted eyes ran with a sea-green matter around which gnats and flies clustered."" And ""The dog gagged, his mouth chomping the air, and promptly fell down. He tried to raise himself, could not, tried again and half-fell down the steps. Choking, stumbling, he moved like a broken toy around the yard."" 

I highly recommend this book for anyone, not only does it touch basis with a lot of issues that occur to this very day, it tells a story; a story of how a young girl even yearns to be treasured, cared for, and to incorporate. A story of how anybody will passionately go after what they desire."
763,The Bluest Eye,0452287065,Toni Morrison,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Nitzan,This is a short book but is very heavy. You cannot read through it in one sitting because the content of each chapter just hits you in the gut. It is defiantly not a light read but is very touching. Great for book clubs because there is so much to talk about.
764,"The White Queen (The Plantagenet and Tudor Novels, #2)",1416563687,Philippa Gregory,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"I've always thoroughly enjoyed Phillipa Gregory's fabulous historical novels. Ms. Gregory's last series about the Tudors included such titles as ""The Constant Princess"", ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" (remember the great movie from this book?!), ""The Boleyn Inheritance"" &""The Other Queen"" - plus there were two other books that completed this series. Ms. Gregory claims that a chance ""taster"" history class at the University of Sussex started her on the road to penning her lush, well researched books. The only thing that my history classes in college did were to strengthen my passion for both history (history minor) & reading about history - both fiction and non-fiction. I love to read books in a series because they allow you to really develop a good feel for the subjects & the time period. One of the things I enjoy doing when I am reading historical fiction is to research the true facts - people, places, dates - you get the idea. I like to see how far a writer goes to weave a tale around the truth. Ms Gregory generally writes fiction with a strong non-fiction base to which she adds just a pinch of plausible fiction to round out the story. Highly recommended! Get this book!"
764,"The White Queen (The Plantagenet and Tudor Novels, #2)",1416563687,Philippa Gregory,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Oscar_Aguilar,"I have been anxiously awaiting the new Philippa Gregory book THE WHITE QUEEN. Like many, I enjoyed THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL; however, I didn't exactly love the last book that I read by Ms. Gregory. I was sincerely hoping that THE WHITE QUEEN would love up to all its advance billing. 

While I definitely enjoy historical fiction, I am sadly lacking in knowledge about England and its Monarchy. As a result, I knew almost nothing about the Plantagenets except for a few small things that appeared as side stories in other novels. I can't tell you how much of this story is fact versus fiction; and frankly, I don't even care. I was fascinated by the story Ms. Gregory told about these characters' lives. THE WHITE QUEEN is better than any televised drama or movie I've ever seen. These characters are smart, determined, and ruthless; and I just loved reading about them.

I thought THE WHITE QUEEN had a little bit of everything; and I'm sure there is something in Elizabeth Woodville' s story that will capture your attention. First, THE WHITE QUEEN is just a fabulous historical story about the Cousins' War. There are so many scenes where brother is pitted against brother for control; and the characters involved have absolutely no idea who they can and can not trust. It was a great, suspenseful ride for the reader too! I also thoroughly enjoyed how Ms. Gregory used facts to tell the story while also embellishing the mysteries and holes in the characters' lives to make a very readable story. 

Another part of this story that will keep many readers entertained is the magical and sorcery elements. Elizabeth is said to be the descendant of a mythical water creature called Melusina. Ms. Gregory incorporated the myth of Melusina into the novel and actually used it as a recurring theme/symbol throughout the story. In addition, Elizabeth's mother practiced some examples witchcraft. Some people actually claimed that Elizabeth's mother put a spell on Edward to make him fall in love with her daughter. 

One of my favorite elements of the THE WHITE QUEEN was the love story angle. It seemed to me as if there was a perfect blend of romance and history in this book. Not only did THE WHITE QUEEN show the love affair between Elizabeth and Edward, but this book is also demonstrated the love between mothers and their children. More than once, I was amazed by what women did to protect their children especially in the case of Elizabeth and her sons.

THE WHITE QUEEN would make an excellent book club pick. In fact, if your group enjoys historical fiction like mine does, then you should definitely consider this book in the very near future. One added bonus is that the book is around 400 pages (shorter than many historical novels), and it is not at all overwhelming in scope. There is a great reading guide with fifteen questions that really allow you to delve into Elizabeth's life and her actions.

Another recent read that was just outstanding that you should definitely give a look was I Love Yous Are for White People."
764,"The White Queen (The Plantagenet and Tudor Novels, #2)",1416563687,Philippa Gregory,Barnes and Noble,3.9,harstan,"Everyone is shocked when twenty-seven years old widow Elizabeth Woodville Grey marries the newly crowned King Edward IV; five years younger than her.  He is the House of York while she is the House of Lancaster.  With a twist, her family becomes his greatest loyalist backers while his brother George and his advisor Warwick unite in duplicity to steal the throne.  A third family of cousins the Tudors wait in the wings while encouraging both sides in the dispute.  The War of the Roses begins with the ascension of THE WHITE ROSE as queen.

The key to this super historical fiction is not the often told tale of changing loyalties or heated trysts (a Philippa Gregory norm), but the speculation into Edward and Elizabeth's two sons, the lost princes placed in the Tower by their Uncle Richard.  Clearly researched in great depth, Ms Gregory makes her case plausible based on accepted facts.  Fans will enjoy the epic WHITE QUEEN as history comes alive, but it is the speculative history that makes this a triumph worth reading amidst a sea of novels as cousins go to war with ironically the long term victor being the third family Tudor.

765,The Autobiography of Malcolm X,0345350685,"Malcolm X, Alex Haley",Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"I am a high school sophomore that had a research project for my english class. I personally chose Malcolm X because I have always
wanted to learn about him and how inspiring he is for people of color that want to stand up for themselves from racism. I thought this book 
was very helpful with the questions that I had to answer and it was very well written. It told me about his whole life and how he began to 
become the way he ended up. It talks about from him growing up from an innocent young man living in Lansing, Michigan with a 
widowed mother, to dropping out of school and hustling on the streets of Chicago and Harlem, then to jail realizing his fate with the 
Nation of Islam, and finally to a new leader for the African American race.This book helped me open my eyes on how African Americans 
feel/felt and how badly they were treated by white people but they still looked up to them. Since I am part black, this book made me have 
some thoughts that I have never had before about his beliefs. More than just a couple of times I agreed with him because I still see the 
issues he talks about when some white people are still thinking they're superior to people of color. It has made a huge impact on me 
because it changed the way I think and the way I act. I very much recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning the true 
feelings and thoughts of Malcolm X."

Born in Omaha, Nebraska (a city not really known for its African American culture) Malcolm Little and his family were forced to leave after a confrontation with the KKK.

As a young man barely able to read or write, Malcolm becomes a theif, a hustler and eventually a prisoner. While in prison he becomes mesmerized by the teachings of a man called Elijah Mohammed, head of the Nation of Islam, a religious sect of Islam that caters to the plight of African Americans during the mid 20th Century.

After reading his way through what was effectively a Ph.D in prison, Malcolm becomes the number two man in the Nation of Islam and the most rhetorical voice of social change in America- an honor that would cause him to be demonized by Whites and Blacks alike.

Published posthumously,(Malcolm X was assassinated in 1965 by members of the Nation of Islam who most likely cohorts of the FBI) this book is definitive work on race realtions without it being a text book per se. It also inspired the author, Alex Haley, to write his most famous novel Roots."

It gives you a different perspective on politics, crime, religion and history. This is not a piece to which one has to agree. As a matter of fact, it is not a piece by which one has to abide by the standards therein. Rather, this is a work of art that compels to reader to indulge in the lost art of thinking.

Well Volume 1: Preludes and Nocturnes is definitely the place to start. This volume follows Dream of the Endless as he is mistakenly captured by a group of men trying to capture his sister Death. He escapes and is royally ticked. At this point in Sandman's life Neil Gaiman was still trying to find it's voice. Does he want it to have a big part in DC mythos? (John Constantine and Arkham Asylum play roles here) Does he want it to be a horror series? (A bit of blood in this one). Due to this the first stories are somewhat hit and miss, but they play their role in introducing Dream to the reader. That being said, Sandman finally finds it's voice in the final story of this volume- ""The Sound of Her Wings"".WOW. ""The Sound of Her Wings"" is an absolutely beautiful story. Perfect! So basically regardless of how you feel about the others, if you enjoy the final story, Sandman is probably for you."

767,Seabiscuit: An American Legend,0345465083,Laura Hillenbrand,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"I happened upon this book by mere coincidence and only read it to get in the good graces of my English teacher who was unleashing a vicious wrath on those who disagreed with her book choices. She handed it to me with high reccomendations. With my gradess at stake, I struggled to maintain focus during the first few pages of interminable facts, but soon fell in love with the gripping tale of a quiet trainer, a garralous owner, and horse with both character and a huge heart.
You don't need to be an animal lover to enjoy this enthralling tale though it helps.
While this reccomendation may not have moved you, I hope that you will give this wonderful book a chance as my ability in writing reviews, this being my first, does not in any way reflect the ability of Laura Hillenbrand's amazing story telling ability."

767,Seabiscuit: An American Legend,0345465083,Laura Hillenbrand,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"In Laura Hillenbrand's heartening tale one horse lifts the country as he races to unlikely victories. The novel tells the tale of Seabiscuit, a doubted horse that despite all of his setbacks, rises and becomes, arguably, the best race horse of the century. All adding a dash of depth, Hillenbrand, connects us to the characters of, Tom Smith the quiet and wise trainer, Red Pollard the blind battered jockey, and the owner; a charming self made man, Charles Howard. It is inevitable the personal connection made with all the characters, but the connection to Seabiscuit even makes non-horse lovers fall in love with his comedic and stubborn personality. Hillenbrand brilliantly intertwines the hardships and poverty of the country with the main theme of perseverance to overcome. Using imagery, Hillenbrand, portrays the toll that racing had on not only Seabiscuit, but also his main jockey Red. As the horse and jockey became more beaten throughout the story their importance, perseverance, and unbreakable bond only grew greater. The novel also yields the message of teamwork and the importance of taking risks. As the economy crashed Howard's growing business as a car repairman halted and he, like so many other Americans, questioned what to do. Following his interest in the dying sport of horse racing he purchased Seabiscuit, the son of Hardtack (a miraculous race horse). With the combination of Seabiscuit, Red Pollard, and Tom Smith, Charles Howard hoped victory would proceed. Working as a team the unlikely horse rose to greatness, demonstrating that risks and hard work are essential to the success of any feat large or small. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, with the exception of the small portion of dry writing in the beginning, and I would indefinitely recommend this book to someone. It tells an uplifting and touching story of perseverance, relationships, and victory, that anyone would enjoy reading. Other inspirational novels such as Secretariat and Man O' War would be great additional reads to Seabiscuit. In 1938 every stride Seabiscuit made towards victory captured the hearts of Americans and now through every page of this novel he is capturing more."

As soon as I got started I couldn't stop. Dennis Lehane does an amazing job of keeping the reader entertained all the way through. This book is great for anybody who like books that could be adapted into suspenseful movies. Not going to give away the story but trust me, if you make it to the end of the book (and it shouldn't be that hard to do) than you will be in for a shock as the ending ties everything together in a way you will never see coming."
768,Shutter Island,038073186X,Dennis Lehane,Barnes and Noble,4.2,jmpman44,"This is my first Dennis Lehane book, and after reading it I'm sure it won't be my last. The book itself is self-sustaining though out. I started it one morning and read it all day, only breaking to eat and go to the gym. It's that good! It starts off and grabs you with the mystery of what Shutter Island is really all about and gets your brain churning trying to figure out what the truth really is and why people seem to be hiding it. The setting is creepy and at times down right unsettling, and the characters are all well developed. Through his words, Mr. Lehane allows us to see Shutter Island exactly they way he wants us to, and weaves his plot at a pace that is absolutely perfect; always giving you just enough to keep you wanting more. If you like suspense, mystery, and things a little dark and creepy, you must read this book."

However this novel, although tightly written, is trying too hard to be that 6th sense type. It failed for me! I saw the ending 1/3 into the book and kept reading hoping I'll be wrong. If you really want to read a great ""People on a small island cut-off from others"" novel read Agatha Cristie's ""And Then There Were None."" You will NOT see the ending coming... Unless you read the last chapter first :)"
769,The Complete Sherlock Holmes,0553328255,Arthur Conan Doyle,Barnes and Noble,4.3,J_A_Dennis,"I bought my copy of this publication 35 years ago. In that time I have enjoyed reading through the many adventures numerous times.This publication is the most complete, and most authentic compilation of the original works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle that I have seen. No frills, no pretensive illustrations or pictures, no clever attempts to interpret or explain the content. It is the written work, as it was originally written by the Master Story-Teller. The printed page is all that is needed to spark the imagination and stimulate the mind. And Boy-O-Boy does it deliver!!So effective are Conan Doyle's literary methods that many people, at one time or another, thought of Sherlock Holmes as a historical figure, a real person. In fact, the master of ""Deductive Reasoning"", as presented by the author, established methodology that was previously unheard of. Eventually these ideas became the basis for much of modern day detective work.The stories are captivating, stimulating and exciting. Visual images and ""What-If"" mental paradoxes jump from the page to the mind with seamless interface. So convincing are the arguments and conclusions of Mr. Holmes, these tails, filled with pure, indisputable logic and deductive reasoning leave one in a frame of mind to question everything that fails to fit into a logical realistic pattern or solution. I'm telling you, this is powerful stuff and if you're not careful it can change your way of looking at things. It surely has done that to me. For me, this is a positive thing. You will need to decide for yourself.The publication is well made, although not truly archival in quality. Overall product quality is mediocre at best. The paper is average quality, but heavier than most. The print it durable and well done, although font size is on the small side. No doubt necessary for including the entire, unabridged compilation into a single volume. The cover is stout and durable, although the binding on mine has partially parted in a few places. None-the-less, it is still very much intact, and very much one of my favorites.My copy is thirty-five years old, read through several times, and yet, after all of these years is is still in good condition. The page ends were left un-trimmed, giving it a unique, vintage look. Makes it more special to me. Newer additions are much more neatly put together and finished. I paid $8.95 for it 35 years ago. At under $30 today, this publication is a great bargain. I highly recommend it to any true Sherlock Holmes officianado, or any one who may like to become one.No where in the collective adventures of Sherlock Holmes did he ever say, ""Elementary My Dear Watson"". That was an erroneous tag foisted on the worlds greatest ""Consulting Detective"" by the money grubbing movie moguls of Hollywierd.He did, however, say, (and I parraphrase): ""When you remove all other possibilities, whatever remains, no matter how unlikely it may seem, must be the truth"". Words to live by if I ever heard them. Today they say, ""It Is What It Is"".This a great collection for any fan of the Master Detective, Mr. Holmes, or for any lover of classic mystey writing. I highly recommend this, above all other publications of these classic works of the great Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. One of the greatest mystery writers of all times."

Through the eyes of the American ambassador to Berlin and his adult daughter, Mr. Larson shows in stunning fashion how the world was determined to ignore the warning signs, and thus the true intent of Hitler and the Nazi regime in Germany, until it was too late.

I was amazed by how indifferent America was as Mr. Dodd tried so hard to open their eyes to Hitler's real intent to start war.

The story is told in a realistic and very readable form. I had a little trouble getting started with it due to recent cataract surgery, but once I picked it back up, I almost couldn't put it down to go to sleep, or go to work or anything.  I read the last 330 pages of it in two evenings straight.

Socrates asks a lot of simple but very penetrating questions.  a common and fatal error in contemporary Platonic scholarship (but even in the past) is the answering of each question (quickly) singly and missing the big picture.  regardless of the historical existence of the philosophical Socrates or the historical occurence of the dialogues in the Republic, the account Plato has recorded for us in his book is among the most exact analyses of the human condition ever committed to paper.    the vocabulary is not difficult, but some of the concepts will require close attention.  it's better to read this book when you have some time to commit."

When Katharina agrees with Petruchio that the sun is a candle rush, she is not so much acquiescing as she is learning to be playful.  She is becoming civilized and using her ample wit and passion in a more focused way.  Her family had always given in to her bad temper and tantrums, but had not shown her love.  Petruchio really loved and wanted her, and not just for her money.  Initially he said that he was out for a rich bride, but after seeing her, he wanted her! She loved and wanted him, as evidenced by the fact that she cried when he was late to their wedding, not of broken pride, but of a broken heart.  When he asked her to kiss him in the street, she did so, as an act of rebellion WITH him!  In the end, her speech was very tongue in cheek, and she and Petruchio were playing the others.  Chastising those who had chastised her so often gave her great pleasure.  She was the most intelligent and respectful wife after all - because she was respected!  The other wives were not as good as Kate, and certainly not as interesting!  Petruchio had gotten the best woman, an equal in his eyes, and they had the utmost love and respect for each other.

-Plot &amp; Characters

This book has surpassed my expectations. Everything falls apart so quickly &ndash; it had me shaking and hardly breathing. Each individual plot is so expertly crafted that it demands attention. The logic is clean and motives behind the characters&rsquo; actions are believable.

Cinder: the levelheaded cyborg is struggling with her identity as a Lunar and trying to master her gift in time to stop the wedding. But with the guilt of an attempted rescue gone wrong, she is catapulted into an unforeseen path that leads her to a startling realization &ndash; is she becoming a monster... like Levana? As the plot thickens, the tension is rising to new levels to prepare for the final book.

Scarlet: this perspective was few and far between. Though I love Scarlet, some moments seemed to drag but this did not take away from the overall. One of my favorite chapters takes place in this plotline. After losing her grandma, Scarlet tries to move on and maybe get somewhere with Wolf. But when everything crumbles, she has to test her bravery and determination in the faces of some scary Lunars. Scarlet&rsquo;s strength is pushed to the limits in this exciting character development.

Cress: our title character is a very savvy hacker, having spent half her life in a satellite. Being there has left her naive and she knows that she is not strong like Thorne. Her story shows a side of the Union that I haven&rsquo;t seen before. Her whole plot is creative, cleverly tying in the Rapunzel references while still having a sense of a new story. It adds a needed layer book. And as the stakes are raised, Cress begins to see that she is strong: in her mind, heart, and in her willingness to help. Cress&rsquo;s optimistic, imaginative character brings a balance to the other girls and the story.

Kai: the Emperor of the Commonwealth is stressed, so much that he has been losing weight. He is being forced to marry Levana to protect Earth and he finds himself thinking about his inevitably short life at her side. The only consolation is that the girl he is still thinking about keeps managing to evade capture. Kai is the leader of the important plot point that drives half the characters.

Thorne: the charming and charismatic spaceship captain is back and I must say, I admire his courage and ability to put on a brave face in such adverse situations. And though he did lose my trust briefly, he regained in as soon as he gave me his reason. Existing as a juxtaposition of needing-help and help-giving, Thorne goes from more than comic-relief. He may not think he&rsquo;s a hero, but I do.

Wolf: I can&rsquo;t help but picture a kicked puppy. Wolf is upset by the dreadful turn of events and the way he reacts&hellip; He's sweet, but I really think that he could have held it together more. He didn&rsquo;t aid the plot much.

-Ending 
What happened before the cliffhanger is what is keeping it from bothering me as much as it should, I think. I was literally hyperventilating in school. But my goodness, the squealing and the dizziness and the general freak-out was worth it!

-Overall -- Absolutely wonderful!
Romances: so stinkin&rsquo; awesome!
Love Triangle: none (thank goodness!)
Characters: very fun and all unique
Plot: stable, logical, and enthralling
Freak-Out: major 
Cliffhanger: not terrible... but I still need Winter, preferably now
Mature Content: none

Happy reading!"
774,"Cress (The Lunar Chronicles, #3)",0312642970,Marissa Meyer,Barnes and Noble,4.6,WishEnd,"5+ Stars

I love fairy tales. I also love SciFi. Marissa Meyer does such an excellent job in putting these two together! It is amazing to me as well that in this third book of her Lunar Chronicles series that she also handles multiple points of view and story-lines so seamlessly without losing my interest or confusing me. This is storytelling at its best!

I don't know how she comes up with the back-stories for her characters that build these amazing plots, nor how she creatively takes a beloved fairy tale (Rapunzel) and creates this amazing story. I just know that she does it well. I was immediately drawn in to Cress's world, her joys, and her fears from the first page. None of the characters in this series are perfect, and Cress is no different. I would say, however, that all the characters are perfectly flawed and I wouldn't change a thing about them. They are all consistent and I felt they react as they should if they weren't just in a storybook world. I loved Cress! She is amazing! She isn't my favorite character. I think Cinder, Scarlet, and Thorne are all vying for that place, but I still love all of these characters. I can't say that I love the villains, which are Queen Lavana and Sybil, but they are very true to who they are and what they do.

I just have to note here that I am very happy with Thorne's place in the whole plot. I felt he was meant specifically for someone and now I know that he is and I am very happy about it. :) Prince Kai redeems himself to me in this book. I loved him in Cinder, not so much in Scarlet, and I am falling back in love with him in Cress. We also meet another leading man and a new leading lady that I'm sure will be much more present in the fourth book. I'm really looking forward to it!

The plot kept me turning the pages. Meyer doesn't let her characters off easy. She is actually pretty hard on all of them. They have a serious fight they have undertaken with serious decisions to be made that have major consequences. I'm glad that it hasn't been too easy, even though it was pretty difficult in spots. I was a little worried about what would happen and I'm glad that I'm happy with the way things are going. I'm really not sure what is going to unfold in the final book. I can figure out what needs to happen and probably what will happen, but I also know that it is going to be a tough journey for Cinder and her companions.

If you enjoy reading fairy tales (or very creative twists on them), or SciFi, then I would highly recommend reading Cress! The series just seems to get better and better. If there was a higher rating than 5, this book would get that for me.

I could not put this down as I was sucked in to this exhilirating story. Marissa Meyer has a true talent for telling stories and I am happy to have found this series.

775,Just Kids,006621131X,Patti Smith,Barnes and Noble,4.1,booksgalore62,"Ever since I was a teenager in the '70s, I have found Patti Smith to be an intriguing woman.  There was no one like her then and there is still no one like her.  The new book ""Just Kids"" details her earlier years in New York City, where she meets Robert Mapplethorpe and they begin their journey together trying to make it as artists.  Unlike most autobiographical books written by rock stars or other celebrities, this is extremely well written and not a self-indulgent publicity ploy.  It is an interesting look into friendship and loyalty as circumstances and relationships change. Even as their romance subsides, Patti and Robert still remain lifelong friends until his passing. While Robert was a much more controversial figure than Patti, I think this book sheds a lot of insight into both of their personalities.  Definitely a great read for anyone who is Patti Smith fan.  One of the best of its kind that I have read in a good while.  Glad I snapped it up quickly and I do hope she picks up where she left off here."
775,Just Kids,006621131X,Patti Smith,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Lobelia_Peppergrass,"One almost needs to have an art education to fully comprehend this story. Patti Smith's erudite tale is chock full of literary, poetic and artistic references. But, no matter. I like a challenge, and I will pursue each and every reference, from Baudelaire to Beau Geste to Bertolt Brecht to Corso and Mayakovsky. It's good exercise for the mind and soul.

Brave young Patti Smith escapes the prospects of a life of factory work in New Jersey; packing a few small belongings and even fewer coins and going to New York City to make her way into the art world. She meets the handsome artist Robert Mapplethorpe, and together they devote themselves to each other and to art. Their life in the Chelsea Hotel is fascinating, as are the many denizens of the hotel. This is a love story, and a story of perseverance.

If Just Kids was one of Robert Mapplethorpe's necklaces, Mapplethorpe himself would be the shining jewel, surrounded by a throng of lesser gems, like Sam Shepard, Janis Joplin, Harry Smith, Todd Rundgren, and even Smith herself. Mapplethorpe's genius, and also his dark side are described in detail. Her devotion to him never waivered, despite Mapplethorpe's ongoing homosexual experimentation and drug use.

The story ends with the death of Robert Mapplethorpe. I would have liked to have known more about Fred ""Sonic"" Smith, Bob Dylan, etc. and the music biz. Perhaps Ms. Smith will write of these later years in another book. I recommend this book to Patti Smith fans, and to anyone interested in the New York scene in the late sixties into the eighties.

This is probably the third book I've read that deals with weight problems.  It's definitely an engaging story, but I'm not sure I enjoy reading all aspects of it.  First, I was bothered by how skinny Jemima got and hoped that she didn't end the book this way, which would prove how much ""better"" it was to be skinny.  Second, I wasn't sure Ben, the main male character, was any better than the California hunk Jemima met; the book made Ben out to be a ""better"" man, more likable, but I felt otherwise.  It took her weight loss to make him see her differently, and though you see him think of her throughout the book, this sudden revelation of his feelings turning doesn't ultimately happen until he sees her skinny.  The situation with the Californian was very ironic, made me pity him and sad to think how much our environment regards ""fat"" people and affects our choices in life.  On the other hand, I do enjoy stories about finally ending up with the man of your dreams and finding oneself, to be comfortable with who you are, and have a good balance with everything in your life."

778,The Hunchback of Notre-Dame,0451527887,"Victor Hugo, Walter J. Cobb",Barnes and Noble,4,MissBoyer3 on LibraryThing,"Contrary to popular opinion the novel Le Notre Dame de Paris by Victor Hugo is not primarily about the deformed bell-ringer Quasimodo. Quasimodo's role is actually surprisingly small in the story, which makes you wonder why the English translater's chose ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" as the translation for the title. Actually, as the original French title would indicate, it is the cathedral itself that is the focus of the book. This is why in the unabridged editions of this book you will find numerous chapters that seemingly have nothing to do with the plot of the story. This is the books weakest point, and it may turn many people away from the book. Once you get into the plot, however, it is iimpossible to put the book down. The characters are intriguing: composer Pierre Gringoire, archdeacon Dom Claude Frollo, once a paragon of virtue now tormented by his corrupt love for a gipsy girl, L'Esmerelda, the naive gipsy dancer, Phoebus, the selfish, egotistical captain of the guards, and of course Qausimodo, a deaf, deformed bellringer. The relationships between these characters are complex and dark but they make an unforgettable story. The story is never, from front to back, a happy one, so if you are looking for a book that makes you ""feel good"" this is not the one for you. If, on the other hand, you are looking for a good book to read, that is unafraid to deal with the darker side of reality, I highly recommend ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame."""
779,A Fine Balance,140003065X,Rohinton Mistry,Barnes and Noble,4.3,ga4444,"This was a fascinating story, but the copy on my Nook was very hard to read since apparently a machine (not a person) converted it from print to electronic often resulting in nonsense words. Worst example: any word with an apostrophe (especially I'm) is converted to something indecipherable. This often completely breaks the flow of reading in trying to decide if the word is in Indian dialect or a misprint. I've seen this sort of thing in other books, but this one is the worst. I would recommend against bothering with the electronic form."
779,A Fine Balance,140003065X,Rohinton Mistry,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,This book is given only 3 stars because the Nook version needs to be better edited for typos.  There are MANY typos---you can still understand the novel but it becomes annoying very fast.

781,"Specials (Uglies, #3)",0689865406,Scott Westerfeld,Barnes and Noble,4.4,SheaFritz,"I can honestly say, this is Scott Westerfeld's finest. It was published by Simon & Schuster publishing division, and made the New York Times best seller list. You could say it was one of his best books yet. Enough suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat and enough humor to keep you interested. The 'Uglies' series is my favorite series, and this is my all time favorite book in the series.  

Tally still doesn't believe it's true. But according to the doctors, Dr. Cable, and the Crims, Tally has become special. Not just special, a Cutter. The coolest clique around. She had an operation, to make her frighteningly beautiful, dangerously strong, and breathtakeningly fast. A newly programmed robot, but a robot with a past. Looking at herself in the mirror, Tally doesn't recognize the person standing across from her. It wasn't about fitting in or her new appearance, it wasn't that her bones were light as bamboo and tough as diamonds, or even that the smokies were taking over the town. She was missing something. She was missing Zane.

Tally was in a new clique. Crims was way old news. Tally was now a cutter, cutting herself gave her an 'icy' feeling that kept her excited, happy, and entertained. The gashes and scars on her arms and hands only made her that much scarier. But Tally and her old friend Shay have gotten some bad news; news that could destroy the world completely. She has to fight for love, strength, and friendship. But with Zane in the hospital from brain damage, Tally trying to focus only becomes harder when all she can think about is Zane getting better. She begins to think herself out of 'special-mind'. She starts thinking as she did as an ugly. That just makes her life a whole lot more complicated.

There has not been a war in the world for at least 300 years. The pretty minds were supposed to keep people stupid so they would not take risks. But when a cure comes-a pretty cure--that makes the pretties think and the Uglies understand, not only your looks change during the operation, your mind changes. Tally then has to choose whether her special-ness makes the world a better place, or if everything she worked for has just been a huge mistake.

You must read this book, it's the best thing that happened to the 'Uglies' series. Reading this book is not only entertaining and exciting, it could actually happen. Showing how much everyone depends on technology and the adventures of a girl who just decided looks weren't everything, makes this book unforgettable. Reading this will give you a whole new look on the world, and it will become your favorite book in the first chapter."
781,"Specials (Uglies, #3)",0689865406,Scott Westerfeld,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"This book, best out of the tree in my opinion, is one of the best books I have ever read before. It is thrilling and emotional and excellent and very hard to put down. In some parts it gets very frustrating and very sad, but the book is still amazing nonetheless. Everyone must read this book, and the whole series, of course!!"
781,"Specials (Uglies, #3)",0689865406,Scott Westerfeld,Barnes and Noble,4.4,fluffymarshmellow,"This book was a major disappointment to someone who, like me, loved Uglies and Pretties.

The whole time I was reading Specials I felt like I was being set up for something that never came."
782,The Awakening,0543898083,Kate Chopin,Barnes and Noble,3.8,LVB4H8T,"A fascinating glimpse into a world that is past -- a world that was on the brink of change. Even if this were not a gripping story in its own right (which, by all means, it is), ""The Awakening"" would be worth reading simply for this social-historical vision.
This edition of The Awakening is a beautifully compiled work. I found it incredibly insightful as I used it for research papers in high school and college. The essays and criticism from Chopin's era are priceless. It was so helpful to have those along with the text, they really gave insight one could not find elsewhere. The Awakening continues to be my favorite book, this my favorite edition. If you are going to write a paper on this book or Chopin there is no other book that will help you more. This was a shocking novel in 1899 but today Pontellier's turmoil and dilemma would be neither unusual nor frightening and perhaps that is why modern man and woman usually succeed in handling these situations in a far better way than Pontellier."
782,The Awakening,0543898083,Kate Chopin,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Guest,"The book is about a woman trying to find herself   while bound by  the constraints of society.   Throughout the book she falls asleep and   reawakens to realize something new about   herself. I believe that the story of the book is very   strong, but where it lacks is in the writing itself. I   found the writing to be drawn out, and too wordy.   Chopin was a turn of the century writer, and many   of these writers used such a style. I believe   Chopins other works such as her short story   Deseree's Baby, were a little more exciting and   were a bit easier to read because they were in   short story form. The story of The Awakening   could make a very good short story, but the novel   form drags the story too much."
782,The Awakening,0543898083,Kate Chopin,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Anonymous,"It was difficult for me to like, sympathize or empathize with any of the main characters in this book.  Nevertheless, this is an interesting character profile of a member of the ""me generation"" born 100 years too early, set deep within creole New Orleans society.  An intellectually satisfying read."

This series reminded me of Twilight only because they both involved vampires, The House of Night series was more mature, had more developed characters, harder more elaborate plots and did a good job with it's invented religion.  I received this series on Christmas Day, four days ago and already I have completed it along with another vampire series.  I tried to slow down as I read them in order to savor them but found I could hardly put any of the books down for more than a couple minutes.  If you like fantasy and fiction then this series is definitively for you.  If you read Twilight or Blue Bloods and wanted more romance and emotion then this series will have you reeling and thirstily awaiting the next book."

Cast, Kristin Cast",Barnes and Noble,4.5,AngelsTouch,"I know this book is written with a realistic sense that there is more than one boy in her life rather than finding your one true love like most other books.  It seems Zoey's lack of father figure in her life has left her a little emotionally disabled once it comes to men.  I mean she gets back together with Erik and what, 4 hrs later she's telling Heath she loves him still???  I won't say anymore details but seriously this whole boy drama needs to be toned down.  It almost seems that the boy drama is filling in the story to make the books longer.  I loved this series when I first started reading it but enough is enough!  It's to the point where I don't like Zoey anymore and even her friends find her a little ridiculous.  I really want to fall back in love with this series again so I'm praying the next book is a little more mature than the last.  Otherwise I liked the book.  It did leave a lot of things unanswered but it keeps you guessing and wondering what the red fledglings are really like.  You get a little teaser on their true nature that keeps you sitting on the edge waiting for something bad to happen.  I can't wait till the next book comes out but if it's the same as Hunted then I'm retiring the series to my shelf."

It forces us to question our mortality and of our loved ones. This is the story of Chick Benetto, a former professional baseball player. After middle age attacks Chick, he decides to take his own life after having lost both of his parents, his job and his marriage. Since his mother's death 8 years earlier, he'd been slowly drinking himself to death. Chick decides to visit his parent's boarded up home one last time before he puts the gun to his head. When he lets himself into the house he finds food cooking and a well-stocked house. He turns a corner. There stands is mother welcoming him with open arms. Chick has one last day with his mother, day to watch her work, to talk with her and sees his past the way it really was and not as he'd imagined it.

Has there ever been a person who did not wish For One More Day with a deceased loved one? This little book is a bit of wish fulfillment that is filled with hope and love. Charley Benetto is fortunate enough to get one more day with his deceased mother, as he lay dying in the grass after a botched suicide attempt. His mother teaches him lessons that help him to turn his broken life around, allowing him to reconcile with his daughter and begin leading a productive life. Ultimately I think this book hooked because I am a mother, and it made me think about the legacy that I want to leave in my childrens' eyes. It also made me think about my own childhood and my relationship with my parents. It doesn't take very long to read this book, but the warm fuzzies linger on for significantly longer. This is a wonderfully-intriguing story that is cleverly fashioned and highly recommended."

785,"Clear and Present Danger (Jack Ryan Universe, #6)",0425144372,Tom Clancy,Barnes and Noble,4.5,IamBrandon,"In Tom Clancy&rsquo;s novel, &ldquo;Clear and Present Danger,&rdquo; a clever and effective series of connected events all play out simultaneously which ultimately lead to a final and spectacular story. The novel begins by introducing several characters. The first is the secret service admiral whose name is Cutter, also known as &ldquo;Lumberjack.&rdquo; Next, it introduces Ramon and Jesus, two foreign men who are at work on the yacht called Empire Builder. Then Sergeant Chavez and his team are introduced as being on a covert mission and riding in a Black Hawk helicopter. 
As the story progresses, you are introduced to many more characters. There is Red Wagner, &ldquo;The king of search and rescue,&rdquo; who is the captain of the ship known as Panache. You learn about the life and military history of Staff Sergeant Domingo Chavez, &ldquo;Ding.&rdquo; Lieutenant Jackson is Chavez&rsquo;s commander and has a brother who works at the Pentagon. Mr. Clark is introduced; he is the CIA&rsquo;s Operations Directorate and a very mysterious man. Clark is not even his real name. You will later meet Ernesto Escobedo, the leader of the Columbian drug cartel, and Felix Cortez, an intellectual and highly trained (KGB) Marxist who works for him. More characters include Daniel Murray, Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI; Jack Ryan, the Deputy Director (Investigation)&rsquo;s special assistant; Moira Wolfe, Executive Secretary of the FBI, who works for Emil Jacobs, the Director of the FBI.It all starts with Ramon and Jesus, who work for the Columbian drug cartel. They have been discovered on the Empire Builder by Captain Wagner. There is hard evidence that points toward brutal and ruthless crime, including rape, murder, and drug smuggling. The crew of Wagner&rsquo;s ship harasses and scares the men. Around this time, United States law enforcement has been harassing the cartel immensely. As a result, the cartel assassinates three important US political officials to send a message. The president, who was friends with one of the men who was assassinated, regards their message as an act of war.
	From that point on, Chavez and his team along with several other branches of the military began to attack the cartel. The attacks result in a large amount of casualties and include a volume of collateral damage. The delightful complexity and authentic devotion to detail is what creates the story&rsquo;s captivation and realistic feeling. Tom Clancy uses several elements of realism in the novel. The characters are depicted realistically, and the larger than life hero is therefore avoided. The details are very unemotional and firm as well. 
	When and after reading &ldquo;Clear and Present Danger,&rdquo; you might contemplate your own political or ethical views. It will have you asking questions that you may not have thought of before. How far must criminal activity go before it is considered a threat to national security? How far can you go with an enemy before it is too far? When is it right for one side to accept that they&rsquo;ve had enough? You may ask all of these or more. All in all, I regard the book to be a pronounced illustration of detailed and suspenseful modern warfare that should be enjoyed by anyone with a taste in outsized; gripping plots that are shaped by layers of weaved contingencies."

786,Falling Up,0060513098,Shel Silverstein,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"Falling up is a terrific book by Shel Silverstein.  I liked falling up because of the pictures. Shel does not put a lot of work into his pictures. I like the pictures because they go along with the poems and the pictures are funny. Shel makes up a lot of cool characters and words. Some times his poems are hard to under stand. But they are still funny.
I can connect to the poem ""The Runners"" because my parents coach track so I like every thing about track. The poem ""The Runners"" is a funny poem because the coach is a lion. The players say they have a great practice field but they don't because they run on dirt, jump over ditches with spears popping out and have a lion coming behind them.
I do not like the poem ""Long Scarf"" because the boy slipped and tripped and his head got cut off. That just grosses me out. Then he put it back on. To keep his head on he wrapped the scarf around his neck. Then he took it off and his head came off with the scarf. EWWWW.
I like the poem ""Yuck"". I liked this poem because the yuck is like tar. Ont time I got tar on the bottom of my shoe it took FOREVER to get off. I tried to get it off with a stick but the stick got stuck on the bottom of my shoe.so I had to throw them away. This poem is so funny."

787,Sh*t My Dad Says,0061992704,Justin Halpern,Barnes and Noble,4.2,TroyP,"I just bought this book and am only about 4 chapters into it and already I have laughed so hard my sides hurt.  I have read some sections to my wife and she too has laughed a lot.  This book isn't for anyone who does not like bad language but if you don't mind it this book will crack you up.  My mother was a lot like the writers dad.  What ever hit her brain often came out her mouth spiced with curse words.  I loved my mom for her honesty and that you always knew where you stood with her.  This guys dad is like that and I think I would love hanging around this out spoken and hard working man. It would remind me of home.

The writing is done in a very friendly way. That is to say you can almost hear the writer's voice in your  head telling you these stories and picture him rolling his eyes and blushing at the antics of his outspoken dad.

It is a very fun read that is just for laughs.  But if you read closely you can also tell that this outspoken man loves and supports his family 100% and no one is more on their sides than he is.  Reminds me of my folks again.  But if you don't want to get too  deep into the meaning of the stories but just need a laugh then this book is great too.

I can see myself rereading this book for a good laugh when I feel like I need one and telling friends about sections of it.

By the way this is my first book review ever. I love books and reading and figure I often like reading what others have to say about a book and thought I would finally put my two cents worth in on something I liked."

788,Trainspotting,2020336464,"Irvine Welsh, Eric Lindor Fall",Barnes and Noble,4.6,Guest,"The only book to compare this one to is 'A Clockwork Orange.'  Even Burgess' masterful novel can't compare to this strange, horrifying, visceral, funny, and entertaining knock out.  The characters are lowlifes and, at the same time, sympathetic.  The stories, at first glance, don't look like they flow together, but when Welsh drags you deeper into his depressing, bleak, gallows humour infested world, you feel its correllation.  It seems as if Irvine is a fly on the wall, able to analyze (and sometimes divulge) into the darkness of living.  At times, this book has the same feel of Celine's 'Journey to the End of the Night' with its raging, maniacal prose, in sections, anyways.  Other times it felt like a gothic novel set amidst an industrial wasteland full of sociopaths, heroin addicts, and all around scum bags. Think Wuthering Heights if it were written by Hubert Selby Jr, set in modern day Edinburgh.  Violence is always up in the air, ready to explode at any minute.  It's impossible to set this three hundred page wallop down, despite the fact that you really want to - the uncomfortable truths this aesthetically driven masterpiece exposes is unbelievably disgusting to dissect, but the author pulls you in and doesn't let go.  This assemblage is a nightmare, content wise  there are so many sequences that make you cringe, and if you don't cringe, you're just a sick person, period.  Sure, many people have pointed out how funny the novel is.  Granted, while it is laugh out loud hilarious, it's still terrifying.  This is an admirable feat. Welsh has managed to dig so incredibly deep into the foggy netherworld of the Scottish proleteriat, tearing down a verdigris moss covered wall to discover the restlessly vicious honesty on the other side and, at the same time, still gaze at it through a comedian's lens.  This makes aspiring authors (such as me) hate him with an envy. Each story he manages to end with a sting.  He zaps the reader with rhythem.  The famed phonetic scottish dialect is admirable.  Welsh knows how difficult it is to read, and through the consistent challenge of understanding this prose, the writer makes sure he pummels you with discomforting altruisms on nearly every page.  In a transgressional novel written in plain english, it's easy to skip whatever line you want.  If you don't want to read something, you don't have to.  With this book, you have to.  The honesty is what impressed me most about 'Trainspotting.' Having read thousands of novels, I've never ran across a text that was so originally inventive with getting across incompassionate personalities.  The (second) funeral scene for Tommy was my favorite.  There's an interior monologue for each character attending, and it's simply astounding  it reminds you of how low the human race can go in terms of being unsympathetic and inhumane.  While many would argue that Welsh is by no means a moralist (and I'm not inclined to intensely disagree with this supposition) I think that there is a speck of allegory dotting this map of anarchic nihilism.  It only exists tonally, however.  It's not spoonfed to you in the last couple of pages, a technique that famed author Palahniuk executes in most of his novels.  Upon finishing Trainspotting, I felt like three years had been taken off of my life.  It was a draining, satisfying experience.  You can't really describe the reading of this novel to anyone who hasn't done it  the entire thing is a rollar coaster ride."

I am also a Christian, while at the same time being open-minded and willing to hear other people's points of view.  The basic 'agreements' do not infringe on my beliefs.  Those that are offended should try not to 'take it personally' (one of the 4 agreements).  If all religions could apply these principles we would be much better off."
790,The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom,1878424505,Miguel Ruiz,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"I'm in recovery for Bulimia and my therapist actually recommended this book and I'm so glad she did! I thought it was amazing and everything seemed to hit so close to home. It all seems so simple but he elaborates on all the agreements and really makes you want to follow them.

One person wrote that he says if someone else is angry w/ you or whatever it's their problem, etc. And the reviewer said maybe sometimes it is your fault. I interpreted it differently. He definitely makes it clear that you are in control and if you judge someone or are angry w/ someone, it has to do with you and your beliefs. So he was saying if someone is angry with you it has to do w/ their beliefs, so it works both way. 

I like how he really makes you feel like you are in control. Other reviewers have said it's self centered, but the only thing you can truly control is indeed yourself! So if you life isn't going right, etc then it's most likely you and not any of the things you're blaming."
790,The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom,1878424505,Miguel Ruiz,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"Many people seem to like this book, but I am not quite sure why.  This book is full of very common platitudes and dangerously self-centered ideas.  The main premise of this book seems to be that each person should treat themselves like the center of the universe.  He states that if someone criticizes you or is angry with you, it is because of their own issues, and not you, and therefore you have no responsibility to address it (he terms their feelings and words 'black magic' and 'poison').  Well, sometimes you ARE the problem, and pretending that you are not will not lead you to any sort of 'heaven on earth,' especially for the people around you.  He also contradicts himself (i.e., we are all God but there is also a Creator who is separate - how does that work?), misquotes the Bible to support his statements, and has a tough time staying on topic.   Do not waste your time reading this - find something substantial that will move you to exhibit real love to those around you and to yourself."
791,House Rules,0743296435,Jodi Picoult,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Nancy-Dash,"Jodi Picoult's latest novel is a sensitive and moving insight into the lives of one family affected by Asperger's Syndrome. Jacob is an eighteen year old young man struggling to appear ""normal"" in a world that is NOT yet prepared to welcome him as he is. While unwittingly involving himself in a serious crime, Picoult manages to share with the reader the deepest feelings of his mother Emma, his younger brother Theo, and Jacob himself as he is forced to do the one thing that children with Asperger's find most impossible to do...to make contact with world; and in Jacob's case have his voice heard in our judicial system. Through Jacob we learn what it is truly like to live daily with the painful social isolation, eccentric behavior,and circumscribed passions of someone who struggles to just ""fit in"" and connect to others. From the moment you enter Jacob, Emma and Theo's life, Picoult skillfully teaches us about the pain and pleasure of having an Asperer's child in the family in vivid detail and with powerful imagery. Ironically,with this well written and absorbing novel, Picoult achieves the very contact with the reader that you will wish Jacob and others who struggle with this variant of Autism could do on their own."
791,House Rules,0743296435,Jodi Picoult,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"Jodi Picoult's latest book is redundant of her previous works, with the substitution of Jacob, a young man with Asperger's syndrome, for the character in previous disease (or social ill)-of-the-week plots. It's obvious Picoult's done a lot of research, and she appears to ""nail"" the character of Jacob. It's worth reading the chapters in his voice to learn about the thought process and behavior of a person with Asperger's. The other characters, however, are hardly more than cardboard cutouts. The mother is especially disappointing. How did this woman of strong educational background, great heart, and earnest endeavor, who has worked tirelessly and successfully to champion her son in the bureaucracy of education, do so without finding allies along the way to aid her when facing the challenge of a new bureaucracy in the court system? And how is it that the skills learned in a school setting were so difficult to transfer to the bureaucracy of a court setting? That just didn't ring true. Also, parents who work so hard through the system on behalf of their special-needs children are generally not taken by surprise when the child turns 18 and is considered an adult by the outside world; they work ahead of time to prepare for that eventuality, especially in this day and age when medical personnel can't even discuss care matters of an 18+-y.o. child without a signed release.

My advice: ignore the substandard plot and flat characters of most chapters, and just go for the gold: Jacob's voice. There's much to be learned there from a character worth getting to know."
791,House Rules,0743296435,Jodi Picoult,Barnes and Noble,4.1,harstan,"Emma Hunt has dedicated her life to her son Jacob who suffers with Asperger's syndrome.  Her sacrifice has come with personal lost and cost as her career was pushed aside; her ex-husband Henry the computer programmer left as he worked at home and could not concentrate with the tantrums; and her other son Theo three years younger than Jacob is expected to watch over him when mom cannot, but ignored otherwise by her as he cannot even get his permit.  She lives to protect Jacob and Theo understands that the prime house rule is take care of your brother.

However, her efforts to give her soon a life fall apart when the police charge eighteen years old Jacob with the murder of Jess Ogilvy.  His inability to understand non verbal signs and comprehend social nuances puts Jacob at risk.  Desperate, she hires Oliver O. Bond as Jacob's lawyer.

This is a super look at Asperger's Syndrome, but not just the person suffering from it, but also the impact on family members especially Theo.   The murder mystery tales a back seat even in the courtroom to how Henry thinks and reacts to senses overload, which can be simply crinkling of paper.  Rotating perspective between family members, the lawyer and others, fans obtain a deep look at the total impact of Asperger's Syndrome.

Stories of comeuppance and knowing ones¿ place in society are in many of the tales, but so are stories of ¿happily ever after.¿ For me, it¿s the sheer volume of stories that is intriguing. It¿s easy to pick a favorite story for however one might be feeling at the time and get a lift or feeling of vengeful satisfaction in the misfortunes of the bad characters that remind us of terrible bosses or the guy who cut us off in traffic."

793,From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler,0744583276,E.L. Konigsburg,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"I love the book From the Mixed up Files of Mrs. Basil E Frankweiler by E.L. Konigsburg. It¿s about Claudia and Jamie, the main characters who run away from home because they think they are having too many injustices. They run away to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. They run away with only $24 to live on. They sleep in dusty old beds and hide in the restrooms for many hours a day. They always have excuses why they were caught by the guard. But one time while Jamie was hiding in the men¿s room and he heard the water running. He thought that it was just another visitor but it was a janitor who was wondering why Jamie was there. Jamie, the second youngest can take on any challenge like hiding his things in historical figures. Claudia the oldest of four kids is very intelligent. She is the one who comes up with the plans for everyday, like how many hours to hide in the bathrooms and how many hours they get to sleep so they won¿t get caught by the night guard and how much they should spend on the two meals they get a day. I love this book because it is an exciting adventure about Claudia and Jamie. I haven¿t finished the book yet but I can¿t wait to read the adventure that awaits. It also makes me want to really go and visit the Metropolitan Museum of art in New York. And like I said I highly suggest it."

Konigsburg, is a great book because it is funny and gives good detail about the adventures of Claudia and James Kincaid. Claudia loves secrets and Jamie loves challenges. Claudia felt injustice at her home, so she decided to run away. She chose her brother, ""Jamie"", to run away with her because he had a lot of money. They decided to stay at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. They learned something everyday. When they saw a sculpture called Angel, they were so interested in it because its sculptor was unknown. The two children actually found a clue to whom really made Angel. They sent an anonymous letter to the museum owners to tell them about the clue, but, sadly, the Metropolitan Museum of Art already knew. Claudia and Jamie were so interested in the clue that they actually went to the house of the person who auctioned Angel to the museum. They found out everything at the house: (1) if the work was designed by Michelangelo, (2) if the work was designed, but not done by Michelangelo, or (3) if Michelangelo did not have anything to do with the sculpture at all. In the end, Claudia and Jamie came back home with a story to tell and secrets NOT to be told."

I do not think I have enjoyed a book like I did this one in quite sometime. Thank you, Samantha Young. I hope you keep them coming. I surely will not miss any books from you in the future. 

The sex scenes were hot, but I love that they add to the story, but they are not the story. The two main characters are fantastic, multi-deminsional people. You almost felt like you know them. I can't say enough, but I surely do not want to ruin  the story for anyone. So Kudos on a fabulous read, Ms. Young."

I could not have been more wrong. The writing is exceptional, the characters are very well developed, and you are sucked into the story from the start. The male character, Braden, is a delight and you love him from beginning to end. His love for Joss is genuine, patient yet steamy and full of passion. One of the best male characters I have read for a long time. Joss is full of issues but does not get on you nerves. They make an unusual but great couple. Oh, and although I seldom laugh while reading, there were several dialogs that literally cracked me up. I finished it and read it again one more time, which I seldom do as well. Really terrific!"

797,Crazy Love: Overwhelmed by a Relentless God,1434768511,"Francis Chan, Danae Yankoski, Chris Tomlin",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Zbee,"I enjoyed the book because it highlighted much of what we go through as Christians who want more but remain in the passive state of routine. It was motivational because it asserts the fact that there is more of God to experience if we want to. Feeling guilty because of what he says is not what I perceive is his intention but rather he relates his own grief and guilt that took him from where he used to be to where he is and where he is going.His guilt was his relationship with his father, for each of us it's something else. It was sincerely refreshing to be encouraged to move forward when sometimes your own church doesn't foster that kind of deep search for a personal relationship. Unfortunately many churches are so concerned with what their members can give that sometimes the personal relationship between them and God is lacking. This book blocks you from pointing fingers. This about you and your relationship with God, and what you want it to be like, what it should be like. 

I enjoyed every moment of it."
797,Crazy Love: Overwhelmed by a Relentless God,1434768511,"Francis Chan, Danae Yankoski, Chris Tomlin",Barnes and Noble,4.3,billball,"Some neighbors told me about this book.  They seemed to have been thrown into consternation by reading it.  So I picked up a copy.

The author states his purpose on p. 21:  ""This book is written for those who want more Jesus.  I hope reading this book will convince you of something:  that by surrendering yourself totally to God's purposes, He will bring you the most pleasure in this life and the next.""

He then goes on to berate his readers.  He seems to assume that they are not of the group for whom he has said he had written.  P. 22:  ""The core problem isn't the fact that we're lukewarm,...  The crux of it all is why we are this way, and it's because we have an inaccurate view of God.""

The book follows this pattern as the author does a good cop, bad cop routine, lifting his readers' spirits, then bringing them crashing down.  I feel that there is frustration in his writing - a frustration that I have felt as a pastor and which my congregation probably also sensed in my preaching.  We all want to see our flocks walking closer to God, but instead see many living a passive Christianity.  I fear books such as this have little positive effect.

The first few chapters alternate between great statements about the majesty of God and the readers' passive understanding of Him.  The author challenges the readers to understand that ""The greatest good on this earth is God"" and to love Him.  All good stuff!

In ch. 4, ""Profile of the Lukewarm,"" the author does his bad cop routine.  He gives what he claims is ""a description of what halfhearted, distracted, partially committed, lukewarm people can look like"" and challenges his readers to see if they fit the description.  He cites passages seemingly selected at random, most of which are not even aimed at professing Christians and NONE of which use the word lukewarm.  Any of us could look through these passages and find some fault or faults of ours there.

In ch. 5 he says:  ""... a lukewarm Christian is an oxymoron; there's no such thing ... churchgoers who are lukewarm are not Christians.  We will not see them in heaven.""  He quotes Rev. 3:15-18, a portion of the letter from the risen Christ to the church at Laodicea, the ONLY passage where the word lukewarm is used in the Bible.  The addressees are, as the author argues, not saved people.  The logic is faulty.  In ch. 4, he defines lukewarm so as to include most of us.  Now we're told we are not going to heaven.

After frightening his readers, he then switches to his good cop routine.  He says, ""I do not want true believers to doubt their salvation as they read this book.""

The next few chapters continue the roller coaster ride:  doubt - assurance - doubt - assurance.

Apparently Pastor Chan is uncomfortable with his use of guilt and fear as a motivator.  He keeps introducing pologies:  ""Perhaps it sounds as though I believe you have to work your way to Jesus.  I don't.  I fully believe that we are saved by grace, through faith, ... My fear in writing the previous chapter is that it only evokes in you fear and guilt ... actions driven by fear and guilt are not an antidote to lukewarm, selfish, comfortable living.""

I believe Chan's desires are correct;  he wants his readers totally committed to Christ.  There is much truth to be gained from reading this book, but I would not recommend it.  The style is manipulative!

Yet this individual wasn¿t deterred in the slightest for her yearning to learn.      	Reading this book you will see parts of the story of Helen Keller that you¿ve never heard before because she is telling the story.  Helen Keller had a very difficult time when she was little.  She couldn¿t see or hear therefore she couldn¿t talk, which often made her very upset.  And so she would throw tantrums quite often when she could not get people to understand her.  But that was all over when Helen met her teacher 'Anne Sullivan' who was a ray of sunshine, a glimmer of hope in a black world of everlasting night.  Helen was determined at first, but then began to believe it was impossible to ever fit in with anybody else.  Her new teacher never gave up and from the moment Helen said her first word ¿water¿, she took off like a rocket.  She learned to talk, read and write, all the while learning little lessons on science, math, and history.  She was always grateful to her teacher, who gave her hope and joy, to be able to talk with her mouth instead of her hands.  But Helen¿s story did not stop there.  She went on to college, and learned to love canoeing and sailing.

801,This is Where I Leave You,052595127X,Jonathan Tropper,Barnes and Noble,4.1,hesitanthousewife,"Jonathan Tropper is known for his hilarious and clever novels, and he does not disappoint with his latest creation, This Is Where I Leave You.

Judd Foxman's life is a mess. He comes home early from work to find his beautiful wife, Jen, in bed with another man. And not just any man, but his boss. After moving out of his charming suburban home and into a shoddy basement apartment, he is informed of his father's death. Suprisingly, although he was never a religious man, his dad's dying wish was for his family to sit Shiva for one week, in his honor. Reluctantly, Judd heads to his mother's house.

Judd's family is a comedy lover's dream. Dysfunctional doesn't even begin to describe this clan. His mother is a world renowned parenting expert who can't even begin to understand her own children. His youngest brother, Philip, is a playboy who is constantly finding himself in one crisis or another. He comes to the family home with a guest that no one can quite figure out. Paul, his older brother, harbors a lot of resentment towards Judd. He and his wife are also struggling with fertility issues. His sister, Wendy, is his rock. But she is stuck is a loveless marriage and dealing with her own romantic disasters. Now all these siblings are forced to stay under the same roof. Add to this list a number of oddball mourners who come to pay their respects and you've got a week of dysfunctional comic drama. The repercussions are laugh out loud funny and poignant at the same time.

As I read this book, I couldn't help but think that it would make an amazing movie. The characters are just so oddly lovable and relatable. The family dynamic is incredibly familiar and easy to identify with. The Foxman's are everyone's family. Sure, they are somewhat eccentric and manipulative, but the love they have for each other is clear. Yes, they may despise each other at times, but underneath the chaos is an undying loyalty to each other. And isn't that pretty much how every family works?"

Tropper's writing is so realistic, half way through I had to remind myself I wasn't reading a biography, but a work of fiction. He crafts his characters very well, and you have no choice but to sympathize and empathize with these people. They are very real. The book tugs at your heart and gives you hope, and is not fantastical in any sort of way. It caused me to then continue reading books by Tropper, and I have yet to be disappointed.

804,The Tempest,0743482832,William Shakespeare,Barnes and Noble,4,RogerRamjet on LibraryThing,"On rereading the Tempest, I realize that despite the title there is very little action in the play and it demonstrates Shakespeare's emphasis on character over plot.  But the characters are fascinating.  Prospero at times seems a type for the author himself, and of course as such he is the wise master and hero.  But at the same time or a moment later, his manipulations and his selfishness make it not too hard to empathize with the hatred he inspires in Caliban, despite Caliban's repugnance.  Then in the Epilogue, Prospero, not just a character that walks off of the page, actually asks the audience for permission to walk off of the page before doing so.  There is not time to discuss all of the characters, but Miranda's sudden transformation from wondering innocence to worldly cynicism is both startling and yet somehow believable.  I remember the Tempest being described as Shakespeare's perfect play, because it so completely conforms to Aristotle's unities of time, place and action.  Yet the play has to be considered experimental in its deliberate artificiality and the distance between the audience and the action because it is a play within a play within a play.  It is in essence a play about the making of a play.  Definitely worth repeated readings."
804,The Tempest,0743482832,William Shakespeare,Barnes and Noble,4,aethercowboy on LibraryThing,"I picked up the Tempest, I admit, mostly due to Prospero's role in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. I was not disappointed.The Tempest tells the story of Prospero, the supplanted Duke of Milan, who takes control of small island. He's freed a spirit from a tree, who now faithfully follows him; and he's enslaved the twisted (physically and mentally) denizen of the island.Prospero discovers that his supplanting brother is nearby on a ship, so he calls a mighty tempest to beach them upon his island. He then tries to work the situation to his advantage, as well as marry off his daughter to the prince, who has likewise washed ashore.The Tempest is a comedy, which may give you some indication of how it ends, but it is not the destination with this play; rather, it is the route traveled.If you have ever read anything by Shakespeare, you're bound to enjoy The Tempest, even if you hated what you read, since you were most likely in high school, dissecting the lifeless dry corpse of literature. Like an airy spirit, breathe new life into your comprehension of literature, and get yourself a copy of the Tempest, and start reading!"

805,"Burned (House of Night, #7)",1905654944,"P.C. Cast, Kristin Cast",Barnes and Noble,4.4,StampDecor,"When I first began to read this series I did enjoy the story.  
It drove me crazy in the first few books that the author repeated so much from the previous books (things that REALLY didn't needed refreshing on. I mean if you can't remember who the characters are you should just probably REREAD the books) but it wasn't enough to stop me from getting the next book.  
I will say I am done reading the books because I feel I am wasting my time.  This book was the worst of the series.  These books could have easily been written in trilogy without so much fluff.

This never ending story needs an ending.  I will choose to just read it up on the internet."
805,"Burned (House of Night, #7)",1905654944,"P.C. Cast, Kristin Cast",Barnes and Noble,4.4,GradStudent_CR,"Burned was better than Tempted, which is a relief.  I was under the impression the this book would conclude the series.  This is not the case, my friends.  Who knows how many more books there will be...These authors are obviously milking this idea for everything they can, which is understandable.  I would too, I suppose.  I'll give my opinion to you straight:  Zoey isn't in this book.  This is about Stevie Rae, bottom line.  Her picture on the cover should be a dead giveaway.  I'm a big fan of Zoey, so I am disappointed.  I find Stevie Rae to be a stupid, silly little girl, and I'm 27 and find it hard to relate to that kind of character.  A younger audience is going to love this book, but an older audience will be disappointed.  Where is the depth?  Depth will not be attained if the authors choose to write another book about Stevie Rae.  Although, I will read the next book to find out what happens to Zoey, because I absolutely love her."
805,"Burned (House of Night, #7)",1905654944,"P.C. Cast, Kristin Cast",Barnes and Noble,4.4,lilmudduckmuffineater,"This is the seventh book in the House of Night series. I just absolutely love the cover and the fact they put Stevie Rae on the cover, that's almost exactly how I envisioned her to look like while reading this series. I liked this book but will admit it isn't my favorite in the series. It's a good book, don't get me wrong,it's action packed with the whole love thing I can't get enough of, but it just didn't have enough of Zoey for me. Zoey is my favorite character in the whole series, I do like the fact we got to see more inside Rehpaim's mind though, he is definately my second favorite character now. And it's awesome Stevie Rae is getting into the love thing lol more in this book. This book ties up a lot of things from the other books and now I'm super excited and can't wait to read the next book Awakened when it comes out. This series is like an obsession for me, I can't get enough. I'm now one of those fangirls I now despise lol! Not afraid to admit it! Zoey's soul has shattered after sending spirit to attack Kalona after he murdered Heath. Neferet has sent Kalona's spirit to the Otherworld to make sure Zoey never comes back. Meanwhile Stevie Rae is coming to terms with her imprint with Rephaim and the feelings they are starting to feel for each other. Stevie Rae is discovering that dark and light isn't always so clear, and decisions are sometimes hard to make. Aphrodite is coming to terms with being a prophetess of Nyx and discovering she could do more than she ever thought possible. Stark has found his bloodline and has found a way through it to try to save Zoey and become more than just her Warrior, he wants to be her Guardian, and realizes love can't fix everything."

Never have i been brought so close to fictional characters. The development of Roland in this portion of his tale is exceptional. This volume is the hook, if you werent hooked already."
806,"Wizard and Glass (The Dark Tower, #4)",0340829788,"Stephen King, Dave McKean",Barnes and Noble,4.5,James Snietka,Builds to a crescendo that leaves you begging for more.  The story of Roland's youth is fantastic and hard to put down.  Easily the best book so far!
806,"Wizard and Glass (The Dark Tower, #4)",0340829788,"Stephen King, Dave McKean",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"The first 2/3 of the book seems to be very slow moving, and were difficult to maintain interest in. However, the last third picks up the pace and keeps your attention well.

Fills in a lot of the back story missing in the first 3 installments."
807,The Circle,0385351399,Dave Eggers,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Anonymous,"With all the discussions on privacy today, this book makes you squirm. It would be easy to dismiss the complications presented in the disguise of the story line but you would be doing a disservice to the intent of the novel. Every self rightous person thinks they understand privacy but it is too easy to ignore the complications. Mr.Eggers does not let you glibbly profess to be serious about the meaning of privacy. He keeps throwing fast balls directly at your biases, hitting you often as you scream foul.  In fact, one should probably review Kant's discussions and definations of privacy pertaining to people and things. So if you read a review of this book which harps on shallowness of characters, remember the author knows what he is doing, it is a sophticated writing device. I give this book 5 stars because it makes you think , rethink, reposition, and review your view of privacy. A must read, but it is not a book you will walk away from saying you love it. rather you will admit we need it."
807,The Circle,0385351399,Dave Eggers,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Anonymous,"Think George Orwell too frumpy or old? Then read this current and hip look at one possible reality.  Excellent read that will challange you to carefully think about technology, the ethics around technology, and why- when we have so much evidence to the contrary - humans believe they can be God.  Excellent."
807,The Circle,0385351399,Dave Eggers,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Anonymous,"I love the concept of this book: technology is wonderful... up to a point. But the execution is ham-fisted at best. Everything is on the nose and predictable while at the same time, nothing is truly fleshed out enough to feel like a good story. We don't really get to know most of the characters and in many instances pivotal moments are skipped over only to be recounted in the past tense. Show don't tell, Mr. Eggers. I really expected more from this book. Again, very interesting concept, definitely thought-provoking. But ultimately disappointing as a novel."

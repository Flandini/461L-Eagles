101,Me Talk Pretty One Day,0349113912,David Sedaris,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"I laughed till I cried at his earlier books, but--I swear I'm not making this up--I laughed so hard I almost threw up when I was reading Me Talk Pretty One Day.  I was home alone and couldn't wait for my husband to come home so I could read parts of it to him."
101,Me Talk Pretty One Day,0349113912,David Sedaris,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,Sedaris lands a firm whack to the funny bone!  The next thing you know you're laughing out loud....and explaining yourself to people who've noticed.
101,Me Talk Pretty One Day,0349113912,David Sedaris,Barnes and Noble,4.1,CBGN,"I love listening to David Sedaris. His stories are always hilarious, often touching and frequently completely inappropriate for children."
102,Where the Wild Things Are,0099408392,Maurice Sendak,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,My brothers and I all loved this book as kids. It is one of the classic books you remember reading when you were little. A story that touches you more with age.
102,Where the Wild Things Are,0099408392,Maurice Sendak,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,What a wonderful reread.  The illustrations are vivid and imaginative. Agreat bedtime story.
102,Where the Wild Things Are,0099408392,Maurice Sendak,Barnes and Noble,4.5,LuckyShamrock,"Growing up this book was one of my favorites! Now that I have 2 daughters of my own, I had to buy it! So many thoughts come rushing through my mind when I read this to them. I feel like a child again and the lesson of behaving stays in my mind. Now that they have made a movie, I had to show my girls where it all started. I love the illustrations and the story line! I love this book and I recommend it to everyone with their inner child still left in them!"
103,The Count of Monte Cristo,0140449264,"Alexandre Dumas, Robin Buss",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"I have noticed that most of the reviews for this edition speak about Dumas' work in general, but I have to make a point that Robin Buss makes in the beginning of the book: almost every other version of The Count of Monte Cristo in English is either an abridgment or the product of Victorian editing.

This book has to be praised for the mere fact that Buss went back to the original French and translated it wonderfully, not abridging or altering the essential storyline. 

As of now, this is the only edition of such caliber that I know of, and for now, it is all I recommend that people buy.

Avoid all other editions and publishers, or at least make sure whether the one you want is an abridgment or not."
103,The Count of Monte Cristo,0140449264,"Alexandre Dumas, Robin Buss",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Reddog7,"On a Nook, the search did not describe this book as one of several volumes. It starts on chapter XLVII. The scan of the book is horrible, rendering the story illegible. For example, it starts with this sentence, reproduced exactly as it appears on a Nook; ""~F the Count of Moiito-Oristo harl lived for a very long time ill Parisian society, lie would liavo fully appreciated the value of the stej* wluflh M. do ViUefort had taken."" I'm not going to waste any time on this book. I'm not going to waste any more time on reviewing this junk."
103,The Count of Monte Cristo,0140449264,"Alexandre Dumas, Robin Buss",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"This is an abridged version -- an incomplete story -- and a terrible abridged version.  There are several key parts of the story missing, which significantly change the story.  It is an offense to Dumas and readers."
104,The Road,0307265439,Cormac McCarthy,Barnes and Noble,4,Jessi-21,"The dark side of fiction is here in this interesting story. I really enjoyed reading it. Though I had to read this story as a reading assignment, I am glad I did. This fictional drama will stay with me forever. I highly recommend this story to anyone."
104,The Road,0307265439,Cormac McCarthy,Barnes and Noble,4,CinBake,"This was one of those literary works that I really didn't WANT to read but did beccause it was a Pulitzer winner - so often we get in a rut of reading just the genres that appeal to us most.  Boy, was I glad I ""branched out"" with this one.  I couldn't put it down and it stayed with me for days after I finished.  While it's not exactly entertaining, it was a MUST read for everyone who appreciates characters with depth and a plot that will make you look inward.  WONDERFUL book that I'm certain I'll read again in a few years and appreciate it just as much."
104,The Road,0307265439,Cormac McCarthy,Barnes and Noble,4,TeachLH,"Cormac McCarthy's The Road speaks to the hopeful part of all humans; the part that whispers to us that we are not alone, that even in the bleakest of times, there is possibility and promise.  
Some see this book as a warning of a fast approaching post-apocalyptic time when all life as we know it will be turned topsy turvy and basic human kindness will be swept away as pockets of people strive to survive.  And, I suppose, The Road could be described as such, but as the famed glass half empty or half full discussion, what you take from reading The Road surely will depend on what you bring to the reading.  The boy in this poignant story is a waning ray of faith whose optimism is juxtaposed against the realistic father who has been hardened by devastation and loss. This is a story of love, loss, and life but whether you are left comforted or frustrated depends on your own belief of mankind and life after life.  A litmus test of a book - you will find insight into your own beliefs."
105,"Allegiant (Divergent, #3)",0007524277,Veronica Roth,Barnes and Noble,3.4,Anonymous,"Don't waste your time with the third book.  After counting down for the last year in eager anticipation of the release of the third installment, I happily gave up my evening to read the finale.  Now, four hours later, I'm left feeling bewildered, confused and betrayed by the contrived end to this series.  Some may call it gutsy, but I fail to see the point.  What a disappointment after such a strong start."
105,"Allegiant (Divergent, #3)",0007524277,Veronica Roth,Barnes and Noble,3.4,Anonymous,"Having read the first two books in this series several times, I have been awaiting the day for Allegiant to come out. I started reading the morning it came out and by the end of the day I was in tears. I read through to the end of all of the acknowledgements thinking there had to be an error, that it all was a dream. 
Having read the last 50 or so pages with tears running down my face, I got up and left the room, and actually started all out crying. I knew that I would never read this book again, but I also knew that I would not be able to read Divergent and Insurgent again knowing the outcome of the 3rd book. I no longer had a desire to read the short stories from Tobias' pov, or even see the movie that I have been so excited about seeing.
I have no idea why V.Roth would chose to alienate her audience and sabotage a movie that hasn't come out yet. Most authors, I assumed wanted to have successful and lucrative careers. If you want to write the strory that appeals to you...go ahead...keep it in your personal library. What you did was absolutely cruel.
I did wait a couple of days before posting this review, so that my emotions would settle a little. That said, the double point of view was confusing. On more than one instance I had to scroll to the beginning of the chapter to see who it was. She did not give as much care to her characters or as much detail as in the previous books. As the final book in the trilogy, we shouldn't have had things left unexplained or explored.
People don't read books to feel depressed and sad, they want to feel happy in the end. This reader will no longer be reading any of Ms. Roth's work...."
105,"Allegiant (Divergent, #3)",0007524277,Veronica Roth,Barnes and Noble,3.4,Anonymous,"I loved these books, but to have it end the way it did leaves a bad taste.  I feel like Roth took the easy way out in order to be true to the time she was writing about.  It would have been a greater challenge to her writing abilities to have a different ending that was true to the series, and I don't think she was up for the challenge.  Very disappointing."
106,Bossypants,0000000000,Tina Fey,Barnes and Noble,4.1,writingirl_15,"First off, I'm not a huge Tina Fey fan. I don't watch SNL and the only other shows I have seen her in are Date Night and Mean Girls. I don't hate her and I don't love her, she's somewhere in between. I was in Borders and I was completely book-less (a very sad state to be in) and just as I was about to leave the store, on a whim, I grabbed her book and bought it. And let me tell you, I'm glad I did. 

She chronicles her life with humor, dry wit (by the way, I never knew what that meant until I read Bossypants), and complete honesty. She talks about her family, her teen years, her job at the soul-sucking YMCA, her first OB/GYN visit, her almost fatal honeymoon, breast feeding, the creation of 30 Rock and so much more. It had me laughing out loud constantly, and thinking what an interesting life she's led. 

I really don't think you have to be a hardcore Tina Fey fan to enjoy this book. Bossypants was a hilarious and heartfelt book about life and its many weird/scary/fun and crappy adventures. I think most people can relate to her experiences in one way or the other. All in all, it was a blast reading about her life. I strongly recommend to anyone who likes autobiographies and comedy."
106,Bossypants,0000000000,Tina Fey,Barnes and Noble,4.1,mitochondrialeve,"I adore Tina Fey. This book could have been 300 pages of calling me a fat, spinster trash heap and I would have found it witty and insightful. But will this book appeal to anyone who doesn't already love Ms. Fey? Absolutely not. The awkward growing-up stories are run of this mill and didn't make me laugh. The book picked up when talking about the SNL/Sarah Palin/30 Rock days but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone but the most devoted Fey fans."
106,Bossypants,0000000000,Tina Fey,Barnes and Noble,4.1,EdmundDantes,"Let me start by saying I'm a huge Tina Fey fan. So, as soon as I heard about this book, I immediately downloaded it. I laughed through most of the book. I could go on and on about the parts I like, such as her answers to her internet naysayers, or her lifelong retorts to homophobes. But, if you got this book, you already know she's pretty funny. Here is my ONLY critique of a book I truly loved. She is waaaay too nice and gracious. Do I think Lorne Michaels gave her a great start and believed in her? Certainly. Do I think Alec Baldwin was a huge boon to her show and a mentor to her? You betcha. But the consummate ""thank you's"" and accolades to the big shots got long in the tooth for me. I preferred her praise of other writers, unsung heroes, as it were. That being said, I respect her very much and her right to tell her story in her own way on her own terms. This is merely my personal opinion, and not a cheap shot. So I'll wait till she's older and hopefully writes her memoirs - they always seem to provide a bit more insight into the person. I got a lot of ""Tina Fey - Funny Lady"" and would have preferred a little more insight into the ""Tina Fey - Actual Human Chick""."
107,A Walk to Remember,0446693804,Nicholas Sparks,Barnes and Noble,4.6,morgancheer1123,"A Walk to Remember is the most heartfelt and touching story you will ever pick up. It as an engaging book that anyone could get into. The different personalities of the two main characters, Jamie Sullivan and Landon Carter, will make you want to read on forever. This is no classic love story, but a story that could touch anyone's heart. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone. In fact, after you read the book, go see the movie! It is even better on film. :)"
107,A Walk to Remember,0446693804,Nicholas Sparks,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"Funy how things work, I too have been diagnosed with a fatal disease. I am with the man I fell in love with when were 17, after a decade and a half years later. 
We always loved eachother but unfortunate events happened back then causing us to lose contact. We reunited after he found me on facebook and read my profile. He was shocked to learn of my illness, but he still wanted to be with me, even after all these years, even though I am sick and we won't grow old together. I love him very very much. 
I must admit, this story has given me the inspiration to marry my truest love! We plan on doing it, but private. That is where Jamie and me differ, I don't like crowds! Of course, I am not a Saint like her character is either, though people cannot understand why I am so cheerful, optimistic, and happy. I say it is because you have to believe in hope and never let yourself get down or you will just get sicker that much faster.
Nicholas Sparks hits the nail right on the head with this incredible story! 
Believe, hope, faith and love!"
107,A Walk to Remember,0446693804,Nicholas Sparks,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"¿In every way, a walk to remember.¿ In A Walk to Remember, by Nicholas Sparks, seventeen year-old Landon Carter is a senior at Beaufort high school. Every year, the high school and the local Baptist church puts on the play The Christmas Angel written by the minister of the church. The play features seniors. Landon gets casts as the male lead role, while his opposite is Jamie Sullivan, the minister¿s daughter. Jamie is not accepted by her classmates. She carries around a bible and is extremely religious. Jamie and Landon start spending most of their time together. They even go to the homecoming dance together. Landon learns of Jamie¿s dream and all Landon wants to do is to fulfill it. This realistic fiction novel was amazingly well written which is expected from Nicholas Sparks. The book pulls you in right away. The way Sparks writes this novel as a memory is a great way of telling a story. The way he describes Beaufort, North Carolina, it feels like you have been there a thousand times.This was a fun book that I really enjoyed. A Walk to Remember was a fast read that I didn¿t put down. A great book for ages 12 and up. This story is about Landon and Jamie who accidently fall in love. Landon is a bad boy and Jamie is a goody two shoes that goes to church. Landon pulls a prank on a kid and gets him put in the hospital and Landon has to do community service hours, so he gets assigned to a play at the school that Jamie helps him with. At first he just wants it to be over, but like every good story there¿s a twist. Jamie has a secret, will she tell him? This book is one of the best books I have ever read, no joke, I would defiantly suggest this book, I didn't put it down once. Will Jamie tell Landon her secret? Will they get married? Will they go their separate ways? Read this astonishing book, A Walk to Remember. A defiant book that I would want my children to read, very good heart warming, tear jerking, story."
108,"Confessions of a Shopaholic (Shopaholic, #1)",0440241413,Sophie Kinsella,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"Tuesdays with Morrie was a coping with death self-help book in disguise...Bridget Jones's Diary was a relationship self-help book in diguise...and Confessions of a Shopaholic is a financial self-help book in disguise.

It'll make you laugh out load and you won't be able to put it down, unless there's a 50% off sale at Harrod's, hehe, so I strongly urge you to pick up this book at your local Barnes and Noble, mine was 20% so in a sense I was actually saving money, hehe, maybe get a reg. mocha frap w/ whip cream and choc. oh but must watch diet..

108,"Confessions of a Shopaholic (Shopaholic, #1)",0440241413,Sophie Kinsella,Barnes and Noble,4.1,XXXOOOBookwormOOOXXX,"onfessions of A Shopaholic is a cute and witty story about something more of us would probably care to admit to. The allure of tempting eye-candy all around us in whatever your particular weakness is (in Rebecca's case FASHION) and the ease of charging it to a credit card. It's panic time when the bills come in and Rebecca knows how to creatively dodge the bill collectors. Throw in a little romantic comedy and you are hooked on Rebecca's story. I really enjoyed it and want to read Sophia Kinsella's other books. I really enjoyed this book, it was hard to believe someone could be so addicted to shopping, it was entertaining. he interplay of characters is what makes the book enjoyable, from Becky's roommate, to Luke, to the bank manager, to Becky's parents. They are real people and that makes the story enjoyable to me. The writing is also clever and overrides the obnoxiousness that Becky occasionally engenders. The first book in the series is a good start and makes a good foundation, leaving room for growth. If you're looking for a light read, give it a try!"

109,Les Miserables,0451525264,"Victor Hugo, Lee Fahnestock, Norman MacAfee",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"This book is truly a masterpiece.  The reader is absolutely drawn in by the characters.  I adore books that make me cry because I know that then, I am definately involved.  For this book, I bawled!

110,"A Clash of Kings  (A Song of Ice and Fire, #2)",0553381695,George R.R. Martin,Barnes and Noble,4.6,JGolomb,"Many editorial reviews of book (or movie) sequels claim that the second is as good as, or better than, the original. I read the same thing about ""A Clash of Kings"", George R.R. Martin's sequel to ""A Game of Thrones"". I was a bit skeptical, I mean...how can one not question whether Martin could duplicate what he accomplished in the first novel, let alone better it. ""Thrones"" is magnificently expansive and epic...how could book 2 match the energy and intensity?

Martin absolutely knocked the ball out of the park with ""Clash"". I don't know if it's better than ""Thrones"", but it's easily its equal. He takes the core set of surviving characters (Arya, Sansa, Bran, Catelyn, Jon, Cersei and the wonderfully rich Tyrion), and picks up almost immediately where ""Thrones"" left off. And I don't just mean in terms of plot, but also in building out his fantastic world of intrigue, adventure and politics. 

""Clash"" is complicated, intense and absolutely epic. It sprawls majestically over a widely varied physical and literary landscape. The politics within the plot, focused on four Kings battling over a land that's used to having only one, are intricate, but not difficult to follow. Martin's writing is clear, his dialogue is smooth and the interplay between characters is enjoyable and completely in sync with the overall tone and 'place' of the story. The book is very serious and heavy - at about 1,000 pages, the book is actually heavy, but I love the weightiness, with corresponding depth, of the story.

Like ""Thrones"", there's not a ton of fantasy in ""Clash"". It's very middle-ages-historical-fiction with a tinge of supernatural. There's more fantasy in this book than in the first, though, and it feels like it'll build into much more for the third book. There are dragons, but they set up a certain tone and act more as a plot device than anything else. There's no fire-breathing and attacking and destroying. There's further development around Bran's supernatural connection with his direwolf Summer, and we see that the bastard Stark, Jon, has a bit of the gift as well. There are a few more fantastical devices scattered throughout the book, which Martin develops slowly through his world's mythology rather than hammering in a slew of de facto dungeons & dragons.

The characters are Martin's true accomplishment. He feeds off a character's strengths and deficiencies, and each one is perfectly human and in some way relate-able. Individuals-as-'outsiders', is the base upon which the best characters are built. And he uses that foundation frequently. Tyrion, the dwarf prince, has become one of my favorite and most memorable characters in the series, and perhaps one of the most well-developed characters in any popular fiction. He's witty and smart, and sometimes obnoxiously flip. But his deep-seated insecurities which evolve slowly over the course of both of the first books make his chapters the most anticipated. Arya develops into a wonderfully three dimensional character as the tomboy princess cut off from her family, trying to survive and find a way back home. Sansa's princess-ly arrogance dissipates under the strain of trying to survive as a hostage, and finds friends in very un-princess-ly places. 

I'm looking forward to seeing HBO's creation of Martin's world of Ice and Fire coming this spring. Until then, I'll start digging into book 3 - ""A Storm of S"
110,"A Clash of Kings  (A Song of Ice and Fire, #2)",0553381695,George R.R. Martin,Barnes and Noble,4.6,GloveSlipper,"Let me first state that I love this series. These books are wonderful for escaping on a snowy night. The characters, good or bad, continue to forge a place in your heart. The books have everything you would want from a work of fiction, except.

This series is sad. Without any specific spoilers I can say that there is not one thing that has happened in this series that makes you feel good. Even when a character falls in love there is an underlying issue that makes the love a bad idea. The characters you care about are put through one horrific event after another and most of the characters are children. I know the series is far from finished but at this point, every single chapter you can rest assured that the characters you love will have nothing good happen to them. 

Read this series but take a break in between books. There is no rush as the author has very little interest in finishing the series quickly. Otherwise, the chapters begin to feel like a depressing grind."
110,"A Clash of Kings  (A Song of Ice and Fire, #2)",0553381695,George R.R. Martin,Barnes and Noble,4.6,thecollector0,"this is a good but very advanced series with many characters that you want to follow to find out more of the story. I thoroughly enjoyed this book as well as the others in the series, and again cannot wait to read the next one."
111,The Memory Keeper's Daughter,0143037145,Kim Edwards,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Guest,I've read a lot of people being disappointed in this book and then some who loved it. It all depends on what your looking for. The book was not what I was looking for but it was still a good book.   I read to escape every day life and disappointments and this book puts you in real life. It was very sad and depressing to see how lies and regrets will affect your future. I was crying by the time the book was done.   Don't get me wrong its a good story but very sad and depressing.
111,The Memory Keeper's Daughter,0143037145,Kim Edwards,Barnes and Noble,3.5,1Katherine1,"The Memory Keeper's Daughter is a book that should be savored. Each paragraph is awash in beautiful imagery and the phrasing is glorious. I found myself rereading paragraphs to fully appreciate the imagery.
The story is heart-wrenching. I have found myself with a new insight into people suffering from Down's Syndrome. I will never look at them in the same way again.
The characters are real, and the reader can feel the anguish, joy, heartache and struggles that can be the result of one decision made on one night. At any moment, we can experience a moment that can change our lives forever.
A must read!"
111,The Memory Keeper's Daughter,0143037145,Kim Edwards,Barnes and Noble,3.5,vlf1493,"The ink spilling out of an author's pen, spreading on a blank piece of paper, fresh, spontaneous, like the accidental pattern footprints make on the clean slate that is a sandy shore. Each individual pairs up words with their own finesse, secretly wishing a successful outcome.  American author Kim Edwards excels in her first novel ""The memory keeper's daughter"" in more ways than one. With the intriguing plot, mesmerizing descriptiveness and as a whole the heartwarming message the story leaves behind.
	David Henry, a work-driven doctor has the miraculous ability and luck to deliver his own twins from the love of his life, Norah. When the second baby, a girl, is delivered, due to his lucid knowledge on medicine, he instantly realizes the peculiar features which make her fit into the category of a baby with down syndrome. With the intention of sparing her wife the pain, he gives it to the nurse Caroline and tells her to take her to an institute for mentally challenged children, planning to tell Norah the baby girl was a still birth. When Caroline arrives to the institute, she makes the decision of keeping the baby, Phoebe, due to the pitiful conditions of the institute. This turn Caroline takes leads to every possible problem that could have ever been thought of.
	From the very first page of this best selling novel, I was captured by the story, feeling and anticipating what each character was going through. With the plot revolving around such a delicate subject, children with Down syndrome, the powerful, emotional blizzard the author strikes us with is inevitable. Another key element that propels this book is the change in character perspective the author lets us perceive. With the conflict having two completely different angles, through perspective alternation we get to live beside different characters struggling with different aspects of one same problem. This novel also helps us as the readers, get the flexibility of supporting whichever side of the conflict we best relate with, not only with what the usual one-voice narrator or speaker is expressing.
	I also praise Kim Edwards greatly for her incredible vocabulary. The way she uses words to drown the reader in her story is impressive and not very common in novels. While reading the back of my book before actually starting to read it, I noticed how all the reviews from the most acknowledged sources esteemed Edward's way of describing to the finest detail each aspect, character, setting and situation of her story. She proved them right, and satisfied my expectations.
	Last but not least I can't ignore the deep message this novel conveys. From beginning to end the story circles around this one innocent little girl, tagged by society as a mongoloid, or a child suffering from Down syndrome. With David, the main character and her father, giving her away, various conflicts appear as a domino effect, deceit, affairs, redemption, secrets and more. The resolution to all this conflict leads to the simple lesson of love before interest.
	In conclusion, I recommend this phenomenal piece of work to all in search of a thrilling novel full of emotion, description and intriguing moments. Kim Edwards' way of writing is hypnotic. I assure anyone who succumbs to reading it will not be disappointed."
112,"Me Before You (Me Before You, #1)",0670026603,Jojo Moyes,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Dollycas,"Louisa Clark (Lou) is just an ordinary woman leading her life, living with and helping to take care of her parents and grandfather. Then the job she loves at the cafe is gone. The owner has closing and moved away. Jobs are hard to come by and she tries a few. Then she is convinced to become a companion/caregiver to Will Traynor. A man who was a daredevil and astute businessman that has been sidelined by an accident the caused damage to his spinal cord. He is now in a wheelchair and can only move one hand slightly. Will is acerbic, moody, bossy&mdash;but Lou refuses to treat him with kid gloves, and soon his happiness means more to her than she expected. When she learns that Will has shocking plans of his own, she sets out to show him that life is still worth living.
 



I couldn't wait to dive into this book. I had only read a small synopsis sent by the publicist before I started reading. I knew the man in the story was paralyzed but didn't really give it more than a passing thought until I read about his injury. His damage to his spine was in the C5-6 area, the exact same place as my injury. He is confined to a wheelchair with very little movement. This could have been me. I was lucky to have paralysis only claim one side of my body. This did give me pause but I continued reading. Will Traynor went through the same feelings and doubt and uncertainty that I did and still sometimes have. But he did do something I could never do. He decided to have 6 months with his family and then he would end his life at a assisted suicide clinic in  Switzerland. Lou will do anything to get him to change his mind. To say this book affected me deeply in an understatement.

Jojo Moyes has written a brilliant story that was well researched. She incorporates spinal injury online support groups to help Lou understand what Will is going through. From experience I know the snippets in the book are credible. She has included a caregiver that takes care of the more personal and medical needs for Will so that Lou is more of a friend or companion at least at first.

She has also created a wonderful cast of supporting characters. Lou&rsquo;s lower class family, working hard every day to try to keep up. Her sister, the family favorite, with her own personal battles. Lou&rsquo;s boyfriend who has suddenly become a fitness guru. Then there is Will&rsquo;s family. Upper middle class with a huge house and plenty of money. But even with their son&rsquo;s disability aside, were they ever happy? I truly enjoyed the chapters when other characters took over and gave their perspective. We were able to get a deeper vision of their thoughts and impressions of  their lives as well as their feelings about Lou and Will.

This was not a book that I could rush through but I feel that is because of my personal issues with the story. I found myself setting the book aside because some parts were so powerful or when I found myself actually crying so much the words were blurred. It is not your run of the mill love story. Feelings grew in ways that I didn't even imagine. I don&rsquo;t want to ruin the end for anyone but I was truly hoping for a different outcome. I understood, but as a person who has actually looked death in the eye and came back, life is just too precious to me.

An intense story, I highly recommend you have a box of tissues handy."

113,Catch-22,0684833395,Joseph Heller,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"I'm not going to talk about the content of the book. People have covered that.

The NookBook of Catch-22 was generated from a scanned manuscript and then insufficiently copyedited. To pick one example, words that begin with ""Li"" are frequently rendered with a ""U"" instead; so, say, ""Lip"" becomes ""Up."" It happened often enough to be distracting.

Considering we're asked to pay MORE than the paperback price for the NookBook, and we can't return the NookBook for being shoddy, this is unacceptable."
113,Catch-22,0684833395,Joseph Heller,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"When I think of the term ""war story,"" I tend to think of the long grueling battles, the wounded dying in the mud, or the sounds of guns blasting in the distance. However, in Joseph Heller's great novel, Catch-22, the most significant and my favorite scenes are ones not on the battlefield; they are the ones at camp. The ingenious (yet sometimes confusing) plot is centered around the main character in this novel, Yossarian, who has seen the inhumane and thoughtless actions of his superiors during the second half of WWII. He is an air force pilot stationed in the Mediterranean Sea conducting bombing raids that seem to never end. After enduring one mission after another, he stumbles on a way to be discharged from service if he is deemed insane. His never-ending search to get out of the military and his conversations with his friend Nately are humorous and entertaining. However, when Yossarian first claims to be ""insane,"" he proves to the doctors that he truly IS sane because anyone who is really sane would want to be discharged. This confusing paradox, or circular reasoning, is Catch-22. Catch-22 is described in many other ways, mostly in other nearly incomprehensible paradoxes that ""catches"" its subject in its illogic, and always allows the government complete control over the pilots' lives. The theme of total power to the government can also be found in some other side stories (and flashbacks that happen at unspecified times) throughout the novel, such as when Officer Minderbinder can make himself immense amounts of cash just by trading amongst the companies he himself owns. You find yourself rooting for the soldiers, and wonder why they must die.  I thought Yossarian's struggles with the law Catch-22 as amusing as no matter where you went, or which way, the government always ended up on top. And as the war goes on, Yossarian witnesses more tragedies among his men- murder, death, rape, and disease. When he is arrested in the streets of Rome, he is given a choice; Stay in the Air Force, or be honorably discharged. But there's a cache, if he is discharged, his men in his squadron must fly another eighty missions. Will Yossarian be tempted to regain a life of his own, and yet endanger the lives of his own men? Or will he continue to fly under the rule of Catch-22? Although the plot is hard to comprehend at first, is you persevere through the confusing flashbacks and characters whose names you forget, it will all make sense in the end."
113,Catch-22,0684833395,Joseph Heller,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Way_of_the_Carl,"Catch 22 is a classic novel that comes around every ten years or so that delivers a story so out of the ordinary and yet so real that everyone who loves to read should pick this title up.  Not only did this book create a phrase that has lasted the ages it makes you think what could have been if...Even though thinking this way will only get you in trouble because of the Catch 22 you find yourself in.  Joseph Heller brings to the table a dainty group of soldiers who believe someone is trying to kill them and that they are going to die, even though they don't want to.  The dialog back and forth is outrageous and hilarious, making one wonder how would I react if I was stuck in the same situation.I found this classic easy to read and understand, rooting for the soldiers to come back home asking myself ""Why do they have to die?"", even if they don't.  You'll love Heller's creation of a wayside group of individuals vying to survive in a outfit of misfits who can't seem to get along.  He delivers solid dialog and great storytelling, running the reader through the muck of unmotivated soldiers all trying their hardest to survive."
114,Tuesdays with Morrie,0751529818,"Mitch Albom, Saulius Dagys",Barnes and Noble,4.6,J_Hargrove,"I hate reading with a passion. When I had to read a book for English class i really didn't like the idea of having to read a book. When my teacher explained the story of this book i was actually looking forward to reading it. When i read the first sentence i knew that it was going to be a good book. from the front cover to the back cover it took me back to my child hood and the people i have lost in my life. I was amazed that one person lived so On the edge and really didn't care about the details of life, Morrie lived life like he wanted to and didn't care of what other people thought. This is how everyone should live their life the way Morrie did. When i got to the last day or time they saw each together and Morrie couldn't talk and as Mitch said ""Whispering"" it reminded me of me and my grandpa talking to each other for the last time. I HAVE NEVER EVER CRIED OVER A BOOK!! This book made me cry I'm a 15 year old kid who doesn't have emotions. This book is a great read and I recommend it to anyone who doesn't like to read. This is a book that you do not want to put down. It changed my way of looking at life and i hope it changes yours :)"
114,Tuesdays with Morrie,0751529818,"Mitch Albom, Saulius Dagys",Barnes and Noble,4.6,Lauren-A,"Although death is a constant subject, the novel Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom is actually a book about life. It's a true story about what happens when an insightful and brilliant professor conrtacts the fatal disease ALS, and the way one of his students from years ago stayed with him until the end.
This book is so personal because Mitch's voice shows you his deepest and most personal thoughts. Also, the main character and the author share a name. this gives off a feeling of actually being there. Morrie was Mitch's farvorite college professor. When Mitch learns about Morrie's illness, he begins meeting with him every Tuesday to talk. Mitch is so touched by Morrie's insights and thoughts on life that he feels as if no time at all has passed since he was Morrie's student in college. At the beginning of the story, Mitch cared more about about money and his job than his wife or being a good person. After meeting with Morrie, he doesnt care so much about answering his cell phone, he lets himself think about life, and, well, he writes bestselling novels.
Morrie gives insights on life, love, forgiveness, wants and needs, anything Mitch needs to talk about. As the end for him becomes closer and closer, he becomes more and more accepting. As his disease takes over, slowly looses control of his body. First he can't walk, then can't lift his arms, or finally eat solid food, until he is just a useless lump. He doesnt see it this way, though. He doesn't want pity; he wants people to visit him, to call him, to tell him about their problems. Sometimes, it seems like Morrie has an answer for everything. He doesn't like the way our culture is in such a hurry. He thinks people should slow down and take the time to live life. i think this is the most important lesson that Mitch learned from Morrie, and the most important lesson everyone can learn from reading this book, and the most important lesson everyone can learn from reading this book. This book doesnt give off a sad, depressing feeling, though. It takes the heavy subject of death and keeps it in a pretty light tone. Life is too short to keep rushing through it. Take the time out of your busy life to read this book."

115,Middlesex,0312422156,Jeffrey Eugenides,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"Very interesting read. On the surface, a story about a Greek-American hermaphrodite. Calliope/Cal narrates this tale of birth and rebirth.Cal describes the family history and traces the journey of a rare, recessive gene over about 80 years. Cal's grandparents flee from their burning home in a small village in Turkey. Desdemona and Lefty, brother and sister, reinvent themselves during their journey to America and get married. When their son marries his cousin, two recessive genes collide. The result? Calliope, raised as a girl until an emergency room doctor notices something different about her. A visit to a famous specialist in New York sets Calliope on a completely new path and she is reborn as Cal.Excellent character development and the intricate details of Cal's convoluted family history will keep readers turning pages. The normal adolescent angst and sexual exploration take on a whole new dimension, yet these issues are handled with grace, sensitivity, and, often, humor.I did not expect to like this book, as it was on my ""have to read"" list, rather than the ""want to read"" list. Nevertheless, Cal's story grabbed me from the very first lines. I found this to be an excellent read."
115,Middlesex,0312422156,Jeffrey Eugenides,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Lisa_RR_H,"I loved this novel. I picked up this fat tome with some trepidation, hearing it was inspired by a memoir discovered and promoted by Foucault by and about a hermaphrodite. I pictured some post-modern turgid avant-garde mess--like Delillo's Underworld, which had been on the same recommendation list. Instead I found what was promised in Underworld's blurbs was fulfilled in Middlesex--a Great American Novel--and a page-turner.

Strangely, in the tale of a hermaphrodite I didn't find anything remotely freakish, but humanely universal, as if by having this protagonist of an ambiguous gender, Eugenides was able to embrace and bridge both (all?) genders. It's an ambitious work, taking in about 80 years from his Greek immigrant grandparents roots in Turkey, to his parents and childhood in Detroit, to his coming of age on the road from New York City to San Francisco and his current life at a diplomatic posting in Germany. It takes in massacres in Turkey, Ellis Island, the development of America's car culture, Prohibition with it's Speakeasies and bootlegging, The Great Depression, World War II, The Nation of Islam, Detroit race riots and Black/White relations, the sexual revolution, politics, religion--there doesn't seem anything missed, and yet nothing that feels rambling or contrived or caricatured.

The voice is miraculous. Technically it's a first person narrative, but it breaks the bonds of that point of view into an expansive omniscience in telling its story of three generations: Book One dealing with his grandparents in Turkey and their immigration to Detroit; Book Two with the story of his grandparents and parents in Detroit before his birth; Book Three with his childhood and early adolescence; Book Four with his crisis of identity when doctors discover he's not the girl he was raised to be. Even in those two parts of the book during his own lifetime, the narration has that expansive, feel of third person omniscience, but with the intimacy of the first person voice.

Eugenides makes me feel for his characters. I ached for Callie--and Cal--both. I worried for him. I hoped for him. I was propelled through the 500 pages not wanting to skip one paragraph and ended it sorry it was over and wanting to read this again sometime--and Eugenides other novel."
115,Middlesex,0312422156,Jeffrey Eugenides,Barnes and Noble,4.2,mL_i_B,"&ldquo;I was born twice: first, as a baby girl, on a remarkably smogless Detroit day in January 1960; and then again, as a teenage boy, in an emergency room near Petoskey, Michigan, in August of 1974.&rdquo; Jeffrey Eugenides draws the reader into Middlesex in just the first sentence, and sets the scene for the purpose of the novel. Immediately, the reader is aware that the main character, later named Cal/Calliope, is a hermaphrodite. This is interesting because, BAM, within the book&rsquo;s first few words the most shocking information about the story is already revealed. Eugenides could have decided to keep this information quiet and completely shock the reader in the middle of the novel when an emergency room technician discovers Cal&rsquo;s embarrassing truth. However, due to other elements in the story, this strategy would not have been nearly as satisfying. Middlesex is a story of controversy, a story of history, a story of secrets, a story of coming of age. All of which are tied together beautifully. 
	The novel takes a historical, twisting path from Greece in the 1920&rsquo;s to 1960&rsquo;s Detroit and 1970&rsquo;s San Francisco. The story begins by telling Cal&rsquo;s Grandparents&rsquo; history. This occupies a good part of the novel; and I feel if the reader was unaware of Cal&rsquo;s abnormalities they would be questioning why she was going into such detail with their life story. This is why revealing Cal&rsquo;s predicament in the first sentence works so well. It is ALWAYS in the back of the reader&rsquo;s mind. The reader is compelled to find out more about Cal&rsquo;s sexuality, and why she is like the way she is. Watching her deal with her unique problems makes the novel a one of a kind, modern coming of age tale. 
	Cal also periodically interjects parts of her current life into the novel, which takes place in modern day Europe. Again, the fact that the reader knows of Cal&rsquo;s troubles makes these parts understandable. However, these sections of the book did not click with me. At one point in the story Cal travels cross country (don&rsquo;t worry, this does not give away much) and during this journey, I began to question her survival. But, because of the constant interjection of her current life, I knew that death was not an option. My imagination could not run wild. These pieces also called for a complete change of gears, which i was not fond of. One moment I was on a boat somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean in the 1920&rsquo;s, and the next I was on a subway during the twentieth century. It would have added another element of surprise to the story if Cal&rsquo;s current life was talked about at the end. 
	Nevertheless, the story contains many layers. This is satisfying because just as the story has different elements, so does the idea of hermaphroditism. Eugenides constantly adds in historical events, such as the fire in Smyrna, Turkey. He also adds even greek culture by paralleling Cal&rsquo;s story with that of Greek myths. He tells a classic story of immigrants coming to America, while also revealing a modern story about a hermaphrodite. This contrast is written so beautifully. Which is why the story of an uncomfortable topic actually works well. The novel is not just about a Hermaphrodite. Middlesex is about history, about Greek culture, about family secrets, about adventures, about acceptance."
116,The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,0143039563,"Mark Twain, Guy Cardwell, John Seelye",Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"This book is about two boys named Tom and Huck.  They heard about a treasure buried somewhere.   They are trying to find out where the treasure is buried but they have a little problem--other people are looking for the treasure too. Injun Joe is also looking for the treasure and he is the meanest person that no one likes.  One night Tom and Huck were walking in a grave yard and saw Injun Joe kill a guy. So now Tom and Huck are scared of Injun Joe.  Then Tom ran away to an island because he wanted to try living on his own.  Everyone in the town thought Tom and Huck died, but they didn¿t.  On the day of their funeral they showed up and surprised all the grown ups.  Do they find the treasure?  Read and find out. This was an easy book to read because it was short.  I liked this book because it had a lot of adventure."
116,The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,0143039563,"Mark Twain, Guy Cardwell, John Seelye",Barnes and Noble,4,Mark Strack,"I read this book to my 6 year old daughter and she loved it. Keep in mind it's been rewritten and shortened up for a younger audience, but it was a great way to get her interested in the classics. We've read many from the series and have not once been disappointed."
116,The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,0143039563,"Mark Twain, Guy Cardwell, John Seelye",Barnes and Noble,4,Trevor_,"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain is a very enthralling novel. It is about an imaginative young boy, Tom Sawyer who can be very mischievous but is naturally ""good"", instead of his half brother Sid, or the novel's antagonist, Injun Joe. He begins the story as a manipulative young rebel, which is demonstrated when he swindles his classmates into whitewashing a fence that he was originally punished to do, in exchange for small treasures. Tom, captivated with stories of pirates and other rebels, leads him and his friends in a series of adventures, from playing battles to running away to an island to create a pirate crew. As the adventures become more serious and dangerous, Tom becomes more and more mature. After witnessing a murder, and testifying against the killer, Injun Joe, Tom and Huckleberry Finn fear for their lives while treasure hunting, and they both display heroics that ultimately result into their ""real"" maturation into adulthood. Twain, throughout the story satirizes the hypocrisy of most adult institutions, such as the church, Sunday school, regular school and the temperance tavern. He views that adults are hypocritical and pretentious, possessing a certain ""false maturity"". This ""false"" maturity is defined by the moral maturity a person or institution has. For example, the temperance tavern, which is not supposed to serve alcohol, has a secret back room that does just that. By the end of the novel, Tom changed from attempting to undermine all authority, into a defender of the respectable adult society, displaying the truest sense of moral maturity, even though he was still not very old. Tom first explores superstitions with Huck, and soon becomes dependant on them. They created so many beliefs that in any uncertain situation, such as when they were in the haunted mansion, they can provide reassurance and confidence in one's self. Rebellion is prevalent within the novel. Tom and his friends commit crimes and disobey their parents, but they never are geared at hurting any other people. These minor rebellions could never lead to worse crimes, because Tom and the boys felt deep remorse only for stealing small amounts of bacon. These rebellious adventures for Tom lead to his praise within the community, like when he returns from Jackson's Island and shows up at his own funeral, only to be greeted with hugs. Injun Joe however, commits crimes that are obviously harmful to others such as murder, and finally dies, which shows that Twain condemns crimes that are harmful to others. I strongly recommend this intriguing book, although at times it can be hard to follow."

117,"A Wrinkle in Time (A Wrinkle in Time Quintet, #1)",0440498058,Madeleine L'Engle,Barnes and Noble,4.3,SuperGrrl,"This classic tale of Meg and her brother Charles Wallace has been in my subconscious ever since I read it when I was a child.  The themes of good versus evil, the hero being a young misfit girl who I could readily identify with, all gave me hope that I would one day be someone who could make a difference (although I didn't see how).  This book is more than just a book - it is a message that ""everything is going to be all right"" without sugarcoating the evil that lurks outside and without hiding the fact that you, the next generation, is what has to fight it.  A MUST READ for every YA reader.  If it wasn't on my Nook, I'd sleep with it under my pillow."
118,The Joy Luck Club,0143038095,Amy Tan,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"The Joy Luck Club is a story that portrays the different vignettes of four tenacious Chinese immigrant mothers and their first generation strong American daughters. As a first generation Chinese myself, I could immediately relate to some of the difficulties that the daughters faced, and many of the vignettes of the mothers reminded me of my parents/grandparents stories. The story also gives the reader a glimpse into the life of a typical Chinese lady in the 20th century and introduces the reader to Chinese culture and society.

           In the book, the daughters often try to be free from the constant nagging of the mother's, and one of the daughters even views her mother as an obstacle she must overcome, her own personal battle. I could really relate to the hard time that the daughters faced, because I myself am used to having my grandpa always comment on everything I do. His complaining would often leave me feeling imprisoned and constrained. I just wanted to get away from everything and anything that had to do with my family. However, through the course of this book I came to realize that the nitpicking of the older generation was just their own unique way of showing their love for their children.

            Many times, the Chinese daughters are often left confused by their mother's messages. The daughters cannot relate and understand the underlying meaning because of the different cultures that the mothers and daughters come from. While the Chinese culture is a high context culture the American culture is the polar opposite, a low context culture. Often times, the clashing of cultures would lead to confusion and frustration on both sides. I think that another reason why the mothers and daughters have such a difficult time understanding each other is because of the completely different environments that they grew up in. The mother's faced sexism, racism, and the struggle to just simply survive. Often times, the things that they learned growing up became important symbols and lessons that they hoped to pass down to their children.  But to the daughters who grew up  in an environment where they tried to hide their roots as much as possible, and being Asian was ""unfashionable"", these messages only helped to widen the gap between mother and daughter. The book illustrates the journey that the mothers and daughters faced trying to understand the different cultures and perspectives of the Chinese and American way of thinking.

            Chinese people prize filial piety above all other characteristics, and I remember often having to go to temples to pay my respects to my ancestors and that I could not talk back to my elders. In one of the stories, the Joy Luck Club is having a crab dinner. Since everyone immediately grabbed the largest and juiciest crabs, the hosts, Suyuan (mother), and Jing-mei (daughter), are left with the last two crabs. Jing-mei knows that one of the crabs was dead before they bought it, which is bad luck in Chinese culture, so she willingly grabs the dead crab so that her mother may enjoy the tastier crab. This is a very good example of filial piety, while everyone else is greedy, and hopes for the best for themselves, the daughter is being respectful by leaving the better crab for her mother. I specifically remembered this story from the book because I think that if I was in the same position as Jing-mei I would have taken the better crab for myself."

I'm a senior in high school and my english teacher gave it to me because we are going to read it later in the year but I read it early. I started on the first page and couldn't stop. I have never read a lot like this, I read all 336 pages in two days, in school, after school, whenever I had the chance. I LOVE the way Amy Tan wrote this book, the vignettes are so beautiful and touching. I found myself really feeling for the characters in the book.

119,The Handmaid's Tale,038549081X,Margaret Atwood,Barnes and Noble,4,constantreaderML,"Everyone should read this book. Period. Take it as a warning, of what CAN happen in the U.S., if religious extremism is allowed to infiltrate our society, and if Church and State don't stay separate. And keep in mind that Atwood took the social/political circumstances in the book from real situations that have happened or are happening somewhere in the world. The writing pulls the reader in, and even though the subject is terribly depressing, you just can't quit reading it. Now that I've finished it, I can't quit thinking about it. I want to read about it, and talk about it, and read more by the author. But I won't read it again for a long time, because it's plausibility is just too disturbing. Any author who can instill such strong emotions in her/his readers is a very talented writer."
119,The Handmaid's Tale,038549081X,Margaret Atwood,Barnes and Noble,4,andrewlin,"To categorize The Handmaid's Tale as another feminist piece of literature would be inaccurate, as it is really more. Like other novels that present visions of the world in the future, The Handmaid's tale imagines a dystopia that is all at once surreal and convincing, just as Orwell's 1984 or Huxley's Brave New World are. Though Offred's condition may appear unrealistic or even absurd at a glance, as the novel unfolds, Atwood reveals social circumstances shockingly real and in fact similar to our own."
119,The Handmaid's Tale,038549081X,Margaret Atwood,Barnes and Noble,4,FARIEQUEENE,"I picked up this book over a decade ago on a break in between classes while I was at school and bored.  I remember vividly reading the entire book in a day and re-reading the book so often that when I purchased my nook last December, ""The Handmaid's Tale"" was the first book I bought.  Atwood's glance at a sexist and distopian society is terrifying and the book makes a strong statement about what happens when the state has too much control.
The Red Dresses and Blue Dresses haunt me til this day, and yet I read the book over and over again when I cannot find anything else to tempt me."

In the story I felt that the pants truely were magical! Having bought this book at a secondhand thrift store for a $1.50 added even more magic :) Im a very picky reader but I was hooked from page one. I though it was going to be a sloppy, corny story, but I was wrong!! My cousin wouldn't shut up about it and told me that I just HAD to read it. I finished the book in about a day or two and I completely cried my eyes out in the end. Can't wait to read the other ones!! and maybe watch the movie too :) 
I loved the way the story was laid out. IT FORCES YOU TO KEEP READING!! One minute you're reading about Lena and then, it shifts over to Carmen, and then Tibby, and then Bridget, and back to Lena and so on... Oh! And in every chapter theres a cute little quote :) I loved it, some of them were funny too! I took this book to school with me and started reading in the cafeteria, and my friends looked at me like I was crazy cause I started crying. Why was I crying? 2 reasons: #1 I had finished reading it. #2 read the book and you'll see :) This book is absolutely PERFECT FOR THE SUMMER since it takes place during that time. I love books that just make me all emotional inside. Most people rate books with stars. I rate mine with tears. I cried soooo much in the end. 
There's always one character that you can relate to the most, but in this book you can relate to all of them in some ways :) I love Lena, we have the same taste and artistic skill and tend to be a little introverted. I loved Carmen too. We're both part Puerto Rican with some junk in the trunk and a broken family. Bridget and I share the same passion for soccer and Tibby and I have that little snappy attitude at times, we're not afraid to speak our mind, and we have crappy jobs with annoying bosses -_- In short :) quit wasting time reading stupid reviews about other peoples opinions about this book. Go out and buy it and read it. You won't regret it at all"

The beauty of the writing, the rhythmic flow of the descriptions, the tender gestures of the nymphet Dolores Haze, the subtlties of Nabokov's aliteration, the fluidness of instances, the sheer ability to run rapidly through dozens and dozens of scenes while keeping us 'or shall I say, Dear reader!' envisioned with Humbert, and his escapades around the America Vistas. The paradox, is here we have a book that revolts me in every physical way, but, the style, the rhythm, the cadence, the damn confidence! of Nabokov is enough to make me read on about our dear monster, and his Lolita!"

He then marries his landlord, Mrs. Haze, in order to stay close to her daughter, Dolores the nymphet. After finding out about Humbert's lust for her daughter, Mrs. Haze is killed when she runs out of her house in hysterics and is struck by a car. The rest of the book proceeds with Humbert and Lolita's travels across America. The book is from Humbert's perspective and gives the reader some insight into the mind of a pedophile. Humbert prohibits her from having a normal childhood, perhaps because she is not a normal child. The reader understands his lust for this particular young girl. Even though Humbert's obsession with Lolita is perverse, it is still tragic when he loses her to another pedophile. The reader actually feels sorry for Humbert, the truly pathetic character that he is. Lolita is a very interesting book and Nabokov wrote it well. It is by no means a comedy, yet in all the drama of Humbert and Lolita's illicit affair, I leave out love because by no means did she feel that towards him. The situations with Mrs. Haze do supply some comic relief to an altogether catastrophic story. I chose this book because it is a classic, and I feel the need to read the classics. There were parts of this book that I thoroughly enjoyed. The novel has all the makings of a great story, for it includes all the components love, hate, death, sexuality, deceit, and violence, which altogether make Lolita very absorbing. However, there are slow parts with continuous descriptions that seem to go on for pages. These detailed descriptions left me bored for some time as I read. I did enjoy the story line and I found the situation these two characters found themselves in fascinating. I sometimes got stuck in the slow parts and felt uninspired to continue. I would recommend Lolita to someone as long as they are prepared for what is in store: intrigue interrupted by ongoing attention to detail. Nabokov revolutionized literature by addressing a previously taboo topic, making way for this very situation to be depicted in movies, TV shows, and other literature."

122,"Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West (The Wicked Years, #1)",0060987103,"Gregory Maguire, Douglas Smith",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Codefox,"I saw the Broadway show in February and it was absolutely incredible.  Clearly I needed to read the book that this masterpiece was drawn from.  A play can only tell a small part of a story so the book had to be amazing.  Amazing is a word I would use to describe the book, certainly:

Amazingly boring.  Amazingly bad.  Amazingly pretentious.

I couldn't tell you what the plot was for this book.  Every time it seems like the author is going to give us a real plot, he whisks you away to some point in the future.  Be prepared to be left hanging.  A lot.

I was constantly waiting to find out more about things that happened in the book.  What was the group that Elphie was part of?  What did Madam Morrible really do to Glinda, Elphie, and Nessa?

Things just happen because we're told they happen.  Glinda and Elphie are friends, why?  Not relevant.  You just have to accept that they are.

The gratuitous sex scenes all seemed out of place as well.  Why did the author choose to write them?  Was it to shock the reader?  They added nothing to the story.  I suppose since I would argue there was no real story, that it would be impossible to add to it.  The author also had an obsession with urination.  I guess the denizens of Oz have bladder control issues.

This disjointed, plotless, lifeless excuse for a novel was all buried under flowery language.  I'm an avid reader and I have no trouble with big words.  But as boring as Wicked was, the writing style just made it even more painful to get through.

It was a painful trip from beginning to end.  Go see the musical.  They took the idea of what this story wanted to be and made it something exciting and fun.  There's a payoff at the end of the musical.  There's none at the end of Wicked, other than the fact you don't have to read it any longer."
122,"Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West (The Wicked Years, #1)",0060987103,"Gregory Maguire, Douglas Smith",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Moonbunnyperry,"As an avid fan of Wizard of Oz I was always told that ""Wicked"" would be a great follow up and new take on Oz. I became a fan of the musical adaptation of the book but was told they are greatly different. This fueled me wanting to read the book. It wasn't till recently that I finally did. The book is very well done.  The book took the tale classic tale, showing before and how Elphie became the ""wicked witch"". Elphie's tale makes you wonder was she really wicked and evil or just a girl who's life took turns giving people other ideas about her?
I can't wait to read the follow up books to the ""Wicked"" series but i bet they will be just as great as this one.

All and all wicked is just a great read and should defiantly be added to your collection."

This was a fantastic story! It is imaginative, creative, unique and beautifully written. This is narrated and seen through the eyes of a five year old boy, Jack. Imagine seeing the world from the perspective of a child, experiencing life for the first time, his innocent thoughts that adults could actually learn something from. Jack's mother had been kidnapped and placed inside a stifling small space, a bathroom, some basic cooking equipment, and a TV. Over a period of years, she gives birth to Jack, and he too is kept locked inside, so his view of ""the world"" is so limited, not even to have seen daylight. What imagination it had to have taken to create this realistic view of such horror and innocence. This is an experience to behold and nightmares maybe experienced long after."

124,Room,0316098337,Emma Donoghue,Barnes and Noble,4,Ree_Anderson,"Wow.  Really, just wow.  This book is, by far, my favorite read of 2010.  I admit that coming into it, I was skeptical.  SO much hype, so much buzz, so much chatter about how wonderful and fantastic and lovely this book is.could it really hold up to that? Could it deliver as promised?  Oh yes.yes it could. It does. It did. Room is -spectacular- on so many levels.

The story is told from the point of view of Jack, a 5 year old little boy who has never seen the world beyond that of the single room in which he and his mother live.  His world consists of that room, his Ma, and the fantasy land inside the television.  It's amazing how spot on the author was able to portray a curious, intelligent, and yet very socially handicapped young child.  His voice was so plaintive, so real, that it makes the reader want to reach into the pages and hug him close.

I could just go on and on about every tiny little thing that I absolutely loved about this book, but I still don't think that I could really do it justice.  The novel just packs such a huge emotional punch that you really have to read it yourself to experience the beauty of the author's story.  Read Room.  You will absolutely not regret it."

My only problem is why is the digital download version twice the price of the paperback edition?  You can go into any bookstore and buy this book for $8 for paperback and used bookstore can get it for $2 - $4, yet the digital download is $16.  I buy brand new bestsellers for less than that.  Don't know what the publisher is thinking here.  I know the price is set by the publisher and not B&N because they all are that way so not blaming B&N.  The publisher needs to learn something about the cost savings for digital downloads because there is no reason why the digital version should cost twice as much as the paperback version."

126,Dune (Dune Chronicles #1),0340839937,Frank Herbert,Barnes and Noble,4.6,¿¿¿¿¿,"Frank Herbert did not simply write a great science fiction novel; he created an entire universe of amazing detail that is filled with characters so well developed that they become real enough to be believed -- no matter how very different they are from our own selves.  Herbert laid a fabric of many plot lines, intrigues, and twists that the reader might become intractably enmeshed in the worlds of Dune eagerly and anxiously awaiting the next book in the series (as the Dune universe has been lovingly and skillfully continued by Frank's son Brian and his writing partner, Kevin J. Anderson).  When I first read Dune back in 1987 I was so strongly attracted that I finished it in a day and a half, and then immediately began reading the remaining four books of the then extant series inside of four days.  A rare thing for me.  

One should regard Dune as a master classic of scifi on par with any of the great scifi writers:  Asimov, Heinlein, etc."
127,The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference,0316346624,Malcolm Gladwell,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"The book is about the ""tipping point"", that is, that moment when an idea or social behaviour has reached a level where it ""tips"" and spreads like crazy. The book makes sense about how these things happen by using three rules- The Law of the Few, The Stickiness Factor, and the Power of Context. Taking three rules, then, the book uses them to explain seemingly puzzling epidemic situations in society such as teen smoking or bestsellers. Fun and interesting, if this kind of topic appeals to you, you'll like the book- its well written and an easy read. Other books that might appeal to general interest readers include The Sixty-Second Motivator"
127,The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference,0316346624,Malcolm Gladwell,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"Malcolm Gladwell, the author of The Tipping Point, explores the phenomenon known as the tipping point. According to Gladwell the tipping point is the moment at which ""an idea, trend, or social behavior crosses a treshold, tips, and spreads like wildfire"". In other words, the point when an idea, trend, or behavior becomes an sensation to the world. Gladwell researches the behaviors of fashion trends, crime rate, and best selling novels to explain how small, yet powerful changes can result in an tipping point.

Gladwell compares the idea of the tipping point to an epidemic of the flu. A simple sneeze from a sick person can start a flu epidemic just as a word of mouth can make an restaurant a big success. Gladwell seperates his book into the three rules of epidemics. The law of the few, the stickiness factor, and the power of context each explain how and why an idea, trend, or behavior results in an epidemic.

Gladwell uses examples such as Paul Revere's midnight ride to support his ideas on epidemics. Malcolm Gladwell states that ""Paul Revere's ride is perhaps the most famous historial example of a word-of-mouth epidemic"". Gladwell continues by calling Paul Revere a connector, a person who is truly socially diverse. Revere was able contact an abundant amount of people because he was connected with a large amount of diverse people. According to Gladwell, the message itself has to be sticky enough to make people listen and respond. The message ""the British are coming"" was a sticky phrase that made the message itself important enough to respond to. Malcolm Gladwell's context law states at the enviroment at which a message is sent also makes an impact. Paul Revere sent his message in the evening because the majority of people are sleeping and when they are woken up by a noise they are more susceptible to listen.

The Tipping Point is a brilliantly written book that will change your outlook on famous fashion trends, falling crime rates, and the success of best selling novels. Malcolm Gladwell uses interesting examples throughout to make his book an enjoyable read. By the end of this book Gladwell will make you believe that any immovable object can be tipped if it is pushed in the right place."

The examples talked about are really interesting like how Sesame Street came to be and what makes a sales person so successful. Gladwell uses examples to make his point fully comprehendible and interesting. He explains and analyzes studies of human behavior to conclude to several rules about the tipping point of products. It is a book worth reading! :D
128,Steve Jobs,1451648537,Walter Isaacson,Barnes and Noble,4.2,bulbrandt,"I bought this book after seeing a promotional interview with Walter Isaacson and this book. I didn't know much about Steve Jobs or Apple. I have not been an avid Apple products devotee. This is a wonderful book! I found it to be a compelling read and had a hard time putting it down. Mr. Isaacson is a really good writer and I now plan on reading his biography of Benjamin Franklin. I now know that Steve Jobs was a very interesting individual following his own head and heart. Isaacson writing is SMOOTH. It is succinct, but not boringly so, treating Job's sometimes not so great personality characteristics as honestly as he treated his very good traits and his genius. And apparently both Jobs and his wife wanted it that way which was very wise on their part. To do otherwise would have been a mockery of his life. If Isaacson had an agenda while writing this book or about Jobs it doesn't come out in the book. I felt no tug pulling me toward or against Jobs. This is one of those books that stays with you. Fascinating man! It made me feel that I/we may be missing out because of the mediocrity that is so prevalent in this country. There just are not a lot of Jobs's around, we discourage them. One thing I wish Isaacson had given us. Some sense of what it was like for Jobs to grow up in his rather conventional family without having his unconventional genius squashed. From what little was said they sound like they were suppportive, but I would like to hear some details. Can you imagine if some little boy like Jobs was in your child's elementary school? How many of these creative geniuses are molded into conformity? Excellent read - buy it!"
128,Steve Jobs,1451648537,Walter Isaacson,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Ahmed Raza,The only Steve Jobs biography which exposes Steve Jobs completely in terms of his work and personal philosophy. We finally know Steve as a mortal through this book.
128,Steve Jobs,1451648537,Walter Isaacson,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Kuasol1,"This is a very comprehensive book that details all aspects of Steve Jobs life and work bar one. Details about his formative years are sketchy. Walter Isaacson did not interview the one living person, adopted sister Patty Jobs, who could enlighten him more about interactions in the Jobs household that helped form Steve Jobs. Living relatives of Paul or Clara Jobs, his adoptive parents, were also not interviewed. Isaacson places more emphasis upon his biological parents. It seems that the literary works of Mona Simpson, Jobs biological sister, over influenced Isaacson. Even when there is a strong father figure in a home, mothers do help to form their children's personality. Clara Jobs gets no more than a few lines in a 600+ page book. Patty Jobs is mentioned only once or twice in passing. Research shows that she is still living and works at De Anza College in the payroll department, a position similar to that of her late mother. Hopefully a later biography will delve more thoroughly into Steve Jobs formative years."
129,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,0451163966,Ken Kesey,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Meagan_Traver,"The novel One Flew Over a Cuckoo¿s Nest is a dark, classic book that describes the journey of ex-prisoner Randle Patrick McMurphy and how he shakes up the life of a mental hospital after being sentenced as a patient himself. He claims to be insane but quickly shows his rebellious persona by challenging authority in the ward with his dramatic way to take over. The book maps his constant battle with the big nurse Ratched who is the overseeing power of the institution. Their combative ways is an eye-opening and compelling story line that shows the era of the 1960¿s was way different from today. The repetitive themes found in the book are standing up for one¿s self even if it is against a higher power and of course surviving the cruel, brain frying punishments executed in the disturbed ward. McMurphy is a brute and forceful man that has to push nurse Ratched¿s boundaries and break the rules to keep him from actually going crazy. I found myself riveted with the storyline and always wanting to turn the page to read what scheme McMurphy had dreamt up next to put into action. His interactions with the other patients was humorous and gave a clear picture of what life must have been like living with such twisted and physiologically disturbed people. McMurphy might not be considered the stereotyped ¿Hero¿ but is a timeless character who you want to see succeed nevertheless. Author Ken Kessey was not disillusioned into creating tragic endings. It is not a book for a younger audience or a feel good time. This book can measure up into being one of the greatest horror stories written and a perfect read during the Halloween season. If you enjoy this book as much as I did, I would recommend the following novels that give off the same eerie but page turning thrill; 1984 by George Orwell, Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, Go ask Alice by Anonymous, or 13 Reasons Why by Jay Asher. This book was an impeccable piece of writing with a shining 5 star quality. It is a longer read but the pages fly as the novel steadily peaks to the climax and shocking ending."
129,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,0451163966,Ken Kesey,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"For starters, I have this strange curiosity about psychology; coincidentally we were assigned outside ready in my English class and to my delight a Ken Kesey novel was on that list, One Flew Over the Cuckoo¿s Nest.  I went into the book without many expectations other than the fact that I was excited to read it, I fell in love.  Not only does Kesey refrain from shying away from saying something vulgar and true, he shines a light on what many don¿t want to see.  Based on semi-non-fictional experiences, Kesey offers a glimpse into a psychiatric ward in the late 1950s.  Many things are learned throughout the novel such as brutal ways patients were treated with, the head nurse exercising a totalitarian rule over the ward and that not all the patients are crazy rather they have tendencies that are different from the norm.  I really loved the novel and I highly recommend it as a ¿must read¿ because it touched topics that most people would not think of on a normal basis and really made you question the definition of insanity."

130,The Old Man and the Sea,0684830493,Ernest Hemingway,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"The Old Man and the SeaThe old man and The Sea by Ernest Hemingway, a story just over 100 pages in length is about an experienced Cuban fisherman in the Gulf and the giant Marlin he kills and loses. The fisherman, named Santiago, has gone over 2 months without catching any fish at all. On his 85th day at sea, his bait attracts a very large fish, which he believes to be a Marlin. He tries to reel the fish in but instead the fish drags his boat around and for two days the man struggles to keep his catch. On the third day, the Marlin finally stops dragging the boat and the old fisherman kills him. Santiago straps the fish to his boat and heads home. The trip home is not what Santiago desired and neither is the outcome but the way the story is told the ending is one that is not all bad. I e njoyed this story very much and it took me a very short time to finish, not because of the length, but also because of the content. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a good read that does not drag itself out whatsoever. This short novel is fierce, full of vibrant energy and humanity, all the while being a slave to the realities of finite power, of the inability to struggle against something greater than you. Of course, this is the standard ""man against nature"" story, but it is told so well that it rings true. This story won Hemingway the Nobel Prize and there is no doubt as to why. The simplicity of the story mixed with the complexity of the character development and the symbolism that is shown, defines what is necessary to create a successful work."
130,The Old Man and the Sea,0684830493,Ernest Hemingway,Barnes and Noble,3.9,NLKD,"Written in such detail, you can see every moment play out beautifully. I felt like I was sitting right there with the old man during his struggle. Very emotional connection to the character."
130,The Old Man and the Sea,0684830493,Ernest Hemingway,Barnes and Noble,3.9,deacon_blues,"It is fitting that this was the last book published by Hemingway in his lifetime: while he was still in his early fifties when wrote and published the novella to great success, the book works perfectly as the final work of a great writer and man, with reflections on life and the dignity of man at the twilight of his life. The prose is as precise and engaging as you can expect from Hemingway, in my opinion the great master of prose in the 20th century. This novella might be the perfect introduction to Hemingway to a novice reader of literature and I plan to read the story to my kids. I think it is beautiful, moving and is a great tale of perseverance, courage and humility in the figure of the heroic fisherman Santiago. The beautiful frienship between the old man and the boy is also touching as an example of gratitude and brotherly love. 

In short, you find the best of the human spirit in full display on this book - in most of his other books, Hemingway dwelled (with brilliance) on much darker sides of life (and death) but this one is a celebration of the best in all of us. The depiction of the natural world is breathtaking in its precision and energy and we know that Hemingway truly knew and loved the Gulf Stream and its creatures, big and small.

Much has been said about this book and I would like to comment on the specific edition: it has quite a few drawings illustrating the characters (including the awesome big fish!)and action on the book and it is a nice touch. For this, I highly recommend this edition of this short but rewarding masterpiece of a book."
131,The Grapes of Wrath,0142000663,John Steinbeck,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"The Grapes of Wrath, by John Steinbeck is an all time classic novel that depicts the reality of the Great Depression during the 1930's. The story first takes place in Oklahoma where the Dust Bowl had hit many crops and open fields where farmers farmed, children played, and had also hit the worst place to be hit-the lives of innocent people who lived day by day off their land. Because food and jobs were scarce, many families were forced to pack up what ever belongings they had left and move west. The main characters who take on the expedition of a new life are Tom, Ma, Pa, Jim, and Rose of Sharon. Each character has their own special quality's that they carry within that suffices the long and hard journey to California. While on the road the characters find not only how difficult it is to survive, but there are many things that have to be sacrificed in order for the majority to move on. Within the storyline you will find bumpy roads and battles that the characters must endure, thus so does every other book, however, this book will catch your attention very quickly because you will not only feel empathy for each and every character, as they struggle through the day, but you will be able to relive the hardships of the 1930's and think to yourself, ""Wow, this tragic event actually happened to ordinary people and they survived.""  John Steinbeck is an amazing author and has never let his readers down. You will be oh so very delighted to read this book and will not ever want to close it."
131,The Grapes of Wrath,0142000663,John Steinbeck,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Sarah_N_NC,"At times, I had to make myself plow through this one.  It was very depressing, made more so by the fact that things like what the Joads went through actually happened.  I'm 'anti-spoiler', so I won't give away the ending, but let me just say that the ending hit me hard.  It's as if the whole story came back to slap me in the face, making the power of it much stronger.  I'm glad I finished it."
131,The Grapes of Wrath,0142000663,John Steinbeck,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"As much a political manifesto as the simple story of a family forced to leave their family farm and seek a new life in California, the Grapes of Wrath is a masterpiece of American literature. Set in the American West at the start of the mass migration to the West Coast, the story follows the Joad family from the foreclosure of their farm through the long road trip along Route 66 and finally to their lives as migrant workers in a land overflowing with workers. Their lives and hardships are vividly painted in Steinbeck's outstanding prose.Steinbeck alternates styles in each chapter. Every other chapter details the story of the Joads. In the remaining chapters Steinbeck uses a repetitive, haphazard, ungrammatical, absolutely brilliant style to sketch a scene from the life of a migrant family, ostensibly the Joads. In these chapters, he conveys scenes such as the high-paced action of a used car lot, the bitterness of a family receiving foreclosure notice, or the back breaking work of cotton picking with such clarity and color that the words of the book seem to fall away leaving the reader with a tangible world in which voices are shouting or the breeze is tossing the cotton tufts into the air. In my own reading, I've seen many authors try to mimic this unstructured, repetitive style, but never done as well as this.The story is rich with symbolism and emotion. While there are some spots where Steinbeck seems to be working too hard, the book as a whole is a wonderful read. You will come away a little more educated about that era in America's history, a little more sympathetic to the plight of migrant workers, and maybe even a little more left-leaning in your political views. Regardless of what you intend to get out of it, the Grapes of Wrath is absolutely recommended for anyone of the maturity to understand the deep themes that run through the story. Highly recommended novel."
132,The Five People You Meet in Heaven,1401308589,Mitch Albom,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Taylor_Murphy,"The ""Five People You Meet in Heaven,"" by Mitch Albom, conveys a riveting story about a maintenance man, Eddie, who works at an amusement park known as Ruby Pier. Eddie feels trapped in a meaningless life filled with loneliness, sadness, and regret. Years go by, and, as the park changes, he does too. However, on his 83rd birthday he dies trying to save a little girl from an amusement ride malfunction, thus changing his mundane life forever. He finds himself in heaven, but it is not as he expected it to be. Eddie discovers that it is a place where your earthly life is explained to you through five people in heaven. Each of these five people was either a loved one or a distant stranger interconnected with Eddie, who at some point changed his life forever. One by one, Eddie's five people put his life into perspective and show him that his life was not as meaningless as he thought. Eddie finally realizes the importance of interconnection, sacrifice, forgiveness, love, and life. As the story unfolds, the book flashes back to Eddie's birthdays, giving the story purpose and readers a deep connection with Eddie and his past. As each person passes, Eddie desperately searches for the answer to his last action of redemption on earth: Did he save the little girl? I would recommend this book to anyone who is searching for a quick read with a meaningful and inspirational message about the significance of life. Once you open the book, you will have difficulty putting it down. You will find yourself wondering what is going to happen next. If you like this book, you will enjoy ""Tuesdays with Morrie,"" also by Mitch Albom."
132,The Five People You Meet in Heaven,1401308589,Mitch Albom,Barnes and Noble,4.3,rachel_a,"Some people may not believe in heaven, but in The Five People You Meet In Heaven, Eddie experiences a journey thourgh heaven. Mitch Albom's fiction novel is intersting and page turning; the suspense is agonzing. This novel teachers readers that the littlest things can affect a person's life. After Eddie worked at Ruby Pier for a majority of his life, Eddie never would have thought that he would die at the place where he mostly lived.
After Eddie died trying to save a little girl's life, he goes to heaven and has an unusual experience; Eddie meets five people that have affected him or vise versa. Each person takes him to a different place that is a part of his past. This book is a very original book that is not like any other book out there. It teaches valuable lessons such as everything happens for a reason and everyone makes some kind of sacrifice in their life.
In The Five People You Meet In Heaven, Eddie learns important lessons and meets very important people. This book wuold probably interest adults due to its mature nature; children younger than 13 may not fully understand the messages. This book is very memorable and lovely. The Five People You Meet In Heaven gives readers a new persective on life and the people in it."

I was at the bookstore one day and decided I would give it a try. I got home and read the first page. I then shut the book and set it on my bookshelf. It sat there and collected dust for about a year until I decided to start it agian. After I started it the second time, i couldn't set it down. I read the whole thing in about a week, just in class at school. I realized that this book had really given me a different outlook on life. That every decision I make has an impact on someone else's life, just as other people's decisions impact mine. I highly recommend this book to anyone, and everyone. It is very well written, and made me think in a totally new way."

133,"Anne of Green Gables (Anne of Green Gables, #1)",0451528824,L.M. Montgomery,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Amy Barlow,I read this as a child so I was excited to be able to download it for free. But due to all of the errors in translating to electronic format I was nit able to really enjoy it. I spent more time trying to figure out what words were supposed to be there than just relaxing and enjoying the story. I will have to get a hard copy from my library. Too bad the electronic copy was not reviwed prior to publishing as many people will probably get frustrated before the story is done and move on to something else. Regardless of the errors I love this story and look forward to getting it from my local library as i suggest anyone interested in reading this story to do.

But I wasn't too concerned until I started listening to it.  Being a die hard Anne of Green Gables fan I was extremely disappointed that their idea of shortening the story was to completely cut out key events and rewrite new contrived events that fall flat and do not lend themselves to the dramatic, touching, sometimes comical life of Anne Shirley.  That coupled with the squeaky mouse-like voice that the narrator uses for Anne, and I will be searching for a new audio book for Anne of Green Gables to replace this one. This is NOT Lucy Maude Montgomery's Anne of Green Gables...fans be forewarned!"

Full of magic, demons (definitely lots of those), action, and ""forbidden"" (read the book and you'll know why that's in quotes...)romance. Oh, and there's also the forbidden (without quotes) romance...but that's a whole other story WORTH READING)

 The characters are so well developed that it seems as though you've known them your whole life. Before you know it, you'll realize that Jace and Clary have snuck (or sneeked--whichever you prefer) their way into your heart.

Completely unforgettable, thoroughly captivating, and utterly sexy. Read it."
134,"City of Glass (The Mortal Instruments, #3)",1416914307,Cassandra Clare,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Marcy_Jo,"It's a scary thing when you get to the final book in a series ortrilogy that you particularly care about. There's a certain amount ofapprehension involved,correlating directly to your emotionalinvolvement to the story and characters. Its tricky for the author towrap things up in a way that is true to the characters,  consistentwith the themes of the previous books, ties up the story arcs, and is still enjoyable to read. I've never read the final book in any series that managed to seamlessly do all of those things.City of Glass did.The characters remained true to themselves while still managing to grow appropriately.Clary was very Clary-ish. Particularly early on in the book she wasjust as rash and independent and headstrong as ever. Watching hercharacter progression over the span of the book (as well as theseries), I must say that she usurps Gemma Doyle for the crown offemale protagonists in the category that I refer to as ""Girls Who DoThings."" And she does ""Do Things."" Regardless of the fact that Jacetried to keep her from Idris, despite the fact thatshe lacks the training or even the in depth knowledge of theirsociety, Clary refuses to sit on the sidelines. She refuses to berelegated to the role of bystander or victim. She was very true to thecharacter that we got to know in City of Bones and City of Ashes.Jace, well, what can I say. Jace's journey here is epic. As he has inevery book before, he broke my heart. Watching him struggle withhimself, with his past, with things he cannot control...it isbeautiful.The 'minor' characters (though I am loathe to call them that, seeinghow real and well developed they are) really shine here, too. They all grow to meet the challenges before them, and we see a different side of*everyone* in Idris, though they stay true to the characters we knew.To say that I am ecstatic about the character development here is agross understatement.All of the story arcs--both for the individual characters as well asthe main conflicts--are tied up nicely. The foundations for everythingthat happens have been building since COB. The resolutions are notgratuitous or indulgent. They feel as if--rather than the writergiving the series the ending she wanted it to have, regardless ofwhether or not it fit the themes of the other books--the authorallowed these characters to tell their stories through her. It was theway endings should be...but so rarely ever are.I laughed, I cried, I squealed, I shouted at the characters, I yelled ""Yes!"" and ""No!""Oftentimes I did all of those things within the span of a single chapter. It's an emotional whirlwind reading experience. I wasphysically unable to put the book down from the moment I picked it up. And the ending?  Well, the ending left me breathless.I don't say this lightly: there are probably two dozen books that Ieasily list as ""one of my favorite books of all time."" City of Glass is not on that list. City of Glass *IS* my favorite book of all time. For sheer emotional connect, suspense, excitement, character WIN,romance, frighteningly believable villainy goodness, and moments that made me flail around like a toddler in the candy closet, it isunparalleled. So for those of you eagerly counting down the days between now andMarch 24, take heart. City of Glass is well worth the wait. I hadreally high expecta"
135,"A Storm of Swords (A Song of Ice and Fire, #3)",055357342X,George R.R. Martin,Barnes and Noble,4.6,JGolomb,"I'm almost out of breath after completing George RR Martin's ""Storm of Swords"", the third in his Fire and Ice series. Each chapter is like its own short story with its own little cliffhanger. Martin's characters are dramatic, melodramatic, genuine, realistic, and so bold and colorfully drawn that I find myself thinking about them in between readings. After each book I've needed to take a little breather, but find myself drawn back to the stories and the characters' individual and interconnected dramas, desperate to find out what's happened next, while enjoying the immersion in Martin's world.

While some of Martin's characters are clear 'black hats', and some are 'white'...there's more 'gray' than anything else, which adds to the realism of the ever-changing qualities that the characters display. Some of the black hats start moving toward white, and some of the white drift towards the black. Like real life, few of Martin's story lines have true endings. Even when a character is killed, the ramifications are often far reaching and impact Martin's landscape across multiple books in the series. 

One couldn't really get their arms around 'Storm of Swords' without having the background of the previous two books. The author doesn't pander to one looking for detailed background and reminders. He relies on the memories of the reader to connect the dots until Martin's good and ready to connect them outright.

This is the first book in the series that really takes a full leap into fantasy, whereas the first two were more medieval historical novels set in an otherworldly location. Martin introduces some of the evil that's been threatening from the north - Giants, Mammoths, Shadowcats, and the living dead. There's a sprinkle of magic from Melisandre and her Lord of the Light. And oh yeah, and the three dragons with their mother Daenerys, are threatening Westeros from the East.

What drives this series are the characters and storylines. And there are a lot of each. Martin chews through pages like a direwolf through a deer, but things are never dull, and the storylines never dry up. The final 300+ pages absolutely fly by. I'm not a fantasy reader. But I love this series. And book three is as solid, deep and satisfying as the previous two."
135,"A Storm of Swords (A Song of Ice and Fire, #3)",055357342X,George R.R. Martin,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Guest,"Luckily for me, I came into the series really late, as in just this past summer.  When my boyfriend dumped me, my sister practically shoved A Game of Thrones in my hand as a balm to get me over the worst of it.  Better than drugs, more addictive than crack, I seriously couldn't put the book down.  I let my dad drive my truck back from  Atlanta just so I could continue reading it.    Wonderfully intricate politics, characters that you can't decide to hate or love, lush settings, and, through it all, a master story teller plies his trade with expertise.  You spend half your time wondering whether or not you should hate someone, never to be given a definate yes or no in most cases, strangely like real life here.  The two characters I have been steadfast in my regard for are Arya and Sansha.  Arya simply because she is a Stark and she is, by god, going to DO something about this mess (and I love strong tomboy characters).  I loathe Sansha as strongly as I love Arya...anyone who gives up their wolf and turns their back on their family gets what they deserve...but I do feel sorry for her.  She got caught in a web of her own making...but no one really deserves Jeoffrey.    Love these books and I have made most of my friends read the series as well.  We are now waiting anxiously for the new one even as we continue to argue the old ones."

Although she's become successful on the outside, the inside still trembles at the damage inflicted by her mother Vivi while growing up.
In an attempt to help her daughter understand - and possibly restore their terribly damaged relationship - Vivi sends Sidda a scrapbook filled with ""Ya-Ya-rabilia."" As Sidda flips through the book and examines each item, the voices of Vivi and the other Ya-Yas explain the context which the item represents. Quickly, Sidda realizes that her mother was once young and full of hopes, which were dashed by her dour parents and a tragic death.

Well, before I read any book series I HAVE to get most of them before I start to read any of them and I hate to read novels out of sequence.Outlander was a delight! My friends were RIGHT! It WAS good and I did like it! I too fell in love with Jamie. In fact I felt sorry for the bloke! What he went through!! I cried for him, hurt for him, was enraged with everything he went through, right along with the heroine. I wanted to pummel Captain Randell so many times, even wanted to smack Jamie a couple of times for being so stubborn!Gabaldon not only brought the characters to life but the time period as well. I really felt I was in Jacobite Scotland. She is an extraordinary storyteller. The book was suspenseful and filled with intrique as well as with romance. I'd still like to know who hit Jamie on the back of the head. She never really explained that. Several characters where suspected, but none admitted to it.While slow in places, especially when the heroine was talking about the historical aspects of the time period or something that had to do with healing, the book had a nice pace and did keep me interested until the end. In fact when I reached the end I wanted MORE! Thank goodness there IS a second book! I have begun Dragonfly in Amber and already it has me intrigued and in tears!"

Be warned, you won't get anything else done while reading it. Now, I wouldn't go around calling it academic literature or anything, but as an escapist novel, it is divine. I hate romance fussy stuff, *never* read romance novels, and I adored this book. Yet it is about a love story, and it has plenty of 'adult fun time' described in it to support the romantic relationship the two main characters have to each other. So a romance novel it is I suppose. And yet one that is well written, tight, with great plot control and well developed characters; tense thrills and wonderfully researched history. It is one of the rare novels in which, after putting it aside for a few days, I still have to remind myself that the characters are not real and I am not, in fact, living in 18th century Scotland and my husband will laugh at me if I talk with a brogue. It's so incredibly engaging! I enjoyed every minute of this work. I highly recommend it."

138,The Scarlet Letter,0142437263,"Nathaniel Hawthorne, Thomas E.

If you've been married, betrayed, or have children- it's a totally different read from when your only worry is breaking curfew and going to the mall."
138,The Scarlet Letter,0142437263,"Nathaniel Hawthorne, Thomas E. Connolly, Nina Baym",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Anonymous,"The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne is one of the most well known pieces of literature, and it definitely deserves its title as an American classic. Set in a puritan colony in Massachusetts, the book depicts the life a young woman named Hester Prynne as she commits the ignominious crime of adultery. However, not only does she commit this sin with just anybody, her partner in crime turns out to be the town&rsquo;s church minister. Then on top of this, Hester conceives a child she names Pearl. With the scarlet letter of shame she is now forced to where upon her breast, and with the child that was a direct result of her crime, she becomes the towns&rsquo; outcast. These elaborate conflicts carry on throughout the plot as Hester struggles to prevail over her disgrace and to keep incognito her fellow sinner. The third person narrative focuses on the development of Hester as she gains independence, and strives to achieve forgiveness and a normalcy back into her life. She starts work as a weaver in order to provide for Pearl, and help give back to the community. The piece also concentrates on Pearl, how she is the representation of a devil child, and her fascination and constant attraction to Hester&rsquo;s scarlet letter. In addition, although Hester loves her with all her heart, she did not like the way Pearl was conceived. Pearl, along with her mother, is an outcast but develops into a strong, multifaceted child who in some minds, even sometimes in Hester&rsquo;s, is evil. Pearl&rsquo;s father is also developed in the story, as he deals with extreme guilt. He is driven almost insane with the knowledge that he should be sharing the same fate as Hester. Hawthorne writes in a way so well thought out, that the reader can feel many different emotions and conjure so many different opinions. Hawthorne pinpoints the themes of evil, sin, and the identity in society throughout the novel, really highlighting a psychological, as well as sociological, way of writing. He depicts these difficult subjects in such intricate ways through the different characters in his story. For example, the scarlet letter A helped Hester daringly analyze herself and her position in society, further letting her accept the awful she has committed. Arthur Dimmesdale on the other hand&mdash;Pearl&rsquo;s father&mdash;had the internal burden of keeping his adultery a secret, thus displaying an alternative view and perhaps even a worse off way, to cope with his wrongdoing. Nevertheless, this is only one of the numerous interpretations of the different themes in the book, solidifying that the novel really does have a great deal of complexity. Although the novel is a fantastic classic, it does like anything else have a few weaknesses; some including the loquacious tone Hawthorne turns to when describing in depth different settings, people, and events. The narration during this lags on for a bit before it gets back into more interesting events. In addition, it is a classic, and the writing is obviously written with a different mannerism, which can be taken as a pain to read, or a very poetic technique. Even so, the Scarlet Letter&rsquo;s benefits outweigh its flaws. The captivating plot, interesting characters, and complex themes keep the attention of the reader and make them want to keep reading to find out what will happen next. That is why the Scarlet Letter is a classic, and that is why it will be read for many more generations to come."
138,The Scarlet Letter,0142437263,"Nathaniel Hawthorne, Thomas E. Connolly, Nina Baym",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Vovo,"I moaned, groaned, and complained about reading The Scarlet Letter for a literature class, but as I turned the first page, my attention was seduced. The writing itself is very unique in its style. Mostly, the chapters critically analyze the characters therin, delving into the abyss of thought. As well as displaying a fantastic portrayal of Puritan society, the symbols, the emotions, and the dialogue are masterful. The Scarlet Letter is well-wriiten, thought-provoking, and definitly a book that should continue to be read."

The story is based on a collection of vintage photographs. The pictures are scattered throughout the book and make it more of a multimedia experience.

Initially was going to purchase this book for a road trip, to read with my 9 year old.  BUT, after reading the sample for the Nook Color, (thank you bunches, B&N!) realized two things: 1) this is NOT something I feel age appropriate for a 9 year old (the critics were right on for 12+), and 2)immediately, knew it is absolutely perfect for me.  I could not purchase ""Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children"" fast enough as the sample hooked me quickly, and left me wanting more of the adventure!!  

I could not put this down (read every moment I could, including ignoring house hold chores) and am now looking forward to the next book I believe is intended, in the series.

The author takes us through many harrowing and suspenseful moments, even a laugh out loud event and then in the end neatly ties together the future of our main characters. At many points in her life Lisbeth Salander appeared to be controlled by others however we can see she is very much in control and ready to fight back. Along with Lisbeth and Mikael Blomkvist, Erika Berger Millennium's editor and Mikael's sometime lover is the focus of much attention. For me Lisbeth our quirky and ORIGINAL heroine ranks up there with Martin Cruz Smiths Arkady Renko, Len Deighton's Bernard Samsom and Ian Rankin's John Rebus. The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets' Nest has Internet hackers who are heros and doctors who are villains, the book has it all. Trying very hard to read the book slowly and to savor it for as long as I could the plan yesterday was to read about 50 pages or so. Starting at about page 200 and then suddenly a few wonderfully enjoyable hours later page 601. Finished, done, happy but sad that it was over and there would be no more books from steig Larsson."

Of the much enjoyed trilogy, this book was the most difficult to put down. The complex plot development was so well put together that that the many characters involved, though many just briefly, were easily remembered. 

I don't feel that it would be fair to readers to share any of the content of the book. Rather, if you enjoyed the first two books this one will not disappoint. This book, as well as its predecessors, I will be recommending for many years."

141,The Martian,0804139024,Andy Weir,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Karen_Benson,"First, a big thank you to NetGalley for sending me an eARC of this book.

The Martian is described as Apollo 13 meets Castaway. 

I had the honor of meeting Astronaut Jim Lovell, have a signed copy of his book about the Apollo 13 mission (which I've read 3 times) and I loved Castaway! 

And... One of my mild obsessions is Mars! I want to go to Mars. I talk to my grandkids about how they need to be astronauts when they grow up so THEY can go to Mars. 

When I read the description of The Martian, the science geek in me that loves reading and/or watching everything I can about the Apollo program,and who loves Mars... well, you can say I got just a tad bit excited. Alright, maybe more than a tad bit.

And then I settled in to read. Wow!! Amazing, amazing read. It's completely believable and in my mind I was right there with Mark Watney as he solved one disastrous problem after another after another. This book was written so I was never bored with the science whatsoever, even though a lot of it was way over my head. Astronaut Mark Watney is a cheeky, oftentimes, hilarious botanist/engineer with a lot of McGuyver ingenuity. I seriously had a hard time putting this book down and even though it's been several days, I still cannot stop thinking about this book.

Author Andy Weir has really crafted a well thought out, exciting thriller of a story which includes all the science of NASA and space travel. I couldn't get enough and sure hope he continues writing in this genre. I will definately be first in line to pick up his future books!! Well done, Mr. Weir!"

Once the church burns to the ground, Kingsbridge becomes the unlikely stage for power struggles between church and state, the church's internal battles, and a civil war to determine England's new monarch. The lives of the characters buoy helplessly upon the waves of these sweeping changes and conflicts, each one overcome with their own quests for survival. At the crux of it all is each character's desire either to build, or to frustrate the building of the Kingsbridge Cathedral. Follett's stuns his readers with what the characters are willing to do, to endure and to overcome in their race to manifest their own relentless ambitions, at any cost."

A mystery set in the MacCarthy era should not only entertain but provide information as to what MacCathyism was all about.  In the development of the characters and the events they endured, Ken Follett educates the reader in the life and times of this remote era.  Reveals the primitive nature of life during this time and the legal and social atmosphere that pervaded in Western Europe during the twelfth century.  For those interested, cathedral architecture is addressed and the influence of the church is portrayed.  Although the circumstances and events depicted as having occurred to the characters is sometimes a bit ludicrous, one can easily relate to their angst at times and joy at others.  Their emotions are believable and, as in most other well written fiction, leave one with a sense of loss as the era ends."

Set in WW II Germany and France with forays into the Soviet Union, it tells the parallel journeys of Marie Laure, a blind German girl, and Werner Pfennig, a German orphan. Werner&rsquo;s gift with electronics attracts the attention of Nazi military technicians who drag him into the Hitler Youth and, eventually, into the war where he is responsible for determining the coordinates of enemy resistance fighters using hidden radios. Marie Laure is the beloved daughter of the French National Museum locksmith. He flees Paris with his daughter when the Germans invade, going to stay with his housebound uncle, Etienne, in St. Malo. 

The book begins when the child Werner and Etienne&rsquo;s paths cross over the radio waves. Etienne brother had recorded ten children&rsquo;s radio shows and Etienne played them over the wireless radio. Werner and his sister listened to them faithfully sparking Werner&rsquo;s interest in science and electronics. Interestingly, the book ends when the soldier Werner&rsquo;s path crosses with Marie Laure. He hears Marie Laure reading a book over the same wireless while requesting help between sentences and goes to her aid instead of reporting her. Between these two events, Doerr shows the paths followed by the two children and how their personal characteristics determine the wartime choices they make. Part of the story includes the search for an ancient diamond rumored to bring death to those closest to the person who owns it. Marie Laure is at the crux of this portion of the story. She must decide whether to hold on to the stone or get rid of it. The question in her mind is whether the rumors are true and can she affect whether the stone&rsquo;s power will prevail.

	Some readers may be confused by Doerr&rsquo;s use of parallel stories while moving back and forth in time, however, if readers pay attention to the time lines at the beginning of each chapter, they should not have difficulty keeping up with the story. All the Light We Cannot See examines the roads ordinary people take to protect themselves when faced with circumstances beyond their control."
144,"Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption",1400064163,Laura Hillenbrand,Barnes and Noble,4.3,nancymitchell,"I couldn't tear myself away from this long book once I started! Louis Zamperini was an average little boy until he became a teenager. It was then that he learned to run. He went to the Berlin Olympics to represent the USA. But this isn't what this book is about. It's raw, exciting and gripping, about salvation, survival, fighting inner and outer demons, suffering horrific pain. The trouble began when he was called into service, like so many young American men, to fight the Japanese. His greatest feat was his survival of an Air force plane crash in the Pacific during WWII, then somehow surviving being a prisoner of war, the torture, starvation, beatings. As painful as it was to read the POW camp accounts, the remarkable, miraculous thing is that Zamperini and the others managed to persevere and survive. The book continued after this horrific experience to detail the after effects fighting the inner demons to get back to a place of peace. This is an excellent story, an excellent account, excellent writing and an excellent lesson. I big time recommend!"
144,"Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption",1400064163,Laura Hillenbrand,Barnes and Noble,4.3,norway_girl,"I have just finished an advanced copy of Unbroken, the true story of Louis Zamperini and realized I have read the next New York Times Bestseller and looked up to see if it had already been optioned for a movie, because that is what I saw when I was reading it; an Oscar Award film playing from the pages of an incredible but absolutely true story. Ms. Hillenbrand is the award winning, #1 New York times Bestselling Author of Seabiscuit and it took seven years to research and write this book. The cover sheet in the advance reader copy a publishing executive writes to readers that she is humbled to write about this book, the author and its subject. I was certainly humbled to read it. Ms. Hillenbrand very successfully brings Louie's life, from his mischievous childhood, through his Olympic experiences, and the extremes of his military service to the reader with such detail as to be physically palpable. My father served in the Navy in the Pacific and I have always been partial to the history of that theater of World War II so I was drawn by the book jacket to read this. Being from the East coast, I had not heard of Mr. Zamperini, so I have completely consumed by this incredible journey of a book and the life of the man. It carried me through every emotion and I found myself laughing out loud, reaching for tissues, and holding my breath in suspense. Sometimes I was afraid to turn a page and then at the same time afraid not to. From cover to cover, I could not put it down. As we have just past the 65th anniversary of the end of World War II and come close to the end of 2010 with Veterans Day, I would like to thank Mr. Zamperini for his service and sacrifice (along with my father and those who suffered and gave their lives for our country) and sincere and heartfelt appreciation to Laura Hillenbrand for bringing his story to all and especially to those of us descended from the greatest generation. Don't miss this book. Seabiscuit was a wonderful book. This one is even better !"
144,"Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption",1400064163,Laura Hillenbrand,Barnes and Noble,4.3,NovelChatter,"On June 23, 1943 three American soldiers had been drifting in the Pacific Ocean for twenty seven days. The rafts were deteriorating, their bodies were covered in salt sores, and they didn't know it at the time, but there would be another twenty days of drifting ahead for them. Only two of the three would survive.  One of them was former Olympic runner Louis Zamperini whose life would never be the same. 


Laura Hillenbrand's Unbroken is an amazing study in resilience, defiance and strength that takes you on the journey of one man's lifetime. Zamperini was an incorrigible child, a natural runner, and a man who would not be broken. He survived unspeakable torture and deprivation at the hands of his Japanese captors only to find himself being tortured by his memories after returning home at the end of the war. 


Being over taken with the reoccurring tortures that resided in his mind, Zamperini turned to alcohol. He reclaimed his life after hearing an inspiring speaker in a tent on a street corner in Los Angeles. That speaker was Billy Graham.  Graham taught him about total forgiveness. It was then and there that Louie was able to release the hatred and take hold of his own life and destiny.


Laura Hillenbrand, author of Seabiscuit, brought the story of depression era wonder horse to us all. Now she brings us the story of Louis Zamperini, who as of this writing is ninety-three years old and residing in Los Angeles.  Hillenbrand said that she came across an article about Louis Zamperini while doing research for Seabiscuit and set it aside.  I'm glad she went back to Zamperini's story. In one of her countless interviews with Mr. Zamperini spanning seven years, he assured Hillenbrand that ""I'll be an easier subject than Seabiscuit, because I can talk.""   Although Unbroken is over 450 pages in length, but there's never a dull or lagging moment, just the opposite. The story flows quickly and the suspense keeps you turning the pages.  


Zamperini's struggle to reclaim his life is beautifully told by Hillenbrand. In Unbroken, Hillenbrand captures the spark of a man determined to survive what he had to and to come out the winner he'd always been.


I received this book as an advance readers copy upon  my request to the publisher. I like it so much, I'll be at the brick and mortar book store Tuesday to buy a copy to add to my own library."
145,Deception Point,0671027387,Dan Brown,Barnes and Noble,4.1,yoyokro,"This book is simply wonderful, and I would even venture to say it is Brown's best work so far.  A thrilling tale that takes the reader on an intellectual adventure."
145,Deception Point,0671027387,Dan Brown,Barnes and Noble,4.1,ReederJR,"The plot involves Rachel Sexton, an employee for the National Reconnaissance Office, who is called upon by the President to help with a new discovery. Along with several civic scientists, Rachel travels to the Arctic. The new discovery is of a meteorite discovered by NASA in the Arctic ice. While in the Arctic, Rachel and her new companions notice some curious details, which could ultimately lead to a political disaster for the President. Before she can contact the President, assassins attack Rachel and her companions. While fleeing for their lives, Rachel and her companions discover who is behind the plot to fool the country. Sexton maintains his own agenda during this process, deceiving even those who are close to him. This book really pulls the reader into the story, providing the reader with a quick and easy book to read. I had a tough time putting the book down, and loved the blend of fact and fiction that Brown included throughout the entire novel. This book is suited for anyone with some free time looking to read a quality book with some unexpected plot twists."

146,The Goldfinch,0316055433,Donna Tartt,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Humbee,"Any book of Donna Tartt's is like a miracle of reading.  She is the closest thing to reading a Dickens sort of novel today with its density of characters and storyline, mysteries and details of the most minute and miracles of writing.  To read one of her books is to experience a travel that's like no other. Reading &quot;The Goldfinch&quot; is like that.  It's her best effort thus far, I think.  It's simply the most amazing.  And, that doesn't mean I don't think you should read her other two books!

 

 

I found myself jumping up several times in glee and forcing my husband just to listen to small descriptions of the otherwise mundane in this novel.  She writes so beautifully that the union suit of a miner hanging on a bathroom shower curtain becomes iconic and gorgeous!  It actually is so real, it lives and breathes!!  Amazing stuff...so you can imagine how the rest of her story comes to life.  The repair and care of antique furniture becomes so precious and such an act of love, it reaches your soul.

 

 

Tartt's characters are to love, hate, to sympathize with, to disparage, to want to reach out for.  They are pitiful, disgusting, harmful, harmless and worthy of your most tender feelings.  She runs the gamut.  You become fully engaged...it's impossible not to.  They are so alive.

 

This is a story about relationships of all kinds: parenting, friendship, love.  There's fear and selfishness and other emotions from basic relationships.  It's a story of redemption and finding ones place in the world.  It's an exploration of the world from many sides of life.

 

I will admit there is so much to take in in this novel that I couldn't just sit down and read it fast like some books.  I had to take it in parcels.  I wanted to savor the words and the journey of its characters, particularly the primary one, Theo.   I've always felt that way about Tartt's books.  They are the kind you don't want to finish quickly because when you do, they'll be all gone!  I hate to turn the last page.

 

I would welcome you on this journey of a special read.  It's unusual.  It's one that will charm you and touch your heart.  It will cause you to stop and smile, laugh, cry out in surprise, feel hurt and even offended for the characters.  I'd be very surprised if you don't love it as much as I have.

 

Donna Tartt is a genius author of our times.  Not to read her is like not reading Joyce Carol Oates."
146,The Goldfinch,0316055433,Donna Tartt,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Anonymous,"I usually don't write reviews, but the greatness of this book demands it.
It is filled with utter beauty. I did not want this book to end.  You would be missing a great work of art by not reading THE GOLDFINCH."
146,The Goldfinch,0316055433,Donna Tartt,Barnes and Noble,3.5,Anonymous,"I've purchase 174 books since buying my NOOK.  Thi is the first time I've felt compelled to add a comment about one of my purchases.

If &ldquo;brevity is the soul of wit,&rdquo; as Shakespeare wrote, then Donna Tartt is unfamiliar with the concept.  At times, it was excruciating to slog through this drivel; I stopped reading it three times out of sheer frustration and boredom.  While certainly well written, the book is at least 300 pages too long.  It reminded me of a person in love with their own speaking voice. Noteworthy only for its banal details and the unlikeable main character, I can not recommend this book."

147,Thirteen Reasons Why,1595141715,Jay Asher,Barnes and Noble,4.4,pagese,"This book caught my interest from the first time I saw it.  I finally picked it up when I saw it at the library.  Within the first couple pages I was hooked.  They way the author presented this story was so real.  I could feel Clay's emotions as he listened to each of the tapes.  I wanted to reach out to Hannah and tell her that everything was going to be okay.   I've read reviews that state they felt Hannah was placing blame on those 13 people.  I never felt like that through the entire story.  I felt Hannah was trying to point out that a person's actions DO affect others.  Rumors, lies, bullying, etc are all ways that can cut a person down.  I think Hannah hoped that through the tapes, she could make someone (even just one) realize their behavior can change.  I was so raw in emotion towards the end, I needed to step back from the book for awhile and reflect over it.  You know the outcome of the story, but part of you hopes for that glimmer of help.  Something for Hannah to reach out and hold on to.  I hope this book becomes a must read for teens.  I think it has a very real portrayal of suicide and that things that may drive a person to believe that it may be the only option."
147,Thirteen Reasons Why,1595141715,Jay Asher,Barnes and Noble,4.4,TeensReadToo,"I don't often write introductions to my reviews. In fact, the last time I can remember doing so was with the wonderful PUCKER by Melanie Gideon, which I read in 2006. However, THIRTEEN REASONS WHY, the debut novel from author Jay Asher, is the type of book that begs an introduction. So if you'd like to skip down to the third paragraph for the ""meat"" of the story, I won't hold it against you -- but you'll be missing something important. If you have the chance to only read one novel this year, THIRTEEN REASONS WHY should be that book. It's sad, amazing, heartbreaking, and hopeful, all at the same time. I dare you to read it and not become so immersed in the story that you lose track of time and your surroundings. You'll cry, several times, while reading this story. You'll have no choice but to think about your actions, and wonder what type of effect they have on other people. And, in the end, you might also find the need to say ""thank you."" Now, on to the story... When Clay Jensen finds a package on his front porch, he's excited. A package, for him? With no return address? What could it possibly be? What Clay finds is a shoebox full of cassette tapes, each marked as ""Cassette 1: Side A,"" ""Cassette 1: Side B,"" etc. Of course he rushes to the old radio/cassette player in his dad's garage to check out these mysterious tapes. And soon wishes, wholeheartedly, that he'd never picked up that stupid package from his front porch. What he hears when he inserts that first tape is the voice of Hannah Baker. Hannah, the girl he'd crushed on for longer than he could remember. The girl he went to school with. The girl he worked at the movie theater with. The girl who had changed, drastically, in the last several months. Hannah Baker, the girl who committed suicide. Clay soon realizes that these tapes aren't just a suicide note, aren't, really, even a clear-cut rendition of why she did what she did. Instead, these are thirteen reasons -- thirteen people, to be exact -- who created a snowball-effect of events that led Hannah to believe that suicide was her only option. But why is Clay on that list? How could he possibly be one of the reasons that she killed herself? As the day goes on, Clay becomes obsessed with listening to the tapes. And what he hears frightens him, disturbs him, and, in the end, leads him to realizations that he never would have expected. As Clay listens to the role that thirteen people, including himself, led in the ultimate death of Hannah Baker, his view of the world, and himself, changes drastically. You will love this book, because you won't be able to help yourself. You will feel what Clay feels. You will, in a very strong way, experience the highs and lows of Hannah's life right along with her. And there is nothing, in my opinion, that could speak better for the authenticity of a book. Read THIRTEEN REASONS WHY. And then, if you're like me, you'll read it again. And, hopefully, none of us will ever forget it."
148,Girl with a Pearl Earring,0452287022,Tracy Chevalier,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"I actually watched the film first and I liked it, so I decided to give the book a chance and loved it!  This is Holland in the 17th century where a young girl named Griet is forced to work at the house of Vermeer.  She tells the story in first person.  I felt her pain having to leave home at such a young age.  Women did not have many options during that era, either give in to men or be cast out, which Griet battled with.  So many times I thought her and Vermeer would make a love connection, and Chevalier definitely added that romantic stress to the plot.  As for the painting, the pearl earring was Vermeer's wife's possession and she was quite the vindictive lady, which unfortunately, Griet had to deal with the wrath of her jealousy."
148,Girl with a Pearl Earring,0452287022,Tracy Chevalier,Barnes and Noble,4.3,LostInMyBook,I thought this book was really good it was very easy to read and the story had a great plot. I thought this book was a lot better than the movie. I would recommend this book to anybody who wants to read a great book.
148,Girl with a Pearl Earring,0452287022,Tracy Chevalier,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Fiction_Fanatic,"Wonderful book, simply written, easy to read yet allows the reader to imagine each scene and event.  Great plot that explores who could be the subject of Vermeer's painting.  This book looks into what a young girl might think and feel back then and easily relates to readers of the present day."
149,"If I Stay (If I Stay, #1)",0525421033,Gayle Forman,Barnes and Noble,4.2,TeensReadToo,"Mia has a lot to love in life. She is a cellist who could be on her way to Julliard. She has a wonderful, loving, and supportive family. And she has a boyfriend who is perfect. But as wonderful as Mia's life is, she has choices to make. Should she go to Julliard and leave everyone behind?

When a terrible accident occurs, Mia suddenly finds herself with only one choice left - should she stay?

This book is just WOW! Do not read this in public because this one will bring tears to your eyes - I'm warning you! That doesn't mean it doesn't have humor though, because there were many times I found myself laughing out loud. This is an intense story that will not only appeal to teens, but have a lot of crossover adult appeal, as well.

Gayle Forman does an excellent job going from Mia's present to Mia's past and drawing the reader in so they truly understand her love for the cello, her family, and Adam, her boyfriend. As I was reading, I felt like I really got to know Mia and her family and found myself grieving along with Mia - the writing is just that powerful.

IF I STAY is a short read, but it packs so much in and I wanted to savor every moment. At times I found myself reading slower and drinking in the words because I didn't want the story to end.

The story centers around music: Mia with her cello, Adam with his band, and Mia's dad being a drummer, and Gayle Forman's writing felt lyrical. She was able to capture music and put it into a book. I don't know how to describe it, but it was like I was reading a song - hopefully that makes sense! Music is such an important part of the book, Gayle Forman has included a playlist for the book on her website. I loved checking out the songs that went along with the story and listening to them when Mia did.

IF I STAY is a must-read. The themes of love, loss, grief, and hope are so powerful and beautifully written that this story will stay with you long after you finish the last page."
149,"If I Stay (If I Stay, #1)",0525421033,Gayle Forman,Barnes and Noble,4.2,BookLoverMV,"All I can say is WOW. I finished this book at 2 AM this morning and I'm still thinking about how much it moved me. I cried several times and just fell in love with Mia and all those who surrounded her, ""her family"". It's a truly touching and a wonderful story, when I finished I was left wanting to know more about her families past adventures. And how Forman describes the families love of music drives you to want to pick up an instrument and learn to play. I enjoy all types of music and can't wait to check out Yo-Yo-Ma, aka ""Yo Mama"" per Adam. This is a great read and you will not be disappointed."

150,The Red Tent,0312353766,Anita Diamant,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Awesomeness1,"This novel follows the tale of Dinah, the daughter of Jacob barely mentioned in the Old Testament. In the Hebrew Bible, she is seen as a young girl who a handsome prince took advantage of, and that the following slaughter was the result of her family defending her honor. 

I went into this book solely expecting a rich, entertaining story and that's what I got. I never read the story in the Bible, so I didn't have any expectations in regard to being accurate. 

I learned much from this book and I could picture the vivid scenery. The way it was written was just so beautiful. Scenes that I would have otherwise found awkward were handled tenderly with grace. This family saga is a tribute to women and mothers everywhere, even those we have forgotten. I saw some reviews saying how this book treated men poorly and two-dimensionally, but I disagree. Dinah treated her male relatives with respect, and her later hatred of them was for personal reasons only- not just because they were men. The reason the men weren't as fleshed out as the women is simply because Dinah did not know them as well. She was surrounded by women, so that's what would have stuck with her. 

It seems the more impressed I am with a book, the less I have to say about it. Overall a beautiful, sad story about womanhood and family that I whole-heartedly recommend."
150,The Red Tent,0312353766,Anita Diamant,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"Although Diamant's depiction of the life of Dinah may differ from the version given in the Bible, this does not make her tale invalid. The many details in the book make it clear that the time period and status of women has been researched to the very utmost...whereas during the time of the Bible, women were not given a voice...these things were ignored. It was a highly moving tale... and who is to say that Joseph did not become selfish, or that Dinah was not in love with Shalem? Would Dinah have been asked before her history was recorded so briefly? A moving, captivating read, that I would recommend not only to women but to anyone willing to keep an open mind."
150,The Red Tent,0312353766,Anita Diamant,Barnes and Noble,4.4,ParkerEE,"The Red Tent is about Dinah, daughter of Jacob, who is one of the characters in the Bible. It tells the story of life growing up during Biblical times and the struggles for women.  It starts of with Dinah living with her mothers and their responsibilities in the community.  Their connection with each other helps them through the struggles they endure because they have to live with someone with different beliefs and on his own mission of shaping Christianity.  We then follow Dinah to Shechem where she learns to become a midwife and falls in love with a prince, Shalem.  After they are married, her brothers, Levi and Simon, slaughter her husband because they felt he had taken their sister without permission.  Dinah is then left with Shalem's mother, Re-Nefer, and they run away together to Egypt to live with her brother.  In Egypt, Dinah raises her son and remarries.  Eventually, she is confronted with her past when she runs into Joseph, Jacob's son.  But is able to go back to her life in Egypt, leaving her past behind her.  Dinah's story is one of empowerment and overcoming of obstacles.   What I really liked about this was that it didn't feel like a Biblical tale but an almost non-fiction documentary on the women's life in ancient times.  I recommend this book because it provides insight on a more difficult time and how women have always been fighting for their freedom and a place in history."

I am 30 yr old lawyer and have read all of them. They are basically just alot of fun. The greek mythology is interesting because I dont really know much about it. The writing is mostly the same from book to book with the same types of battles and issues for Percy and his friends to endure, but it is fun enough where it doesnt get boring even after the 5th book. These will not be repeat reads for me, but they are a fun way to space out each night and explore Percy Jackson's world. Fun and enjoyable books for any age."

The characters were engaging and memorable with funny and poignant dialogues. She especially liked Tyson. She really enjoyed the story and wants to read more. She has even attempted to read some of it on her own which is difficult for her so that tells you how much she liked it.

152,Dear John,0446528056,Nicholas Sparks,Barnes and Noble,4.3,SHARON39,"Another brilliant piece of writing! John, Savannah and Tim in North Carolina; all about love, patriotism, heartache, tragedy, romance and sacrifice to bring you the tender trappings to capture your heart and bring you to tears. Compelling and full of compassion! You can't go wrong with Nicholas Sparks!"
152,Dear John,0446528056,Nicholas Sparks,Barnes and Noble,4.3,BookCatTF,"I love Nicholas Sparks' writing and was really looking forward to reading this book, but I didn't enjoy it as much as other Sparks books.  I didn't connect with Savannah at all and found her to be a little annoying at times.  The part of the book I did like was the part that dealt with John and his father, but that isn't really the main focus.  It seems that Sparks' books are starting to fall into a formula, and the father-son relationship broke out of that and was a nice change. Since the movie The Notebook was done so well (I enjoyed it more than the book itself), it seems like Sparks writes his books with the intent that they will be made into movies where the characters will define themselves rather than for the books to stand on their own. My favorite Sparks book is A Message in a Bottle - Dear John can't compare to that in my opinion, but I will still read Sparks because I know when he hits the mark for me, it's a great read. (oh and I hope it's not true that the movie will have Miley Cyrus as the Savannah character.... ughhhh now I can't watch it! sorry hannah fans!)"
152,Dear John,0446528056,Nicholas Sparks,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Coether,"I have read just about every novel Nicholas Sparks has written. Even though I've enjoyed and loved them all, Dear John was different. Dear John was by far one of Spark's best work. He created dynamic characters and I enjoyed discovering their personalities and lifestyles. The path Spark's chose to lead him to the ending of this novel was amazing.

John Tyree was a teenage rebel raised by a father who wasn't capable of showing affection. He grew up misunderstanding his father and ultimately blaming him for certain aspects of his life. One evening he realizes he's been throwing his life away. After a couple days of pondering, John decides to join the army. This was the biggest decision of his life and it truly defined him. The army turned him into the wonderful man he has become. 

Somewhere along the way John met Savannah. Their time together was limited. She was working on building a house as part of Habitat for Humanity and he was returning to duty in two weeks. Their relationship started out as friendship but quickly evolved into much more. They had found in each other something they hadn't been able to find with anyone else. They found love.

John returns to the army vowing to return for Savannah. Savannah too vows to wait for John. The distance strengthened their relationship until John broke his promise. His actions were reasonable but the damage they caused was life altering. His decision to re-enlist after 9/11 prolonged the beginning of John's live with Savannah. It simply became too much to handle. The distance between them began to weaken their relationship and there was nothing either of them could do but watch it begin to fall apart. It wasn't what either of them expected or wanted, it came unwelcomed. Neither John nor Savannah could prevent it and it tore them apart from each other.

Even though Dear John had a bittersweet ending, it was the proper ending. This novel is worth reading over and over and over again. I've read it twice and even though I know and understand the ending, I can't help but wish their story never ended."

City of Ashes is awesome. I loved City of Bones equally as much, and the writing is really amazing. 
What's up with some people not really liking Simon though? I love him. What an awesome friend. At times, I was really rooting for him even more than Jace. Considering the current circumstances, I guess Jace and Clary would be pretty... disturbing. (But I still don't think they are related at all. Does anyone? I mean really?)

I teach this particular Shakespeare play in my sophomore English classes, along with Much Ado About Nothing...my favorite comedy! The fact that the left-hand side of the page contains notes, definitions is invaluable to me as a teacher (saves time from having to explain EVERY SINGLE WORD) and makes the student feel more capable of digesting Shakespeare's language. The introductory notes on Shakespeare's life, the theater, his language, wordplay are all invaluable tools to use in teaching. I now only use this version to teach all Shakespeare plays. Bravo!"

Now, I don't know if adults want this for teenagers, but this book made me think and wonder. This book made me want to close my eyes in corporate America, and open them in Middle Earth. I saw the story with my eyes, and every time I put the book down I kept seeing it. I would be walking around and my peers would turn into Elves, and my teachers would turn into Orcs! I connected to this book so much. It made me feel like Frodo is my closest friend and Saruman my most loathed enemy. The return of Gandalf the White made me feel like my Grandfather was back from the Dead! However, by putting me in a world so different from this one, it made me wish I could never leave the world of J. R. R. Tolkien. This book  put me in a different world entirely and filled me with wonder. And I wish that it gives you the same.

Reading it was like pushing myself through a marathon I had not yet trained for. But I read The Two Towers in just one week, and I read slow and have a busy schedule. The most amazing things about the books, to me, is how they tend to build your respect for Peter Jackson and his writing team to an all-time high. The changes they made for the movies were many, but necissary. This book doesn't read straight through following a chronological timeline. It jumps back and forth quite often (but Tolkein at least kept that very easy to follow). The Two Towers was extremely suspensful and terrifying at times even though I know the movies very well. I am sad for anyone who does not read The Lord of the Rings books even if they've seen the movies. There's a reason these books are on nearly ever Must Read List in the world. Pick 'em up and see why for yourself."

160,Great Expectations,0192833596,Charles Dickens,Barnes and Noble,4.5,songcatchers,"Great Expectations was a satisfying read. It had depth and a lot of humor that I wasn't expecting.

The story follows Pip through much of his life starting in childhood. I enjoyed the first part of the book the most....it was very funny. Pip helps an escaped convict which will have repercussions throughout the rest of his life. He is given a fortune from an anonymous benefactor and moves to London with 'great expectations' of becoming a gentleman and furthering himself in life. All does not go according to his expectations though and many lessons are learned.

The first part of Great Expectations was excellent. It was surprisingly funny and very thrilling and fast paced. Comparatively, the last half dragged a bit. That's not to say it was boring though. The characters kept it interesting. Great Expectations contains some wonderful characters...one's you don't want to miss! This is definitely a book to be read by anyone who enjoys literature and I'm certainly glad I did."

I believe the book provides wonderful insight into the division of social classes during the nineteenth century. This book has so many eery and joyful twists and turns that it is as if it is bringing the reader on an emotional rollercoaster. I would recommend this book to anyone seeking a thrilling classic English novel that keeps the reader captivated.
160,Great Expectations,0192833596,Charles Dickens,Barnes and Noble,4.5,jannief on LibraryThing,"My first recent attempt to read Dickens and I loved it. I've enjoyed various movies made from Dickens' works but previously thought I wouldn't enjoy actually reading one. I was so wrong! I admit there were times I didn't totally understand everything that was being said - the slang and older British sayings - but what a writer! I enjoyed his humor and lesson taught. It begins with Pip as a young boy being raised by his abusive sister and her humble, quiet, faithful, plodding husband, Joe. He makes comparisons between his simple life with that of Miss Havisham's weathly one and decides that being wealthy was more important. When given an opportunity for wealth, he pursues it but in the course of time, comes to realize what really is more important. I really enjoyed it immensely and am looking forward to reading more of his works."
161,"The Return of the King (The Lord of the Rings, #3)",0345339738,J.R.R. Tolkien,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Anonymous,"I first read the trilogy while in high school in the late 60s.  I remember that when I finished The Two Towers the local bookstore had to special order The Return of the King.  I had to wait almost two months for it to arrive, so I could devour it in one day.  A simply superlative story, but when I got to the appendices with the backstory of the peoples, history and languages of Middle Earth, I became a true believer.  Truly, this could not be fiction! I don't know how many times over the last 40-odd years I've re-read these books.  My wife and all my now grown children lived in awe and fear of Dad's discussion of them.  In every fantasy series I've read since then, I've seen Tolkien's hand in their conception.  When the movies came out, I was torn between dread and anticipation.  I'm glad to see happen what we once thought was inconceiveable - that The Lord of the Rings could be captured on screen.  Not perfect, but good enough that a purist like me was more than satisfied.  When Sam said at the end, ""Well, I'm back"", I cried in the theater.  As close to perfection as humans can get.  If you enjoyed, were tantalized by the films -- read the books.  See in the written word what you missed visually.  I guarantee you won't regret it."
161,"The Return of the King (The Lord of the Rings, #3)",0345339738,J.R.R. Tolkien,Barnes and Noble,4.7,FantasyRider,"The Lord of the Rings novel (though sometimes called a trilogy) is perhaps the most recognized trendsetter in the arena of fantasy.  The level of detail and character evolution is incredible with no limits spared.  Tolkien is truly a gifted writer that has established a place in history for his endeavor to bring to the reader a completely new world.  Each book in the series builds on the last until the reader finds they are unable to put the books down.  While not directly part of the Lord of the Rings novel, a favorite book about Bilbo's adventures in The Hobbit or There and Back Again is a not-to-be-missed read for those hoping to understand how the adventures of the Hobbits and the Ring first began."

Tolkien,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Guest,"To appreciate Return of the King, you really must read The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers beforehand. It is the third book in the series, bringing all the elements of the story together in a resounding finale.    It starts out with the fellowship group that has divided not by choice, but by necessity.  Frodo, the ring-bearer, knows he cannot risk his friends and he's not sure he can trust them, as the ring is effecting his thoughts.    Gandalf the White and Pippin are preparing for a great battle, while Merry is helping lead a great army to the city, Minas Tirith.    As the Dark Forces are preparing to annihilate all those who oppose the Dark Lord, Frodo and Sam are getting closer to Mount Doom and Mordor, the mountain of fire, where the ring can be destroyed.    The Elves are preparing to rejoin the battle with all of their forces at the city of Minas Tirith.  Aragorn lays waiting with the forces he has assembled, but they all know that if Frodo has failed, the battle is already lost.    Will Frodo be able to separate himself from the ring or will the ring rule him?  Will his once mortal wounds heal or without the ring and the magic of the elves will he die?  All these answer can be found within the pages of Return of the King."

164,Eleanor & Park,1250012570,Rainbow Rowell,Barnes and Noble,4.4,majibookshelf,"I have no words that will do this book justice. This book is perfect in every way, from the imperfect and fractured characters, the 1986 setting, the mixtapes, walkmans, and lack of mobiles, to the raw emotional journey it took us through Eleanor and Park; two teenagers who can't seem to find a place that they belong to, an identity they could proudly call their own, a &quot;someone&quot; they could turn to for help, for love, for friendship.. until they met each other. This book is so powerful. I read it in a couple of hours and I couldn't put it down. The two POVs, switching between Eleanor and Park, gave the readers more insight on what each side is feeling, thinking, and wishing. Something we don't usually witness. These characters were layered, had flaws, faults, and a history that would bring the readers emotional pain, allow them to connect with the characters, and root for them to get together, stay together, and be whoever they wanted and needed to be. 
Rainbow Rowell's gift in writing should not be overlooked. She was able to create such an eloquent novel from a simple setting, Eleanor and Park sitting in the bus on the same chair. That is how they met, that is when we see them together for over 100 pages.. they barely talk, they barely communicate, heck, Eleanor calls him &quot;the stupid asian kid&quot; while Park is just trying to pretend she doesn't exist. Eleanor isn't the stick thin girl, no she is not obese, but she still has baby fat and people make fun of her, for that and her outrageous sense of style and bright red hair. They call her &quot;Big Red&quot;. However Eleanor ignores them, for the most part, and tries to not let them get to her. However after she and Park started talking, communicating, and getting to know each other, the bullying took a step back. Yes bullying was still a part of the novel, but me as a reader lived for the moments that Eleanor &amp; Park met because I believed they were the most gratingly honest and through them you just couldn't help but fall in love with them. 
The story is more than a love story, it also includes an abusive relationship, Eleanor's mother and her step father; How I loathed him. I also did not have any happy thoughts towards Eleanor's mother. She has 4 small children, excluding Eleanor, and she still stays in that abusive relationship, stays with the man that kicked Eleanor out of the house for a full year. There is honestly so much family issues and all of them are so realistic which is why they all hit me hard, because many people suffer from being tied to such abusive relationships, and children being the helpless victims to that. I have to say though, I loved Park's family, he is half korean, and his dad loves his mom, so glaringly obvious that it really gives the readers a clear contrast between both families. I would have to say that every single young adult reader must pick this book. Whether they enjoy contemporary or not, this book is not one to miss. I am definitely going to be getting and cherishing a copy when it is out. Rowell, you officially made me a die hard fan."

165,"A Feast for Crows (A Song of Ice and Fire, #4)",055358202X,George R.R. Martin,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"Closing my nook late last night as I had FINALLY finished A Feast for Crows, a strange feeling came over me that I haven't felt with any other installment of this brilliant series: I can't decide though if that feeling was emptiness or mere boredom. It took me almost a month and a half to finish this book, which is very odd to me because I devoured the other three within days of each other. A Feast for Crows had epic promise but it sadly fell flat for me. I didn't care (unlike so many others) that the story centered around the ""lesser"" of the key characters, actually two of my personal favorites took center stage in this work and I enjoyed their chapters the most. Something was just lacking with the rest of the story sadly, and to be brutally honest the chapters involving side-tracked quests/ takeovers, mini battles revolving around religion, and sub-plots of conquest of the sea became utterly confusing and tedious. I forced myself not to flip past anything though (and I encourage any new reader to do the same), in case I would happen to miss any interesting turn of the growing plot(s) or the non-stop introductions to fresh characters/locations. Unfortunately I still found myself hopelessly muddled and distracted, researching the houses and characters at the back of the book (several times within one chapter), trying to keep some kind of mental tally with the growing alliances and betrayals. I'm still confused to be honest. One more thing I must confess to any potential readers: The action and development of new plots to continue the rest of the series didn't appear until almost the last hundred pages (which was extremely irritating to me). Night after night, I found myself just nibbling at this feast and I hope A Dance with Dragons, followed by ""The Winds of Winter"" and ""A Dream of Spring"", once again has me singing the praises this series justly deserves. July 12th is coming!"
165,"A Feast for Crows (A Song of Ice and Fire, #4)",055358202X,George R.R. Martin,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Yoten,"This was definitely a departure from the first three books of the series. There is not nearly as much action as their is in A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, and A Storm of Swords. If you come wanting something like its chair-gripping predecessors you will be disappointed. However, if you put aside your ideas of what you think it should be and accept it on its own merits you will be treated to a soul-touchingly beautiful novel.
Because Martin chose to split this and A Dance With Dragons geographically rather than chronologically, 3 characters that are often people' favorites are left out: Tyrion, Jon, and Dany. You may dislike not reading about them, but the new viewpoint characters step up to the plate admirably and smash the ball out of the park. Brienne's quest for Sansa is fascinating. Her interactions with her travel companions are very thought-provoking and give you good insight into some people who belong to social circles we haven't seen before; the people she interacts with range from a shady former soldier who is a descendant of a once-great house to a wandering septon to the &quot;smallfolk.&quot; She gives you an excellent look at a wider variety of people than we usually get to see in Westeros.
Cersei's chapters are also incredible. Her subtle struggle for power with the Tyrells in King's Landing is gripping.
Sansa's interactions with Littlefinger are the catalysts for change in her character, and I loved reading her chapters as you see her really wake to the realities of the world.
The other new storylines are great as well. The power grab in the Iron Islands, Arya in Braavos, and the Dorne plot are all fantastic reads. The ending to the Dorne storyline sent chills down my spine.
Overall, A Feast For Crows is meandering and not very action packed. However, the loss of action is repaid in full by a more comprehensive look at the world Martin has created. You will meet entirely different types of people than in previous books. Immerse yourself in the world and join the characters on their travels and trials. You will not be disappointed."
165,"A Feast for Crows (A Song of Ice and Fire, #4)",055358202X,George R.R. Martin,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"Please ignore the negative reviews, which are solely based on the length of time between sequels, and has very little to do with the actual work itself.  I can understand the desperation fans feel, these books just draw you in and you don't want it to end, but then it does, most of the time leaving some parts of the story just hanging.  Then comes the waiting game.  The next book in the series did finally come out this year and it was wonderful... and ALSO NOT FINISHED!!  I really hope it doesn't take 6 years for the next (and maybe final) book, but can wait it out as there are many, many books out there to fill the years.  So you can get hooked now and wait with the rest of us, or wait until the series is 100% finished to start reading it, but whatever you do, I highly recommend this series!"

167,"American Gods (American Gods, #1)",0747263744,Neil Gaiman,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"This book turned me over completely to Neil Gaiman and made me drooly and ga-ga for his writing like a Twilight fangirl on too much fairy dust. I've read a few of Gaiman's works before ( The Sandman Vol. 1: Preludes and Nocturnes, Neverwhere, Anansi Boys, and Stardust), but none have blown me so completely out of the boiling seas like American Gods.

American Gods is one of the quirkiest books on American culture and belief that I've read. Told from the perspective of a particularly insightful non-American, American Gods takes a long, hard look at how cultures and religions mesh, change, and fade in the states. How do Americans define and create faith? What gods does a godless nation--or maybe an excessively god-full nation--have with not even 300 years of national existence under its belt? With ghosts, murders, gods (both forgotten and barely worshipped), Naiman weaves a tale that suspends previous conceptions of the American psyche, turns it up on its head, and makes you question, Who really is that homeless crazy in the subway station calling himself Mr. Wednesday?

Like the questions it poses, the story is not straightforward. Rather, it's a meandering road trip that takes numerous pit stops at creepy carnivals and random road-side attractions. Only, you have old worn-out gods and cranky demons for company."
167,"American Gods (American Gods, #1)",0747263744,Neil Gaiman,Barnes and Noble,4.1,cellardoor623,"I was unsure if this was my kind of book, but was intrigued by the title and therefore decided to give it a shot. After finishing the book, it wasn't at all what I expected before starting the book--it was better. I'll admit that when I first read reviews of American Gods, I didn't exactly understand what the book was about, or what I'd be getting myself into. I now understand that the reason that the synopsis were so vague, was because there is no way to describe the plot without it sounding slightly absurd. The only way to know and understand what it is about is to read it.

The tone of this book reflected the mood and feelings of the protagonist. Therefore, the language was a little crude at times. This is only natural and quite realistic in this modern day. This might bother some people, but if they get even a few chapters through the book, they will immediately see how amazing this book is.

*To get a better idea of whether or not you will like this book, the story and type of journey somewhat reminded me of Windupbird Chronicle by Murakamai. If you liked that book, you will definitely enjoy this book."

168,The Stand,0385199570,"Stephen King, Bernie Wrightson",Barnes and Noble,4.6,Pangea,"I first read the originally-published version of The Stand in 1984.  I became so immersed in it that I would pause from reading, look up and around me, and for a long, unsettling moment feel that I was one of the survivors of Captain Tripps.  I since read that version another time and then read this expanded version a few years later.  I am about to read it once more.  No other book calls for me the way this one does.

The Stand is an tale of the epic struggle between good and evil.  It is God vs. the Devil.  Liberal vs. conservative.  It is the battle between the good angel and the bad angel that reside on your shoulders, whisper advice into your ears and use your mind as their battleground.  One side will lose.  In the end, we (the survivors, yes, you will be one too) learn that while we don't get what we want, we do get what we need.  Where will you make your stand?

168,The Stand,0385199570,"Stephen King, Bernie Wrightson",Barnes and Noble,4.6,Penrose,"I'm a huge King fan, but no book I have read of his has beat The Stand.Now, in my opinion, the details and work that he puts into his characters in this book absolutely makes the book. I won't lie though, it's not for everyone. I've tried to encourage family and friends to read it, people whom I thought would have loved it, and it was just too long for them to get into.If you're not used to reading 500+ page books, you may fall out of interest. For me, I personally wish the book was LONGER. I just get can't enough, and I've read it 3 or 4 times already, and am currently reading it again.The Characters-The characters feel real. They have weaknesses, faults, and real thoughts. King's usually pretty good with giving his characters real thoughts. You warm up to the characters, you start to LIKE them, to feel connected to them. And there's some great ones in here, especially if you get the expanded version.The plot- Why haven't I read anything quite like this before? I mean, sure, ""the end of the world"" stories have been played around with, but this is definitely more realistic than any of the other's I've read. The plot isn't perfect, but that's ok. It's engaging, and it's the kind of scary where you're just hoping that nothing like Captain Tripps (the virus) ever comes to your front door. Not to mention some of the most interesting antagonists I've ever met on paper.I would definitely say that this is a MUST read for anyone who calls themselves a Stephen King fan. And for the rest of you, even though it's long, just stick with it. It's such a rewarding book to have read and I still think back to it when certain social situations and topics come up."
168,The Stand,0385199570,"Stephen King, Bernie Wrightson",Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"As an avid Stephen King reader I may be biased, but this was one of the best books I have ever read. While the beginning of the book was a bit slow, its steadily increasing pace kept me intrigued the whole way through. The detailed character descriptions give you insight and help you understand the relationships between the characters. Each character has personality traits and flaws that make them seem like the kind of people you might find in your own town. Mr. King did an excellent job of taking a difficult topic to imagine, seem so real and ominous. This is an excellent book for a book club because its ideas on society, human nature and the battle between good and evil bring up many deep and thought provoking points. I have read this book 6 times and I still have trouble putting it down when I start to read. Its not a book that I would recommend for people with light hearts or stomachs, however."

I haven't read a a decent book in a long time, so I was ecstatic to find out what this book had in store for me, and it did not disappoint. I honestly could NOT put down the book for my life, I would stay up until four in the morning reading it...I was exhausted, but the book was so worth it!I loved everything about this book, and I strongly recommend everyone to read it."

170,Digital Fortress,0552151696,Dan Brown,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Papileal714,"The novel is ingenious in a way not many other books are. In most thrillers you would expect gunfights and bombs, although the fights in this book are not run that way. They are clever battles planned through precision that will make you want to read faster so that you know what will happen. From cathedrals and hospitals in Spain to buildings in Tokyo to top-dollar facilities in the US, the book will take you on an unforgettable ride. It is a web between several stories that are happening at the same time, making your reading experience even more intense. I have read the book once and I'm going for the second time already. Nevertheless, I am still anxious to be submerged into the mystical world Dan Brown has created every time I grab the book. I strongly recommend this book. If you like puzzles that are more than what is just written on paper, this is the book for you.

The NSA is the most powerful intelligence agency in the world. It's mission to intercept and decipher computer algorithms in emails and such, so that terrorist can be intercepted before their attacks even come to light. They have already prevented 3 nuclear attacks, and dealt with thousands of terrorist threats. Without the NSA, the FBI, DEA and many other agencies that keep the world at peace would be worthless. The NSA finds itself in trouble when they learn about Ensei Tankado's new, unbreakable algorithm: Digital Fortress. 

Ensei Tankado was once one of the NSA's most brilliant cryptographers. Upon his discovery that the NSA was building a machine that could open and re-seal any email it wished to, he became outraged. Upon Commander Strathmore's refusal to abort the operation, Ensei quit his job in a fit of fury and swore that they would be sorry. A few months later, he holds the NSA hostage and possesses the world's most sophisticated algorithm.

	After the routine ID checks, finger scans and such, Susan Fletcher innocently arrives at the Scy-Sec lab only to encounter one of the rarest things she has ever seen in the NSA: Commander Strathmore's face of distress and anxiety. Even when nuclear attacks were on the border of execution, Commander Strathmore had never lost his face of confidence and determination. That day was different. TRANSLATR, a multi-billion dollar machine with three million processors that was capable of breaking sixty-four bit algorithms in a matter of seconds, had been running for sixteen hours straight. Digital Fortress was immune to the National Security Agency's mighty brain. Without TRANSLATR, terrorist would be able to chat and email with no worry of being spied on, and the US would be vulnerable to all imaginable attacks. In the meanwhile, David Becker, Susan's splendid husband, is in a corporate jet flying to Spain to assist solving the present dilemma. What he does not know is that he is in danger and is being closely watched and followed."

He apparently did not research anything about computer programming and has taken great liberties with the facts about computer hardware operations."
171,Emma,0141439580,"Jane Austen, Fiona Stafford",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"While I love Pride and Prejudice the best, Emma is definitely my second favorite of Ausent's works. I prefer the story of the former novel, but other than that I can say that I love, love, absolutely love Emma. As much as I adore Mr. Darcy (Along with every other female in the world) it must be confessed that I am madly in love with Mr. Knightly, and I read the entire book just for the scenes he is in. Although Pride and Prejudice can be called perfect, I find the Declaration-of-Love scene in Emma to be much more endearing and wonderful. I find that love of Pride and Prejudice generally has to be shared, since it is such a well known story, even to the most illiterate of people. As Emma is not as ubiquitously loved,  I feel like the book has a more exclusive place in my heart, and that makes me love it all the more."
171,Emma,0141439580,"Jane Austen, Fiona Stafford",Barnes and Noble,4.1,SillyWillyShakespeare,"Emma is a hilarious novel which I thoroughly enjoyed. As I escaped into the twists and turns of the social circle in Emma's small town, I found myself laughing, crying, berating characters, and gushing about how much I loved this book. Emma's blindness to what is going on around her in the way of love endears her even more. Emma is beautiful, charming, and what every young lady in those days ought to be. She's a dutiful daughter, and usually very proper, though she has a love of matchmaking, something she really isn't very good at. She encounters very memorable characters and finds herself in the end."
171,Emma,0141439580,"Jane Austen, Fiona Stafford",Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"Jane Austen is one of the most talented novelists I know of.  The first book I read by Austen is Pride and Prejudice, and when I had the opportunity to read another for pleasure as well as academics, I couldn&rsquo;t pass it up.  The novel, Emma, consists of advanced vocabulary and complex word phrasing, but with a dictionary by my side, nothing was in my way. 

Once I picked it up, it was hard to put it back down.  In the novel Emma, Emma Woodhouse is the only lady in the house of many men.  She therefore makes all the important decisions and has a degree of power and independence. Throughout the life of Emma, there are many situations in which any typical teenage girl can relate to.  Emma doesn&rsquo;t believe in finding her so called soul mate, so she meddles with others&rsquo; to help them find theirs.  Regardless, she is admired and respected by all.  One of the most powerful messages I acquired from this novel is learning that you cannot prevent the inevitable.  Whatever road you are on is the one you are meant to take.  To get to the man of her dreams, Mr. Knightley, it wasn't quite the simplest road ever.  She goes through five weddings, a half-dozen major misunderstandings, and 400 pages pass before she learns of it, but Emma's ending is as happy and triumphant as the close of Pride and Prejudice. 

            In the beginning of the book up until about the 250 page mark, the story is somewhat slow, but as Emma discovers that her love matchmaking isn&rsquo;t quite working out for her, Mr. Knightley&rsquo;s charm speeds up the book.  Although the language is somewhat difficult to interpret, it's worth the read.  The story is witty, charming and full of loveable characters. I guarantee that you will have the hardest time putting the book down.

Although Emma is one of the longer books Jane Austen has written, it is inspirational in every way from beginning to end.  It is a comedy of Emma as she learns to find her happily ever after.  Emma is, without a doubt, one of the best books I have read in a very long time. I rarely ever have the time to pick up a well written book and read it from front to back, but I can honestly say that this book fulfilled that need; definitely a good book to pick up on a rainy weekend."
172,Anna Karenina,0345803922,"Leo Tolstoy, Louise Maude, Leo Tolstoj, Aylmer Maude",Barnes and Noble,3.4,MarkedByBooks,"Now, I know that this is quite out of the norm for our blog. I know that this book is not supernatural or anything magical. Still, I have a passion for the classics and thought, &quot;Hey, why not?&quot; So, for any one who might want to read something out of the norm, here you go.

Let me start off by saying that this book is LONG! I know, that is a little obvious, but I feel the need to express it. It took me two weeks to read this book and seeing as how I read &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; in three days, the length and details of this book can be determined with that information.

So when the book starts off, we expect it to be about some woman named Anna Karenina right? Well, its not. That is the first unique thing about the book. The book begins with Oblonsky, the unfaithful older brother to Anna. So this in itself is something to help foreshadow the events of the book. Basically, there is an affair which gives you a pretty good foreshadowing of what is to come....Need I say more?

Throughout the book, the point of view changes but the point remains the same. Love. Betrayal. Death. What more could you want?

173,A Clockwork Orange,0393312836,Anthony Burgess,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"This book goes after some truly weighty subjects in a short time frame. Burgess tells the story of his narrator, Alex, who is a clearly intelligent young man who has focused his youthful talents on setting out each night to terrorize the innocent citizens of a futuristic London. The book is famous for Burgess' heavy use of a made-up slang that a committed reader will pick up quickly using context clues. It actually serves to focus your attention on the book rather than as a distraction. Further, Burgess uses the slang to differentiate groups of characters within the book and, in some of the book's most interesting moments, one side of a character from another side within himself. The dichotomies created are very clear without being ham-fisted. Very well done. Burgess really creates a gritty, enveloping sense of place and mood as Alex and his pals meander through the city. As the reader, you simultaneously feel their sense of power (empty though it may be) and the victim's sense of fear and helplessness. Another great exploration of the duality of character within each of us, and yet this is still just a warm up for the main event! The story hits its peak once Alex is sold out by his pals and captured by the police (who aren't really good guys). Alex volunteers/is chosen for a new procedure which will ""cure"" him of his evil tendencies. The scenes of brainwashing that follow are wonderfully crafted and this whole segment of the book artfully asks whether it is better to have a choice between good and evil when only a portion of us will choose good, or whether it is better for all of us to be good even at the cost of our free will. It's a tremendous look at freedom vs. authoritarianism in all its forms. As Alex is released back into the world, we see the flip side of his original self, someone incapable of any form of evil. The string of events that follows brings up as many penetrating questions for the reader as any other portion of the book. Alex finishes (if you get a book with the 21st chapter - make sure you do) slightly older, with more perspective on his situation. A book about the two sides, we all have within us and the freedom some of us have, and some of us lack to let the two sides out. Highly recommended, you can see why this one has stood the test of time."
173,A Clockwork Orange,0393312836,Anthony Burgess,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"The reason I started reading this was because someone gave me a shirt with Stewie from Family Guy dressed as Alex, not know that was who he was potraying. Anyway, one of my teachers recognized it and told me I shouldn't read the book or watch the movie because of it's content. I didn't listen- I was too intreged- and went out and got the book. I am so glad I did what I did. I read it cover to cover, then read it again. I was so shocked at the boldness and brilliance of a simple novel- scratch that, it's not simple at all. It is riviting. I am still only a child- a teenager, if you will- and I have to say this is probably going to be one of my all time favorite books. The use of the slang, Nadsat, is quite clever and even catchy. After reading it, I spoke in mild Nadsat for quite a while- I still am. Anyway, this is a near perfect novel. I absolutly love it. It is even shocking. A warning, though- this is not a book for the faint at heart. If you can't take some graphic sence and brutal honesty without a trace of shame to be told (sometimes), I will not suggest you partake in this literary adventure. For everyone else, read the book!"
173,A Clockwork Orange,0393312836,Anthony Burgess,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"A book potent with unchecked violence, A Clockwork Orange addresses the need of the presence of evil in order for good to exist. Alex, the epitome of such malevolence, is a barbaric character that captures the essence of a criminal's need to instill fear and harm in others. As the story unfolds, Alex's moral choice is ripped away via classical conditioning: music, in which he once found a twisted pleasure, causes him physical pain instead, preventing him from unleashing any more harm on his fellow human beings. Despite  his apparent 'treatment', Alex is still thrust into malignant situations. Written by a prominent Catholic, the book depicts an absence of religion and morals in a future society. By doing so, Anthony Burgess directly answers a question asked by many: if a god exists, why does he permit the world to live in such an evil state? He insists that man needs to have the choice of doing something right in order for it to be done in pure righteousness. Religious views aside, many people would be able to get into reading this book. The language is unlike any other written before it, as the criminal youth speak in a fictional dialogue that depicts their unrefined, savage nature. The manner in which life is governed in the book, whether bullied by Alex and his 'droogs' or the government's unethical rehabilitation of criminals, raises questions about the treatment of others. Despite the sometimes-disturbing images in this book, I definitely recommend this book to those who wish to read in order to gain something. A Clockwork Orange has much to offer."
174,The Shack,0964729237,William Paul Young,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"I had very mixed feelings about reading a book about God that was on the best seller list and was being sold at Costco and Walmart.  When I was given a copy by a good friend, I decided to dive in and see what the fuss was about.  I was shocked at how good it was, especially given all the negative things people have said about it (bad writing style, odd characters, odd theology, etc.).  I found it to be an extraordinarily good depiction of the relationship within the Trinity, what that implys for God's relationship with us, and how God's love reaches out to us in our pain and confusion.I have been a committed Christian since I was very young, but have struggled for years with the certainty that I could never live up to God's standards.  By nature, I have been an intellectual Christian v.s. a relational one, and have always been somewhat suspicious and resistant to relationships of any kind, particularly when they involved religion or God.  The Shack's amazing narratives between Mack and God so captured my heart (where did that come from?!), that I've been on a trek ever since to discover more about who this God is (the theology of the Trinity, etc.), how He works in our lives and how I can rest in his love.  Its been an amazing journey!  I highly recommend The Shack.  Ignor the negative comments about it and make up your own mind. (Don't take my word for it, or theirs!)  What is clear from reading the blogs is that it has touched many people's lives, especially those who have wrestled with loss of loved ones or other personal tragedies.  There is also many positive scholarly reviews as well as negative ones (seems to be somewhat a function of vested interests in their own books and teachings).  If it speaks to your heart as it did mine, it will be worth everything to you."
174,The Shack,0964729237,William Paul Young,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Janna6,"Controversy. This book has certainly caused plenty of it. Just go look at the reviews on amazon.com and see what I mean - over 1700 reviews have been done on this book - and while over 200 only gave it one star - over 1200 gave it 5 stars. And I find most of the people that don't like this book tend to be filled with the spirit of religion and they couldn't see fresh insight and wisdom if it punched them in the face.For me personally, this book was an eye-opener to things deeper spiritually. I was raised in a Christian home and accepted Jesus when I was 8. I have never gone into a deep backslide, things haven't always been perfect, but I've never strayed from God. But I think there are some basic truths in the Bible that we as people tend to overlook, or maybe its just that we can't grasp it in our human minds - but these are some of the things that made this book so amazing to me...1) Jesus is pictured as a man who desires to be our friend and confidante. Plain and simple. How many of us actually talk to Jesus like we would talk to our best friend over a coke? The Shack illustrates that.2) The Holy Spirit is visualized beautifully as moving and vibrant with colors, changing and shifting and like a hummingbird - impossible to catch but all around. There are conversations that will open your eyes to who the Holy Spirit really is.3) Probably the biggest controversy is over how God is portrayed and I think that is tragic. We try and put God in a box (a very small box) and in this book God breaks out of that box - and it really showed me that we don't allow ourselves to see all aspects of God - CS Lewis portrays Jesus as Aslan the lion, God created man, woman and all animals - why do we limit him to a man?Forgiveness, Grace, Peace, Love and many other issues are dealt with in ways that will blow your mind. The beauty of this book is that it is fiction - FICTION people! There is a story, plot and characters to drive the spiritual wisdom and insight in it. Too many critics have tried to discredit this book as having false teachings and theology - to them I say this :It is a fictional work - not the word of God and William Young has never claimed otherwise!****Be warned - this book is a two read book - you read it once to get the storyline and mystery figured out and glimpse some of the wisdom available - you read it a second time to soak up the insight and underline a lot! ****"

I'll admit, I'm sad to see it end, but I'm sure I'll read the books enough times to nearly memorize them. The first thing that caught my attention about these books were the chapter titles. I love how they make absolutely no sense until you actually read the book. I showed my friends and they're all, ""What the HECK?"" I did that at first too. Percy Jackson, if it was you against Harry Potter, even with his magic you would win in a battle. I'm sure Riptide could DEFINITELY help with that (Not to mention maybe some water, but that's ok if there's none, 'cause you're awesome).

So I thought I would read Crime and Punishment, since I love crime stories so much. I really did not expect myself to love this book so much. It was so intense and thrilling. I read the last 130 pages in one sitting it got so intense. During the last pages, all of the subplots finally climaxed and I realized they were more than just subplots. The ending was great, I nearly cried when the book was over. This is one of the few books that when I finished, I wanted to start reading it all over again. I would recommend this book to anyone, it is not such a hard read at all."
177,Crime and Punishment,0143058142,"Fyodor Dostoyevsky, David McDuff",Barnes and Noble,4.2,mr_antoine,"Immediately upon reading the first few chapters of ""Crime and Punishment"" by Fyodor Dostoevsky, it should be blatantly obvious to any reader that this book is a brilliant classic. Upon first sight, this book would seem as though it would be a typical whodunit murder book, but on the contrary, the book revolves around not the details of the murder of a bitter pawnbroker in St. Petersburg, but the details of the conscience of a rather unscrupulous figure who is the protagonist, Raskolnikov. The psychological level upon which impoverished Raskolnikov functions on is beyond the scope of certainly what most people I know can even comprehend, delivering intricate insights into the mind of a genius who is capable of the most heinous crime a human can commit. The book is one I would recommend everyone read at least once in their lifetime, if they have the patience to press through somewhat difficult yet adaptable Russian names such as Zossimov, Koch, and Razumikhin, which can add to the confusion of the plot at times, and the energy to push through this fairly lengthy book. If you have the capacity to take on the self-inflicted wound that is a Dostoevsky book, by all means, conquer the mountain of a read, as although this book was the most difficult I have read, it is easily my favorite book. Because I have never read any of Dostoevsky's books other than ""Crime and Punishment"" and I quite honestly cannot even begin to recall books to compare to this paramount novel, I cannot recommend any books from my own experience. However, I can say that ""Notes from the Underground"" would be the next logical progression from this book, as it dives into existentialism, the psychological concept which Dostoevsky is most notorious for coining and developing. ""Crime and Punishment"" is a deep book that is worthy of any respectable reader's collection and time, due to its psychological complexity and captivating intellectual nature."

The book begins with Esther, the main character, and her experience during an internship in New York. She finds herself unhappy with what is happening in her life. Her unhappiness escalates quickly and continues throughout the book. The book gives a clear depiction of how depression can consume your life. 
	
 Throughout the novel, Esther's slowly grows and pulls you as a reader in. Plath's description of Esther's decent into ""the bell jar"" is chilling; it almost seems that her depression is logical. The bell jar being Esther's feeling of being trapped and suffocated. Soon Esther finds herself unhappy with everything and resorting to unhealthy measures. 
 
 I thought this book was a gripping view into a girl's life. It was not action packed of filled with suspense but it was a interesting tale of how deep someone can fall into depression. I would recommend this book to others. It has great description and good attention to detail. Overall the books writing style can really grab you if you let it."

But beneath this perfection pops up the depression which strangles her joy and smears misery into everything she does.

McCourt's writing style draws the reader into his tale and creates pictures from his words that make readers seem like they are actually there. The memoir begins in New York in a small cramped apartment where McCourt lived for the first four years of his life. His parents had come to America with the hopes of living the American Dream, but instead their family encountered a struggle for food, clothing, and money. After enduring the hardships of America, the McCourt family decided to move back to Ireland in the hopes of finding a better life back in their homeland; however they again did not succeed in creating a better life for themselves. Despite the promises made by Frank's father to bring home money for his family, his alcoholic father continued to spend all of his paycheck on ""the pint"" leaving no money left over for his family. This left Frank and the rest of his family to fend for themselves in anyway they could. Frank's mother would beg the church for money, and Frank and his siblings would steal whatever food they could. They lived in tattered clothing and a worn down house, with hardly any food. Frank also endured hardships within school and his church. His teachers constantly called him stupid, beat him, and shot him down because of his ranking within society. However, Frank does finish school, proving his intelligence. Frank's school and church had consistently told that he has to die for God just as Jesus Christ died for our sins, however his father continuously tells Frank and his siblings to die for Ireland because it is the only worthy thing to die for. Frank becomes confused about life because he was never taught that there was anything to live for. After his father leaves for England to find work, Frank realizes that he must live to provide for his family and make a better life for himself and do more than what people expect from him. In his memoir, McCourt points out, ""People everywhere brag and whimper about the woes of their early years, but nothing can compare with the Irish version: the poverty; the shiftless loquacious alcoholic father; the pious defeated mother moaning by the fire; pompous priests; bullying schoolmasters; the English and the terrible things they did to us for eight hundred long years"" (McCourt11). Despite all of these hardships and obstacles, McCourt endures and learns to overcome the challenges that life throws at him. Angela's Ashes is a truly inspirational story full of perseverance, determination, and most of all, hope for the future. It teaches the reader to appreciate what they have and recognize the hardships that others must face. McCourt's writing style engages the reader in the tale and allows them to feel the same sadness, humor, joy, and anger that Frank McCourt felt throughout his childhood. Frank McCourt's story is a emotional rollercoaster, and in the end, it is well worth the ride."

179,"Angela's Ashes (Frank McCourt, #1)",0007205236,Frank McCourt,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"Touching and Fantastic. The novel Angela&rsquo;s Ashes by Frank McCourt centers around the author&rsquo;s life as a child and young man, dealing with such problems as heartbreak, alcoholism, and poverty. Throughout the book, events occur in Frank&rsquo;s life that bring many hardships, but Frank sets goals for the future and remains hopeful. This book includes references of his family being Irish, moving from place to place, World War II, and relationships, and reflects how hard life really is for some people. I strongly recommend adults and teenagers to read this book because of my strong experience with reading it. Although almost the entire book was sad, the character development and emotion you walk away with is just incredible. Something I really enjoyed about this novel was the adventure carried throughout by Frank and his family page to page and that Frank never begged and was very self-respected and independent. On the other hand, my only disappointment was how painful it was to read and become a part of; the feeling of being in Frank&rsquo;s shoes doesn&rsquo;t have a point of relief or comfort in my opinion. Sensitive people like me, whom may shed many tears on their book, should absolutely still read this book; it is an eye-opener. Some of the many messages conveyed through the words of McCourt is honesty about struggle and being hopeful, thankful, and strong as well as how it feels to be very poor. For me, the themes of hunger and storytelling stood most outward during my read, and gave me a reality-check on how simple and carefree my life was and is growing up not in a broken or poor house. The author did a stupendous job of putting the reader in his shoes, and I overall rate this book five out of five stars."
180,Siddhartha,0553208845,"Hermann Hesse, Hilda Rosner",Barnes and Noble,4.2,wmorin76,"I had to read this book for a literature class in high school. Lately, I've been returning to some of my high school assignment books to see how they read now that I'm older and in a different mind-set. The first time I read this, I wouldn't say that I hated it, just rather indifferent to it. I just re-read it and......wow! What a great story about the search for wisdom and enlightenment. It makes the very valid point that while knowledge can be taught from one person to another, wisdom simply cannot. It is acquired through one's own experiences. No truer words were ever spoken and I think it is a point that not everyone recognizes.
A wonderful and relatively easy reader, Siddhartha contains messages that can be appreciated by anyone who questions the hardships and meaning of life."

Its   prose is simple, but it's what's written between the lines that   is so thought provoking.  I would actually say that this book   changed my life  every time I am going through a rough   time, I think back to Siddhartha and I'm calmed a bit.  Pure   wisdom."

181,In Cold Blood,0679745580,Truman Capote,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"I have given this title five stars because the five stars represent an 'outstanding' work.  In Cold Blood is certainly that  an outstanding work.  However, there was little to enjoy but the style, the pure ease at which this tale stretches its legs in your imagination and makes itself at home...A little too at home.  I am haunted by this, Mr. Capote's masterpiece.  The sheer omniscience which Mr. Capote achieved through so many hours, days, months, years of research bring to the page the godlike perspective one expects from a well crafted work of fiction.  While I have heard from some sources that this work was embellished, I am hard pressed to believe that the core tale is any way affected by fabrications.  Reader beware  you shall know know both slayer and slain.  And, if in the end you put this down untouched, unmoved, unshaken, I hope to God that you just didn't understand it.  Consider this review both a reccomendation, and a warning."
181,In Cold Blood,0679745580,Truman Capote,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Irina_28,"November 14, 1959 started out as an ordinary Saturday morning; running errands, working on the ranch and baking apple pies. The Clutters were well known in Holcomb, Kansas. Holcomb being a small town, it's inhabitants knew everything about eachother, for example how Mrs. Clutter suffered from ""nervous episodes"" and how Nancy and Bobby Rupp have been dating for some time now. That same day, Dick Hickock and Perry Smith were planning a ""score."" Sunday morning, four bodies were discovered in the Clutter's house: Herb Clutter, Bonnie Clutter, Nancy Clutter and Kenyon Clutter. All were murdered by a shotgun held a few inches from their faces. The shocking deaths became the headlines of every newspaper and magazine. Rumors started, panic rose, paranoia struck. Meanwhile, Perry and Dick escaped and were trying to fulfill their dreams in Mexico. After some failures and money problems, they returned to the states. A former inmate of Dick and Perry hears of the murders and turns them in. The hunt is on. When they both were found, they were questioned and eventually sentenced to death. This ""true account"" is a never ending battle between man verses man verses self. 
A major theme is the idea of the American Dream. Herb Clutter lived what seemed a perfect life, ""He was, however, the community's most widely known citizen...he had headed the building committee for the newly completed First Methodist Church...was currently chairman of the Kansas Conference of Farm Organizations, and his name was everywhere respectfully recognized..."" (Capote 6). He had power, money, a beautiful family, happines and respect. This story just puts a twist on the American Dream; it can't be fulfilled in this blood thirsty world. 
My favorite part of the book was getting into the criminals' heads. Just knowing the little things that made Perry who he was, made the story that more real, ""On the cover of the second notebook, the handwriting of which he was so proud, a script abounding in curly, feminine flourishes, proclaimed the contents to be ""The Private Diary of Perry Edward Smith""- an inaccurate description, for it was not in the least a diary but, rather, a form of anthology consisting of obscure facts, poems and literary quotations, and passages for newspapers and books paraphrased or quoted"" (Capote 146). I really enjoyed reading about the thought processes of Perry. It's easy to tell that Truman Capote took an interest in Perry's life, and really analyzed him well. I also loved the amount of detail Capote put into his research and eventually, the novel; his writing sucks you in and makes you experience every bit of the situations. I don't think there was anything I didn't like about this book, whether it was, Capote's writing style or the characters in it, i loved it all.
In Cold Blood first and foremost, just makes you realize how far the human mind can really take you, secondly, how no one is innocent, thirdly, sometimes the world is not just, but someone has to pay, and finally, Capote makes you realize that anything can happen in this world..."
181,In Cold Blood,0679745580,Truman Capote,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,In Cold Blood is one if not the best true crime books I ever read.  The way Truman Capote describes the murders. It made me feel that I was there with that poor family.  It is always interesting to me everytime I read it to decide what I would do if I was with The Clutter family to try to escape from Richard Eugene Hickcok and Perry Smith's muderous rath.  It is trully a chilling masterpiece.  I loved every minute reading it.
182,"Beautiful Creatures (Caster Chronicles, #1)",0316042676,"Kami Garcia, Margaret Stohl",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Kim-Franklin,"Words, alone, cannot effectively express the LOVE I feel for this book. For this one, I definitely need more than words. Maybe words, mixed with a myriad of blissfully, excited facial expressions, with lots and lots of exaggerated hand movements thrown in, may paint a clearer picture. But, then again, I'm not so sure that would even suffice in capturing the intense feelings I harbor for this book.

Beautiful Creatures is a must read for 2009! Possibly for 2010 and 2011, too! It is one of those books you want to snuggle on the couch with and read its entire contents, start to finish (yes, all 567 pages) in one sitting. It's almost as if the pages themselves have been laced with some sort of happy drug, which successfully pulls you out of this world and transports you straight into the beautifully written pages this novel holds. I'm constantly searching for books like Beautiful Creatures--novels that are so yummy and delicious that you have to restrain yourself from devouring, at once-- and I'm so happy I just happened to stumble across this masterfully written, epic novel. Lucky me!

The two main characters, Lena and Ethan, seem like real people. Almost as if, Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl, plucked two unsuspecting teenagers from a nearby high school and inserted them into this wonderfully captivating story. What's so fascinating about these two characters is the fact that they're so real, yet so different from anyone else, at the same time. (Pure genius, I tell you!)

Lena Duchannes is unlike anyone the small Southern town of Gatlin has ever seen, and she's struggling to conceal her power and a curse that has haunted her family for generations. But even with the overgrown gardens, murky swamps and crumbling graveyards of the forgotten South, a secret cannot stay hidden forever.

Ethan Wate, who has been counting the months until he can escape from Gatlin, is haunted by dreams of a beautiful girl he has never met. When Lena moves into the town's oldest and most infamous plantation, Ethan is inexplicably drawn to her and determined to uncover the connection between them.

And, in a town with no surprises, one secret could change everything.

The authors successfully weave this magical (in every sense of the word) story about Ethan, your typical high school boy, who wants nothing more than to leave his small home town of Gatlin, and an anything BUT normal girl, Lena, who craves the normalcy that so many take for granted--Ethan included. 

Along with the sweet love story, which slowly buds from friendship and beyond, there is a little bit of everything: high school drama, heart ache, acceptance, dysfunctional families (coming from both sides), a little bit of history (for all of those history buffs out there), and mystery at every turn and twist in this blissfully original plot that leaves you salivating and constantly wanting MORE, MORE, MORE!

There is no doubt in my mind that readers will snatch this book up, instantaneously, and completely devour this delicious read. Actually, I encourage this behavior because it is just that good!

Beautiful Creatures is ultimately addictive--hence the drugs--so I strongly recommend [imagine me screaming from the roof tops] for you to pick up your copy...NOW! 

Not tomorrow. RIGHT. NOW!

In the mean time, I'll be here, sitting on my couch, drooling over Beautiful Creatures, anxiously awaiting the next installment of this five part series.

182,"Beautiful Creatures (Caster Chronicles, #1)",0316042676,"Kami Garcia, Margaret Stohl",Barnes and Noble,4.2,nikki0390,"I am a really picky reader. I read about 4 books a month...if not more..but it's always really hard for me to pick a good book. Especially now, when there are so many awful authors out there trying to be the next Stephanie Meyer...which is exactly what they are doing. To give you an example, some of my favorite authors are Patricia Briggs, Karen Chance, Cassandra Clare, J.K. Rowling and Stephanie Meyer. My mom actually picked out Beautiful Creatures for me, and because she has the same taste of book as me, I listened and read it. It was great. Now, it's not as good as the Twilight, Harry Potter, or Mortal Instrument books. I would classify it with the Witch series by Nancy Holder and Debbie Viguie. However, this book is better than the Witch Series, that's just where I would classify it around. The characters are funny and you instantly love them, such as Amma and Marion. It's an adorable love story but it also has a mix of southern ism and supernatural stuff. It's a really good book. If you like the kinds of books I do you should love it."
182,"Beautiful Creatures (Caster Chronicles, #1)",0316042676,"Kami Garcia, Margaret Stohl",Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"I'm usually a fan of YA paranormal. And I love nothing more than a big, fat book that lasts for more than a few hours.

Unfortunately, Beautiful Creatures just didn't resonate with me. It took an incredibly long time for anything to happen. The first 100-200 pages were all backstory and useless. Why would a book need to be 600 pages when more than 100 pages were pointless? It felt like very poor editing. 

And then the narrator is a fifteen year old boy with the perception and observations of a twenty-something young lady. It felt very, very off, which was disappointing. I would have loved to see a strong male lead, rather than what a girl wishes a boy sounds like. 

All in all it wasn't a bad book. Just not anywhere near the level it should be based on the hype."
183,"Clockwork Angel (The Infernal Devices, #1)",1416975861,Cassandra Clare,Barnes and Noble,4.5,La_Femme_Readers,"The Clockwork Angel instantly rejuvenated my love for YA urban fantasy. The dark, edgy quality of the writing and plot was breathtaking. Cassandra has a way of creating a world that starts to creep into your self conscious and devours your thoughts. At first, I was a bit skeptical, I didn't think this prequel would live up to the actual Mortal Instruments series. But, I was ecstatic to find out that I was beyond wrong. The characters and overall story was creative and compelling. The Victorian era was the perfect scenario with a refreshing outlook of people's mannerisms in the past. Tessa, one of my favorite characters, was a very unique individual who had the power to shift into another person. Her ability was wanted by powerful figures who managed to shake up her existence.

The moment Tessa entered the institute, I was taken back to the Mortal Instruments. I enjoyed seeing this place in a different light with assorted shadowhunters. Now, this wouldn't be a Cassandra Clare book without some drool worthy boys. The badass and cocky Shadowhunter was Will. His appearance of blue eyes and dark hair made me swoon at his every word. However, he did have moments where I would have loved to punch him. Of course we also need a nice, sensitive, good-looking boy to balance Will, and luckily I found that in Jem. He was such a sweetheart and knew just the right things to say to Will and Tessa. I felt like his name should of been 'Gem' because in my opinion, his pure heart was a rare treasure.

Also, I want to randomly point out that I love how Cassandra introduces Asian characters. I found that in Simon in the Mortal Instruments and now with Jem being half Asian. She definitely knows how to fulfill my Asian fetish in men. :) Okay then, I don't want to give too much away, because this was a book I want everyone to experience, especially Cassandra Clare fans! It had everything from amazing fighting scenes to dramatic twists and turns. The ending left me utterly speechless and I am officially hooked and cannot wait to continue on with this masterpiece of a series!"
183,"Clockwork Angel (The Infernal Devices, #1)",1416975861,Cassandra Clare,Barnes and Noble,4.5,theReader278,I loved reading this wonderful book! It is as good as the Mortal Instrument Series. It has a story that keeps you entertained for hours.
183,"Clockwork Angel (The Infernal Devices, #1)",1416975861,Cassandra Clare,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Serena-Ann,"I've heard a lot of customers talking about Clare's Mortal Instruments series, and one lady told me this is a prequel (series again) of sorts to the Mortal Instruments. I decided to read this first since I just got caught up with Gail Carriger's Parasol Protectorate series and the paranormal/victorian steam punkish style seemed to be a nice bridge to Clare's newest book. 

The main characters are teens, of course, but without the melodrama that so often kills the mood of a novel. I liked how the romance took a back seat to the actual action and plot, yet nothing felt ""thrown in"" last second. A wonderful delight to read and well worth the buy."

As a result I read about 5 or so books a week. This summer I read a few books I was really impressed with, some of the best of which are: The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculier Children, and Wonderstruck--that being said, The Night Circus blew them all out of the water. Truly, a book with just enough romance (oh how tired I have grown of those predictable books about naughty dukes with images of girls clutching their extravagant gowns as a man..you know), just enough history, just enough magic, and just enough something else to make it more than a lovely, refreshing read- it is important, significant, somehow."

I enjoyed the fact that it was based around Mary Boelyn, even after the king began to favor Ann.  Although, a story based on Ann Boelyn's point of view would also be very intriguing.  This is the first book I've read by Philippa Gregory and I'm excited to read more!  

I would also like to add, please don't read this book if you are trying to learn some hard facts.  Don't review this book and give it one star just because it's not written like a history book.  That's why it's under the fiction section!  It's mean't to be entertaining and fun and actually makes your imagination wheels spin rather than just feeding facts to mindless readers.  :) Happy reading."
186,"The Other Boleyn Girl (The Plantagenet and Tudor Novels, #9)",0743227441,Philippa Gregory,Barnes and Noble,4.5,AllOverTheBoard,"If you've seen the movie - you must read the book.  I saw the movie first and it struck my curiousity due to how it ended and the characters remaining - didn't realize the lineage of Elizabeth I - The Virgin Queen.  So I picked out several books by Gregory and read The Constant Princess first, followed by The Other Boleyn Girl.Gregory is a great writer and you get a manner of s history lesson without feeling like you're reading a text book.  Amazing what families did and put their loved one's through to gain favor with royalty - makes you thankful to be a woman in today's society.Consider this a GREAT read and can not wait to read more from Gregory"
186,"The Other Boleyn Girl (The Plantagenet and Tudor Novels, #9)",0743227441,Philippa Gregory,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"Ms. Gregory was brilliant in choosing Mary as the narrator of this book. In doing so, the manipulative and scheming nature of Anne was able to come alive, as was the unorthodox lifestyle chosen by George Boleyn, the brother. The relationship amongst the Boleyn siblings, in and of itself, could fill a novel. The complexities of a family struggling to maintain individual identities, while working to bring the family up to the highest level of stature is intense.
This book is a page turner; it is incredibly compelling, deep and fascinating. I learned a great deal about the monarchy of Henry VII as well as life in the court during that time period. At the same time, I found myself incredibly entertained and saddened when I reached the last page. I cannot wait for more from Ms. Gregory.  The sheer scope of this novel is gigantic -- there were so many things that were going on both on and off stage and the number of people that were involved in all these shenanigans! So that it was a treat to find that the novel unfolded smoothly and effortlessly, and that Gregory did not drop the ball once. She kept each chapter short and succinct, and yet still managed to give the reader an enthralling and exciting account of what was going on. I also liked the manner in which she depicted all the characters in this novel. From Queen Katherine who was portrayed not only as a loyal and loving wife, but also as an intelligent woman who saw and understood what was going on around her, even as she clung to the hope that the king would recover from his obsession with Anne; to the authour's chilling portrayal of the Boleyn family (father, mother, Anne and George). With a few well chosen words and phrases, she's paints them as wildly ambitious, ruthless and pettily cruel individuals, willing to use each other in order to achieve a particular goal. But the authour's characterization of Mary Boleyn was probably the best thing in the novel. Here we see a young and intelligent woman with a heart and a sense of morality that is constantly at war with her feeling of familial obligations. How Mary struggles with this dueling feelings and the decisions she makes -- sometimes good, sometimes bad -- is what makes this novel worth reading.
All in all, I'd say &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot; is a rich and rewarding read."
187,"Uglies (Uglies, #1)",0689865384,Scott Westerfeld,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Ishy,"Honestly, I'm the kind of girl who loves Harry Potter, Star Trek, Star Wars, and anything else fantasy and otherwise. So when I saw the cover of this book and the title, I outwardly laughed at the idiocy! But after much persuasion from my friends and countless begging, I picked it up. I was amazed at the fact that A) This is a Sci-Fi  B) It's about false utopias and  C) It's good!
The story is unique and compelling. The ideas are challenging and thought provoking and, without giving too much away, the relationship junk (my opinions are mine) isn't the main focus, but instead a great add in and is sufficient to those hopeless romantics (which believe it or not, I am). The author, although male, proves to be able to write brilliantly in the teenage girl voice that even many female writers cannot master.
I give this book an A+ for the stupendous ability to capture a harsh critic like myself."
187,"Uglies (Uglies, #1)",0689865384,Scott Westerfeld,Barnes and Noble,4.4,bookworm_157,I have read this book and the rest of this series several times. And each time I find or realize something new about the characters or the plot. It keeps you guessing no matter how many times you read it. The basic story is it is set in the future and when you turn 16 you go under the knife and be changed from an ugly to a pretty. This book follows a trouble making uglie's journey before her surgery. Makes new friends and enemies. And not only is this book good but the entire series is good! I reccomend this to anyone in need of a good book to read!!
187,"Uglies (Uglies, #1)",0689865384,Scott Westerfeld,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Amaya713,"Whenever I saw this book a while back, I never wanted to read it because the title sounded so preppy and shallow. I would have expected the book to be more of a ""girly"" book about beauty, boys, etc. etc. However, there's way more to this book that meets the eye. Once I started reading, I was hooked. This book tells the story about a future world where everyone becomes ""pretty"" on their sixteenth birthday. It was intriguing to read about such a society that focuses solely on image. It really makes you think about how we see beauty today. So many things had changed from our modern world-- it was interesting to think about. The plot and characters were also superb. The main character is Tally, an ""ugly"" who can't wait to turn pretty. But then she meets Shay. Shay is another ugly who isn't sure she wants to be pretty. She opens Tally's eyes to a whole new world, and Tally is thrust headfirst into it. The characters continue to interest you throughout the story and the plot keeps you at the edge of your seat. Overall, I would wholeheartedly reccommend this book, especially to teen readers. Despite the seemingly superficial title, this book actually has some strong morals and themes. Just goes to show, don't judge a book by it's cover (or title, in this case) ;-)"
188,"A Dance with Dragons (A Song of Ice and Fire, #5)",0000000000,George R.R. Martin,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"My review will focus on the format of the e-books and to contradict several other reviews which are incorrect.  I compared the e-books with the hard copies that I have, and these books are exactly the same as the hard copies except for the e-books' use of chapter numbers in the books' respective Table of Contents rather than character names (e.g. &quot;Chapter 1&quot; rather than &quot;Jon&quot;). They contain the Prologues of each book. The bottom line is not cut off at the bottom of each page. These are not &quot;condensed&quot; versions. I like the ability to read the bundle on one Nook device and then pick up at the same page on another Nook device without having to search where I left off (I have a Nook Tablet and also the new Nook HD+ 9 inch). The e-book bundle makes it easy to carry around all 5 stories without lugging heavy tomes around. I'm already in the middle of book 5 (Dance with Dragons), but I've forgotten some plot points and like to refer to the early books. This e-book bundle makes that easy. There is also the ability to do a word search within the e-books, if you need to find something. I don't find the Table of Contents cumbersome at all. It's easy to scroll up and down. Yes, these chapters are numbered rather than listed by character name, but since the author didn't distinguish one &quot;Jon&quot; chapter from another &quot;Jon&quot; chapter, those chapter names wouldn't have been useful anyway. All in all I'm very pleased with this e-book bundle."

191,Watchmen,0930289234,"Alan Moore, Dave Gibbons, John Higgins",Barnes and Noble,4.5,FocoProject,"So it took me this long to finally read what many people claim to arguably be the greatest graphic novel of all time: The Watchmen. That argument has been given to me for a while and perhaps it was the hype itself that made me originally reject it; or maybe it was the fact that stylistically, the artwork itself did not seem to magnetize me; or was it the character concepts with a certain old school je ne sais quoi which simply did not interest me.I finally did and though I am by no means in a position to call it or disregard it as the `greatest graphic novel of all time¿, I can say without a shadow of a doubt that it is the greatest graphic novel I have ever read. That may not mean much; though I am perhaps more familiarized with comics than the average person, my comic knowledge is still relatively limited and my hands have not held that many graphic novels to begin with. Nevertheless, it does not take an avid comic book reader to appreciate a book that contains not only finesse, but also enough smart and heady content to satisfy the most intellectual of readers.Surely, The Watchmen served as the inspiration for Pixar favorite The Incredibles, though the content has not been watered down for the younger audience. Dealing with heavy morality and ethical questions, the novel basically looks at a world where heroes were forced to retire in the seventies due to legalities, changing public perception and resentment from cops who felt increasingly marginalized and incapable of doing their job. They all seem to have settled in their retirement, some more comfortably than others, when a `mask killer¿ suddenly emerges, bent on taking out the group of vigilantes, one by one. Racing against time, the former heroes must don their costumes one more time to solve the crime that may save their lives or more importantly, the planet.After reading the novel, I have to say that my comments on the illustration remain remarkably the same. I am still unimpressed with the old school style and incredibly simple layout, though perhaps, my eyes have been opened to Dave Gibbons¿ (illustrator) own spartan efficiency. Even in its barren form, each cell seems to serve its duty with precision, in both composition and content. There may be no gravity defying poses, or humanly impossible contortions from the aged protagonists on the paper, but all the information is drawn out with a purpose which is married most interestingly with the often multi-layered content.Let it be known, this is not your typical superhero tale. It is a tale of humanity that happens to have hero¿s as its central figures, allowing for a much grander scheme which is nonetheless timeless and applicable to just about any person that has ever questioned their actions in relation to good and evil. This is exciting in that it feels refreshing and new. Considering that this graphic novel came out in the eighties, it is a surprising achievement, that it is able to hold out so well against the recent works that continuously try to paint themselves in the same light.It is perhaps that I am still elated from my read , that I fail to find any reasonable flaw with this book. It reads in complex layers and carries a theme of epic proportions and it is populated by a cast of characters that are so well fleshed out and developed, that they are likable beyond their obvious flaws, of which they have many."
191,Watchmen,0930289234,"Alan Moore, Dave Gibbons, John Higgins",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Monas,"This is an excellent novel to sit and read when all you want is something to take your mind off of the everyday. It has original characters with somewhat ""un-catchy"" names (if thats even a word) but their personalities and character make-up make up for those short comings. It is a very easy read considering that it is a graphic novel/comic book and there are a lot of pictures rather than words. But thats not necessarily a bad thing, because i believe that it helps to understand and feel the mood, setting, and situations better, they add to the drama. Over all, this is a wonderful book and a great read, i would highly recommend it."

192,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",075640407X,Patrick Rothfuss,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Hiddenmastermind,"""The Name of the Wind is by far one of my favorite novels. From the moment I read the very first paragraph, I became completely entranced. It is the story of a legendary wizard who is essentially telling the memoirs of his life to a Chronicler, who writes it all down. He brings to light the much coveted story of his past and the events which sparked rumors that eventually made him the legend he is. Patrick Rothfuss writes with such a poetic and moving quality, allowing the story to flow with such realism, even though it is a Fantasy novel. As the wizard Kvothe tells his life story to Chronicler, I was so enraptured that, in a way, I became the young man he speaks of. When young Kvothe felt nervous, I felt nervous; when he was angry, I was angered; When he was sad, I too was at the verge of tears. Rothfuss' writing truly connects the reader in such a profound way. At those times when Kvothe breaks away from his reminiscing on the past, the very emotion of Kvothe's retelling of his memories is also felt by the reader. There is such a sorrowful and mysterious quality to the character of Kvothe just brimming beneathe this utterly believable hero, and, as I read the book, I realized how talented Rothfuss really is to make the reader actually feel the experiences of Kvothe's life. This is an incredibly clever, moving, emotional, and magical book that I'm positive anyone who picks up will add to their collection of favorites. No doubt The Wise Man's Fear (The second installation of the series, coming in April 2009) will be just as intriguing."""
192,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",075640407X,Patrick Rothfuss,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Wyll,"I picked up this title for my Xmas vacation reading after seeing it on some list online. I'm happy to say that Rothfuss appears to be the next great fantasy author. I'm often disappointed with the formulaic, copy-cat fantasy works that flood the genre, but The Name of the Wind proved to be far, far better than much of the dross we see these days.The characterization is deep and engaging. The story, while not entirely ground-breaking, is compelling. What I really enjoy is the way magic works. It's very earthy and mechanistic in a way, rather than the overblown elves and wizards stuff we often see.This is great writing, and I can't wait for the next installment."
192,"The Name of the Wind (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #1)",075640407X,Patrick Rothfuss,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Guest,"I have been reading Science Fiction and Fantasy for 30   years - which is to say that I have read a lot and my   favorite authors are a) crossing the waters and thus no   longer available to provide new books or b) simply can not   write as quickly as I read. So --- it has been an ongoing   challenge to find NEW authors worth reading - there has   been an unfortunate dearth over the past decade or so of   new-to-the-scene authors who are neither so tritely   formulaic nor so determinedly different to be truly   enjoyable. Patrick Rothfuss has been a (pardon the pun)   breath of fresh air in an increasingly stale genre. This first   installment is not, however, perfect. Which is actually   something to recommend it - were it too perfect, there   would be nothing to look forward to in future books. The   premise is not altogether original (okay, it is not even a   little orginal - thief makes good has been done A LOT),   BUT, it has rarely been done within such a delightful   framework and with as much enticing mystery.     The first half of the book was definitely stay up all night to   see what happens next ...but the second half does   stumble a bit on its pacing (and as another reviewer   pointed out, an unfortunate abundance of going on and   on and on about Denna). About three-quarters of the way   through the book I started to be a bit impatient for   *something to happen* as the pace slowed considerably    and the constant bad luck for our main character started   to get wearying.     Nonetheless, the author is a fabulous writer who has done   what so few are able to do - write convincingly in both   first and third person (an oft mentioned kudo for this new   writer). It is not an unhearof device - but is rarely done   well. Patrick Rothfuss succeeds handily.     I look forward to the next installment, though I do hope   the author gains a more consistent pacing and leaves off   the moon-struck over reliance on the 'woman of mystery'   as the driving force for his lead character's subplots."
193,Outliers: The Story of Success,0316017922,Malcolm Gladwell,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Oscar_Aguilar,"I've always been curious about the archetypal ""overachieving"" type; the person with a 4.0 GPA, supplemented with a vast resume of extracurriculars and seemingly guaranteed placement at some selective, elite institution. They seem to effortlessly master their studies, creating a very bothersome imposition in the back of my mind that made me feel inadequate. For awhile, I felt that there was something innate these certain individuals possessed, hardening my fatalistic perspective about the world and making me question my own self-worth. 

Gladwell essentially put everything into perspective for me. People aren't just born ""with it."" The typical stories describing the ascent to success by prominent individuals oftentimes, if not always, obscure the social, cultural, economic, institutional and fortuitous elements that allow that person to rise in the first place. This book, replete with credible substantiations, investigates the lives of many successful people, like Bill Gates and Joe Flom, and show how particular environmental factors and fortunate circumstances led to the realization of these individuals' potential. The story of success is always more complex than the simple tales of ""rags to riches."" This book comprehensively examines not just individuals, but systems (like public education), and stereotypes (such as Asians being good at math) to provide the reader with a deeper understanding of what provides the proper foundation for high achievement. 

Though, let me be clear: this book does *NOT* suggest that sheer hard work is somehow irrelevant, or weakly relevant (i.e. ""it's all luck""), in one's pursuit of success. To the contrary, this book emphatically illustrates how crucial hard work is to the fulfillment of success. The book, however, indicates that hard work goes hand-in-hand with opportunity. Your intellectual potential might have you be a great computer programmer, mathematician, or businessman. Unfortunately, it might very well go to waste without the resources needed to foster the development of such potential. There's no point in having a warehouse of hardy seeds without the fertile soil to plant them in. 

This book has inspired me to push onward with my studies, to work incredibly hard towards mastery of subject material and to seek opportunity and claim it upon arrival. Highly recommended book! 

Another on the subject I tore through recently and recommend strongly in addition to Gladwell's book, because it's great and it includes an online test of your emotional intelligence is, Emotional Intelligence 2.0."
193,Outliers: The Story of Success,0316017922,Malcolm Gladwell,Barnes and Noble,4.1,_Mario_,"It's true, the primary premise of Gladwell's Outliers is that success is not about what we are told its about.  It¿s also true that this idea isn't anything new.  But if you're on the fence about buying this one, you should consider a few other truths about the work.  The ""successful"" people that Gladwell is referring to in Outliers are not the garden variety ""he's a successful dentist"" types.  An Outlier is not someone who made something of themselves in the sense that they earn above average income, drive high-line cars, and make six or seven figures.  Nor is he referring to wealth alone as a measure of success (J. Robert Oppenheimer is one of his Outliers).  He is talking about real - out there on the edge alone - success.  The Beatles kind of success, Bill Gates kind of success, so take with a grain of salt reviews that bash The book for being unoriginal or for not providing useful information on ""how to"" become successful.  Clarification: Reading Outliers wont help you become an outlier anymore than reading Blink will make you a better thin slicer - but his section on scholastic sports and ""gifted"" classes in grade school may make you hold your kid back a year to dramatically change their lives in a positive way.What this book is useful for is its further explanation and revelation of the true cause of something (extreme success in this case) and a pattern that has developed to explain it that has nothing to do with reality.  Gladwell's research is as solid as ever; interesting as ever; and I recommend the book as worth the purchase price.  I couldn't put it down, I took notes, underlined passages, then read it again; all without a twinge of buyer¿s remorse."
193,Outliers: The Story of Success,0316017922,Malcolm Gladwell,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Angela2932ND,"All of Gladwell's books have been fascinating reads! This book is making me think about my own growing up years/culture/class background, and the impact on my life decisions. It makes me think about decisions I've made regarding my children, and how my husband and I bring our different life stories to bear on this. Gladwell has a way of presenting social psychology through a very engaging format. The main thesis of this book is that success is an accumulation of advantages, coupled with the ""10,000 hour rule.""  The book does get to be repetitive, but is entertaining enough to make it feel worth it. I didn't alway agree with his perspective, however. An example is in presenting the KIPP schools, and the role of the extensive hours devoted to studies as a meaure of the success of the students. What bothered me about this is that it does not take into consideration the cultural context of the students, and whether this success comes at too great a cost. I would have liked to see the ""you can be successful if you put in 10,000 hours"" tempered by also raising the question of whether the ""success"" is really worth it and what such success means in terms of one's identity, value system, or other lost opportunities."

194,"Moby-Dick or, The Whale",0142437247,"Herman Melville, Andrew Delbanco, Tom Quirk",Barnes and Noble,3.7,E_Caine,"Moby Dick is one of those rare novels that captures a particular historical moment while, at the same time, remaining timeless.  Gripping drama, tense action, compelling characters and a setting so rarely glimpsed in history - the period in America between the Revolutionary and the Civil Wars.  It was a time when America was discovering itself as the characters are discovering themselves.  And it was the height of an industry of which, like slavery, we are all still a little ashamed.  Whaling was a profitable, dangerous, and engaging occupation for a young man in those days.  But when the Captain of your ship is obsessed with taking vengeance on his tormentor it would be an experience you could never forget.  Assuming, of course, that you survived.  Complicated, compelling, beautifully written, and always a classic, Moby-Dick is a must-read for any American lover of literature."
194,"Moby-Dick or, The Whale",0142437247,"Herman Melville, Andrew Delbanco, Tom Quirk",Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,"Who am I to criticize Melville? But after reading, and chuckling, over some of my peer reader's reviews, I'm compelled to balance stars. I'm neither a critic nor literary scholar. I'm just someone who loves good literature, classic or not.  Granted, Moby is long and detailed, but I contend it's all necessary and part of the story's framework. The themes are skillfully packaged in abstruse metaphors. And I agree that I had to use lexical aids to get through some of the dated vernacular. I even put down my cheap paperback for a Norton critical edition, but it was worth it. The language is beautiful and artistic. Read a benign chapter to a child and watch their expressions change as their imagination takes over their visage. Moby provides insight into today's archetypes found in pop-culture's 'Spongebob' or 'Pirates of the Caribbean'. Perhaps Moby isn't for everyone. Those who aren't interested in ages long past, historically accurate depictions of bloody exploitation, or ocular criticism of social hypocrisy, should probably stick to the bestseller lists. Entertain your brain. Every chapter is a piece of Melville's puzzle. When taken holistically, it all fits. Slow your monkey mind. Mindfully read. Open your eyes. Moby is still relevant today, especially to you good folks who think you live on that fabled 'City on the Hill'."
195,The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society,0385340990,"Mary Ann Shaffer, Annie Barrows",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Lynn_R,"I am an avid reader and this is one of the best and most touching books I've ever read.  The story's set at the end of WWII in England and Guernsey and it's written as a series of letters and telegrams between characters (well done).  You must read this book.  You will laugh, you will cry, you will grow to love these people and once finished, you will feel enriched for having come to know them while simultaneously mourning the end of your relationship with them.  This is a book to keep, to treasure, to give to friends and loved ones and to read again and again.  Is is too soon to ask for more?"

The style of the book being in letters was, initially, a little awkward.  It gave me a greater appreciation for the lost art of letter writing.  A really good story."

I'm so glad I did! The unique and original presentation through nothing more than letters was a perfect and unique method to get every character's point of view effectively. This is such a charming novel full of drama, sadness, humor, serious trauma,perserverence,tolerance, and all facets of love and relationships. Juliet, a writer, is immersed in each diverse character's inspiring story, some in dire circumstances with the horrific occupation of their island by the Germans.

196,Fight Club,0393327345,Chuck Palahniuk,Barnes and Noble,4.6,SavageBS,"Outstanding book! Power animals, split personality disorders, soap, fighting, mayhem, support groups, tainted food, castration, the book has a little bit of everything......... I unfortunately saw the movie, at least 5 times before getting around to reading this book. If you haven't seen the movie yet, STOP, read the book first! I've read two other books by Chuck Palahniuk, this one is the best so far! ""Fight Club"" is excellent, the characters, the dialogue. It's all amazing! There are so many good lines in this book, its hard to describe, but here are my favorites- ""If your a male, and you're Christian and living in America, your father is your model for God. And sometimes you find your father in your career."" ""Tyler Durden the great, who was perfect for one moment, and who said that a moment is the most you could ever expect from perfection."" ""How everything you ever love will reject you or die. Everything you ever create will be thrown away. Everything you're proud of will end up as trash. I am Ozymandias, king of kings."" There are 8 simple rules for ""Fight Club""= 1.You don't talk about fight club. 2.You don't talk about fight club. 3.When someone says stop, or goes limp, even if he's just faking it, the fight is over. 4.Only two guys to a fight. 5.One fight at a time. 6.They fight without shirts or shoes. 7.The fights go on as long as they have to. 8.If this is your first night at fight club, you have to fight. The movie adaption of this book, follows the novel pretty close! Ed Norton and Brad Pitt could'nt have done a better job! Highly recommended to everyone and especially Palahniuk fans that may never have read (Chuck's 1st book)!"

196,Fight Club,0393327345,Chuck Palahniuk,Barnes and Noble,4.6,DeDeFlowers,"Fight club is a great book. It is a unique adventure that really makes you think. It blends humor, action, and psychological-thriller style genres. All of the characters are presented as very real people. You get to know them and you have a real interest in them. The twists and turns are incredibly clever. It's a very short book, 218 pages, and is worth the time. 
Even if  you have seen the movie I think you would get a lot out of this book. While the movie and book are very much alike, they have differences that make them unique from one another. You connect better with the book, and it is still wildly entertaining."
197,"Dead Until Dark (Sookie Stackhouse, #1)",0441008534,Charlaine Harris,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Maddilyn,"I LOVED this book.  I decided to read it because I took an intrest in the HBO tv show and had just finished reading the Twilight series.  Vampire novels are a gulty pleasure of mine so when I discovered Dead Untill Dark I was thrilled.  The Sookie Stackhouse novels are definately more adult than the Stephanie Meyer books so youths be advised.  I loved everything about the world that Charlaine Harris created.  After reading her books I wanted to take a road trip to Louisianna.  Her characters are so believabe despite their mythical state.  I especially loved the modern twist she put on it.  To think that vampires would fight for equal rights and want to live as equals amoung humans is crazy to think about.  The love story that she creates between Bill and Sookie is unique despite what die hard Twilight fans might say. (Remember....Dead Untill Dark came BEFORE Twilight.) Also, the HBO show True Blood stays true to the novels for the most part and is just as addicting has the series."
197,"Dead Until Dark (Sookie Stackhouse, #1)",0441008534,Charlaine Harris,Barnes and Noble,4.2,theReader278,I loved reading this wonderful book! It is a story that keeps you entertained for hours.
197,"Dead Until Dark (Sookie Stackhouse, #1)",0441008534,Charlaine Harris,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Anonymous,"I read this book because the HBO series True Blood hooked me. I'm a sucker for Anna Paquin and love Alan Ball, so this show was right up my alley and I figured the book might be too. Within the first chapter or so, I decided I would finish Dead Until Dark. I hate to stop a book midway through, but probably wouldn't continue on to the next books in the series. Sookie Stackhouse's tale just wasn't gripping me. Somewhere around the middle of the book, though, my opinion changed. Maybe the story just took a bit to chug up to full speed, or maybe I was finally able to get out of the TV show mentality. The book, as always, is different than the movie. Sookie, the heroine, is charming, self-aware, and more than a little tongue in cheek. She also happens to be a telepathic waitress who works at a dive bar in Louisiana, a state that draws vampires to it like a moth to a flame. Couple that with Sookie's seemingly magnetic ability to bring trouble to her doorstep, and you end up with a rollicking good time. Dead Until Dark is a love story, mystery, and fantasy novel. It works extremely well on all fronts, except for maybe the love story portion. Sookie holds up her half of the relationship quite well, but Vampire Bill seems a little TOO cold and distant. He supposedly has these deep reserves of emotions and passion, but it's very hard to detect that. As a result, it sort of feels like Sookie is dating a robot. A super strong robot. Overall, a great story that is worth reading. Check them all out."
198,The Color Purple,0671727796,Alice Walker,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"I watched the movie Color Purple and really loved it and when I was required to read the book I kind of didn't want to read it because I already saw the movie, but I think the book helps you better understand the movie if there was some parts that you didn't understand, and I really loved the book almost as much as the movie. So I think everyone should read this book at lease once!"
198,The Color Purple,0671727796,Alice Walker,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Darsey_spudnick,"Probably one of the most impressive accomplishments of the Color Purple is the slow pace Alice Walker employed to lay out Celie's letters. With the exception of a few jolts and shocks, the letters unfold themselves leisurely, over many years, with a few shifts of focus and orientation and character, but overall the same in quality and tone. (Of course, as Celie's world expands, so does her world view and vocabulary, and the ""outside"" gradually becomes a part of her ever expanding horizon.) This makes The Color Purple, a rather mid-sized book by novelistic standards, feel much longer. The epistolary format of the novel, used to great effect, gives the sense that time is unfolding in a far greater sweep than the 295 pages in the paperback edition. But this is only one of the masterful elements of this novel. Walker has complete command of the art of writing a work such as this, and has fully realized its potential in nearly every area of writing: character development, plot, language, style, the presentation of conflict and its resolution. Reading the Color Purple, for those who write, provides ample opportunities to show how well a novel can work when a writer exercises complete command over her materials. Alice Walker, the master of wordsmithing."
198,The Color Purple,0671727796,Alice Walker,Barnes and Noble,4.4,HazelSR,"This epistolary novel is an endearing story about the life and heartache of Celie. This story shows the terrible treatment Celie received from the men in her life. It wasn't until she had an experience with a woman that she began to understand love and acceptance. The Color Purple has some plot elements that are perhaps far-fetched, but it adds to the overall beauty and point of the story. This is a fantastic novel that every student of American literature should read at least once."

And Then There Were None was an ¿edge of your seat¿ book. This page turner was a fantastic mystery book for kids, and adults. On a deserted island, Soldier Island, was where these ten mysterious tragedies took place. With an unknown man/women giving out invites to come to Soldier Island, but they¿re not ready for what they are getting into. With all ten criminals, yes criminals, put together it makes for an incredible mystery book. This incredible book is definitely first class material. On the kitchen table there were ten little glass figures, but when Anthony Marston died there was nine, and it keeps going down. Nobody can be so sure if people are telling the truth. Trusting your own instinct is huge in real life, and the book. The writing style of this book is a little challenging, but it makes you think. Once you starting thinking about everything that¿s going everything, everything falls into place. Anyone could read this book if they are up for a challenge, and a great mystery.

I've read it several times over the 15 years I've been aware of it. I enjoy the writing, the plot, and especially the use of the poem in the book. I tend to like this more than any of the books in one of her series. I think when authors write outside of their popular characters and environments, they tend to write better. I love it when I forget the ending and I am in just as much suspense as the first time I read it. In fact, I may be in more suspense because the story is a bit familiar, so I have that hint of nostalgia, but I still don't remember the secret! This is just such a fun book to read. I highly highly recommend it."

I have a tendancy to look at reviews before i purchase a book.  Random reviews before a book comes out skews the rating and is very annoying.  I really don't care what readers thought about an author's previous works.  I'm interested in the current selection I am buying now. If I want a history, I will look at previous works myself. Be fair to your readers and please consider this review process. There was one book I looked at awhile back that had 2,000 ratings by the authors fans before the book came.  And the book did not measure up."
201,"The Lost Symbol (Robert Langdon, #3)",0385504225,Dan Brown,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Oscar_Aguilar,"Yep, I just finished reading it and Mr. Brown's newest book, THE LOST SYMBOL, is a very worthy addition to your library. In ""The Lost Symbol,"" symbolist Robert Langdon is on a mission to find a Masonic pyramid containing a code that unlocks an ancient secret to ""unfathomable power."" It's a story of hidden history in the nation's capitol, with Masons the greatest puzzle of all.

Dan Brown uses the proven formula that brought him so much success in The Da Vinci Code. Robert Langdon, Harvard professor of symbology, once again sets his wits against a mysterious and murderous foe, solving puzzles of history, art and the occult, in the company of a beautiful female companion. They race against time to find a mysterious object and rescue a kidnapped friend. Along the way we hear all about arcane subjects as diverse as Freemasonry, symbology, noetics, and the architecture of Washington DC.

The pace of this novel is breathlessly fast, except for those moments when his characters turn into human textbooks, spouting background information. Although I found some of them fascinating, the reader can easily skim these sections without sacrificing much understanding of the plot. If his previous novels are any guide, this information may not be too reliable anyway!

Mal'akh, Langdon's evil foe is brilliant, formidable, and bizarre. He has all the frightening characteristics you could hope for in a villain. He makes a worthy opponent to Langdon and Katherine, in a true battle of wits.

The book features small, easily readable chapters and is a classic Brown-style page-turner. Six years of research and an amazing passion for writing is apparent from the first page to the last.

If you're a big Brown fan like me, you'll appreciate that I'm not going to divulge any spoilers to would-be readers. Check it out for yourself...you will not be disappointed.

Another outstanding book I finished this week that I strongly recommend is EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE 2.0 - So interesting...it rocked my world!"
201,"The Lost Symbol (Robert Langdon, #3)",0385504225,Dan Brown,Barnes and Noble,3.8,BookMarkML,"My Two Cents: I've noticed that some visitors are wondering how jeremy0u812 could have reviewed a book that isn't scheduled for strict-on-sale release until September 15. Well, it's fairly obvious to me that he has not actually read ""The Lost Symbol."" He reveals no specific plot points about the book, and his review simply appears to be a critique of Dan Brown's previous four novels and his expectations of this one. Additionally, there have been no galleys or advanced reader's copies issued from Knopf yet, nor are there likely to be any in the foreseeable future. I would suggest that everyone read jeremy0u812's review as such, and save final judgment for this specific book until it's available."
202,"Hush, Hush (Hush, Hush, #1)",1416989412,Becca Fitzpatrick,Barnes and Noble,4.4,mckenziet,"First off, the storyline. Many people have said this is too similar to Twilight. But c'mon people, this is about fallen angels, not vampires. Stop complaining and realize that the majority of paranormal YA fiction out there is incredibly similar. The plot of Hush, Hush was gorgeous. It seemed to be very well thought out and the pacing was perfect. Ms. Fitzpatrick kept feeding you tidbits of information at just the right time in order to keep the plot moving, but still suspenseful. The idea itself is little known to me; I haven't read any other books about fallen angels, so I was instantly intrigued. I found everything to be exactly as I would have wanted it. A dark, mysterious plot with plenty of wonderful characters.

Let me just say, the characters were divine. I'm so happy to have a strong female character instead of a spineless girl who can't do anything for herself *cough*Bella*cough*. Nora, although she falls for Patch, still has a sense of who she is and doesn't give up her entire life for him. Now let's talk about Patch. There's so much to say. At first I couldn't stand him and his arrogance, but I warmed up to him quickly. His attitude and charm grew on me. Plus, his innuendos in Biology had me smirking the entire time. I know, he's a bad boy, but how could you not be attracted to him? I mean seriously, I even got little flutters in my stomach at some of the things he said, and he's a fictional character. That says a lot about Becca Fitzpatrick's characterisation skills. Oh, and the chemistry between Nora and Patch is hotter than the sun. I could put an ice cube on Hush, Hush and it would melt.

Finally, the ending. This is the first in an incredibly long time...The ending was absolutely perfect! I literally swooned at the final line. I don't know how much will change from the ARC to the hardcover, but I hope not too much! I felt satisfied with what I had learned by the end of the book, but I was left with just enough of a cliffhanger that I can't wait to devour more of Becca's work. Her debut novel is by far my favorite book of 2009. Well done Becca on a perfectly devised novel that exudes darkness and sexual tension."
202,"Hush, Hush (Hush, Hush, #1)",1416989412,Becca Fitzpatrick,Barnes and Noble,4.4,JmWeidner,"I fell upon this book just by chance; read some of the reviews and said ""Heck why not"". The best 'Heck-why-not' decision I ever made! I read the online chapter and was hooked immediately. I ordered the book online but couldn't wait to read the rest, so I also ordered it on my BlackBerry. I stayed up until 4am reading every single page. Needless to say I had a wicked migraine the next day from the small print on my phone, but it was more than well worth it! Becca Fitzpatrick is a genius! Angels? A brilliant idea! There are so many twists and turns that you are able to keep up with. Becca pulls you into the story begging for more. Nora (one of the main caricatures) is not the whiny little girl like in another book and is strong willed but when Patch is close to her, making her pulse race. She looses all self control. Ha! What girl wouldn't with a guy like that! Becca physically describes the caricatures just enough, letting your mind fill in the blanks. Becca is focused in writing a excellent action packed book that is also filled with just the right amount of tense sensual and erotic moments (Written with class). If at all possible you would have to FORCE yourself to put this book down, I could not. This is a MUST read! I am Hoping and Praying Becca writes a sequel, since there are so many unanswered questions, again making you beg for more! I will urge my friends and all whom I know to read ""Hush Hush"", Facebook, Twitter...however I can promote it. It's a book of writing perfection! Excellent Work Becca Fitzpatrick.... I applaud you....*** Clap-Clap-Clap***"

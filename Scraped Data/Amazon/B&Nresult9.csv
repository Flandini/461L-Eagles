808,The Invention of Hugo Cabret,0439813786,Brian Selznick,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Book-Worm_x3,"I immensely enjoyed this book. I promise that you'll find yourself engaged in the story. It was really captivating. If you think it starts out slow or is confusing in the beginning, keep on reading! The story just gets better and better, with one suspenseful moment after another. The drawings in the book are absolutely MASTERPIECES. They really help you picture the story. I think that Brian Selznick has a very creative, imaginative mind for thinking up this story and making its illustrations. FIVE STARS! A GREAT READ! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
808,The Invention of Hugo Cabret,0439813786,Brian Selznick,Barnes and Noble,4.5,CRESTeacher,"This book was our school-wide (elementary) selection for January's Reading Month.  This amazing book was enjoyed by children from first through fifth grade - as well as their teachers and the staff who heard all the buzz and wanted to read it for themselves.  The book itself crosses the genres of graphic novel and historical fiction.  The author/illustrator does an amazing job of actually telling the story with pictures as well as text - not nearly having pictures that visual text for you.  And the intricacies of his drawings are exquisite. (I've used a document camera, so my students can get the full feel of each stroke).  The book is captivating.  The series of unknowns keep you glued to the book wanting and waiting for answers.  The complexity of the characters, the historical realism, the wonderment of little-known automatons, and the ability to have the reader feel each and every one of Hugo's emotions makes this book a journey worth taking.  My students even asked me to read it in place of recess!!!  The book is an easy and fairly quick read - almost half of its 584 pages are drawings.  It lends itself to curious discussions, predictions, and text connections.  There are even automaton paper models available online that go along with the story.  I plan on sharing this book in the coming years with each new group of students.  And I look forward to their enjoyment and wonderment."
809,Brave New World / Brave New World Revisited,0060776099,"Aldous Huxley, Christopher Hitchens",Barnes and Noble,4.1,KevinOlson,This book blew me away. It challenges the mind by making you step completely out of your comfort zone and demanding you to think in an abstract way.This propheic view of how our world may end up was all thought up by this brilliant author. Even his writing style makes you step out of your comfort zone. I found the entire book a very challenging and exciting read. This is seriously a must read.
809,Brave New World / Brave New World Revisited,0060776099,"Aldous Huxley, Christopher Hitchens",Barnes and Noble,4.1,KatherineNeff,"In the story, Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, the reader is exposed to a new world completely different from our own. Throughout the book we follow several characters, each with their own opinions on the society they live in. Strange ideas are excellently expressed through Mr. Huxely&rsquo;s writings although at parts, the reader is left slightly confused. Some of his ideas were to throw the entire society into a strict caste system, babies created through the injection of embryos, and then pre-programming them to look and think a certain way, and ideas of a family being utterly disgusting. Personally I believed this book to be extremely strange yet captivating. I thought Mr. Huxely&rsquo;s ideas that where expressed in Brave New World completely went against everything I&rsquo;ve been taught yet, was still interesting to see someone else&rsquo;s views on the world and how society could change into the new world."
809,Brave New World / Brave New World Revisited,0060776099,"Aldous Huxley, Christopher Hitchens",Barnes and Noble,4.1,AubiSka,"When I first heard of A Brave New World during my Freshman year of high school I immediately placed it on my running mental list of books to read. When the second semester of my Senior year rolled around and I was given the opportunity to read this novel in class I didn't hesitate to sign up for it.I definitely do not regret the time I spent reading and analyzing this novel as it has greatly enhanced the way that I view the workings of the world and society around me. At first glance Huxley's arguments about the human condition are fairly clear and straightforward, but as readers are taken deeper into the systems and inter workings of this strictly utopian society Huxley seems to offer up a multitude of poignant points concerning the state of the human condition. These points seem to transcend time as they remain relevant to society nearly one hundred years later. It is these reasons that make Aldous Huxley's A Brave New World a must read for any person ready to challenge themselves and the role they play in society."

I recomend this to everyone! It really is the greatest thing in the world. xD"
810,"Ouran High School Host Club, Vol. 1 (Ouran High School Host Club, #1)",1591169151,Bisco Hatori,Barnes and Noble,4.8,Rom,"This manga looks like a total chick thing, but I found it quite humorous. At first, when I saw all of the pretty boys and average art, I was going to stop reading after the first volume. And even after I read it, I was going to quit. But for some reason I checked out the second volume at the library. Frankly, it wowed me. The characters became deeper, the art improved as the series went on, until I had read the first 10 volumes already. With the new one out, and also the just as good anime, any manga fan should jump on the Ouran bandwagon. Don't think...just read."

It is not one of those creepy host clubs. I mean this host club's ""king"" is a totally innocent guy that is too stupid to figure out that he is in love with a girl. He thinks he is acting like her ""father"", and that is where his love comes from. Really cute! it has everything; comedy, romance, twincest(okay not the best thing to be pointing out when I'm trying to get you to read this.) Just read it please, you won't regret it! (Oh, and did I mention all the guys are incredibly cute?)"
811,The Good Girl,0778316556,Mary Kubica,Barnes and Noble,4.8,Anonymous,I thought this book was excellent!!!
811,The Good Girl,0778316556,Mary Kubica,Barnes and Noble,4.8,sneps,"Excellent Psychological Thriller!  The cover and book title are genius!!  Wow, I was thrown for one huge loop, when I reached the end of the book!  Mia is a socialite, who doesn&rsquo;t follow the norms within her family.  Her father, a prominent attorney, turned judge, is very much into appearances and will stop at nothing to make sure the family name stays untainted.  Mia&rsquo;s mom is the perfect wife, albeit on the outside, as she does her best to keep up appearances, too.  Mia has a sister, who follows the family rules and becomes an attorney herself.  Mia, on the other hand, struggles as a teenager and soon cuts herself off from the family, as she pursues art and becomes a teacher for the inner-city kids.

The story is told through flashbacks and present time, with the book addressing many issues: family secrets, why Mia is kidnapped, the relationship between Mia and her captor, Mia&rsquo;s relationships with her family, the relationship between Mia&rsquo;s parents, the justice system, and so much more.  It&rsquo;s a book that held my attention the whole time.  Mia tries to escape her captor, but overtime, experiences the Stockholm Syndrome.  What happens to Mia? What happens to the family and their public image? Who wanted Mia kidnapped? Those are just a few of the questions that will addressed in the book.  It&rsquo;s a book that will certainly engage the reader and offer some huge surprises along the way!"
811,The Good Girl,0778316556,Mary Kubica,Barnes and Noble,4.8,quaintinns,"Thank you to Harlequin MIRA and NetGalley for providing an ARC, in exchange for an honest review. 

A Killer Debut Novel! Mary Kubica&rsquo;s THE GOOD GIRL will keep you entranced from the first page to the last&mdash;where nothing is, as it appears. A world of four desperate, and complex characters, with more in common than they may think. 

THE GOOD GIRL takes readers from the vibrant city of Chicago, to a remote rustic cabin in the forest during the cold winter of Minnesota&mdash;where two people learn to trust one another. 

An intense and thought-provoking novel, ideal for book clubs and discussions. Readers will find themselves sympathizing with the two main characters, as their deepest feelings, struggles, and their dark pasts are uncovered&mdash; making for an intense page-turner mystery, you cannot put down.

In a desperate attempt for retribution, the stage is set for a flawless plan of attack&mdash;kidnapping; choices are made which will forever change the lives of those involved. When fate steps in&mdash;nothing will ever be the same. Readers will be drawn into this world of intense emotion&mdash;from the alluring front cover to the funky font, carrying out the theme of this chilling and engaging tale.

Told from different POV&rsquo;s (Eve, Gabe, Colin) &ndash;flashing back and forth, between before and after the kidnapping; building the suspense, keeping you on the edge of your seat, with a dramatic climatic surprise ending, when we hear from Mia- what an exciting ride! 

Meet the Dennett&rsquo;s, a family living in an elegant English Tudor home, along Chicago&rsquo;s North Shore, a suburb near Lake Michigan, north of the city. They are filthy rich&mdash; as in most wealthy homes, not everything is as it seems on the exterior. 

With a mix of complex human dynamics, and a riveting suspense thriller, fans of Jodi Picoult, Diane Chamberlain, Liane Moriarty, Miranda Beverly-Whittemore, Amy Hatvany, Ann Leary, Carla Buckley, T. Greenwood, Heather Gudenkauf, Gillian Flynn, Chevy Stevens, Julie Corbin, Lisa Gardner, Lisa Jackson, and Tess Gerritsen&mdash; will appreciate Kubica&rsquo;s unique writing style, as she eloquently pulls back the tough layers piece by piece, looking deep into the soul, mind, and hearts of each of her well-developed characters. (Found myself bookmarking so many pages, as too good!).

How does each person&rsquo;s past shape them into the person they are today? How does each of the character&rsquo;s lives change from the beginning of the book to then end? 

This dynamic novel is much more than a suspense thriller, a powerful novel&mdash;keeping readers thinking, long after the book ends and the lengths a person will go, in desperation, to protect their family. 

THE GOOD GIRL, hands down, a winner over Gone Girl. Highly recommend&mdash;looking forward to many more novels from this talented author (a sequel, perhaps)?"
812,"Fallen Too Far (Rosemary Beach, #1; Too Far, #1)",0000000000,Abbi Glines,Barnes and Noble,4.6,livelife,"Before I go too far can we just stare at that cover please. Ok. I'm ready now. Hmm. Maybe a couple more minutes.
I made a post on twitter about loving to write reviews that become love-fests. This review, my good people, happens to be a love-fest.
Fallen Too Far was thoroughly filling but I NEED MORE, no seriously. Abbi always delivers emotionally draining romances but this one really (really really) took hold of me. These characters are not perfect and this story is kind of crazy, and I absolutely loved this wild ride.
I used to read a lot of science fiction, a lot of post-apocalyptic, and a ton of fantasy. But, more and more I find myself looking for contemporary romances. Want to know why? Because they make me smile, laugh out loud, and live a little more. They fill up my heart and make me grin. One of my favorite authors happens to be this woman right here. Having read and loved all of Abbi's other books (especially Because of Low and Just for Now) I knew I would be buying this one on release day! I was looking forward to hearing Blaire's story and while I am not surprised that I loved it, I just can't believe how much it affected me when I turned the last page. My goodness Abbi Glines, can I keep you? K. Thanks.
Fallen Too Far is the first book I've read that after reading it I wanted a spin off novel that features the characters parents. This book takes drama too a new level. I think that going back to when Abe, Blaire's dad, was her age would be a story we all would enjoy.
This book will make you swoon. No, really.
Rush is this sexy, seductive, bad boy (the type that Abbi writes oh so well, she knows how to make us drool). He seriously made my heart jump, even when he wasn't being very nice. The sexual tension, intense chemistry, and forbidden feeling made me want more heat between these two opposites and Blaire's story kept me hooked. Abbi's one of those authors that I recommend to EVERYONE because I just know how sucked into her books I get and I think if more people got to experience the joy of reading books like hers they'd read more! So read more and read all of Abbi's books!
I loved Fallen Too Far! It has replaced my current favorite by Abbi Glines and is now in the lead. All of her books are great, most 5 stars for me, but there was just something raw about this one that really overtook me.
This is what I want for Christmas, Rush."
812,"Fallen Too Far (Rosemary Beach, #1; Too Far, #1)",0000000000,Abbi Glines,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"I loved it until as I got closer to the end, realized it was a series. Still very very good but i would have waited to read it once part two was out, I don't like to wait for a completion."
812,"Fallen Too Far (Rosemary Beach, #1; Too Far, #1)",0000000000,Abbi Glines,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,This book is for people who like sexy romance novels.
813,Landline,1250049377,Rainbow Rowell,Barnes and Noble,3.6,Anonymous,"In deciding whether to purchase a book, I often taken into account reviewers opinions of it.  One in particular has me concerned, since they mentioned ""fowl language"". 
Does this story involve poultry conversing? I don't speak chicken (or turkey or duck, for that matter).  
On the other hand if the person meant ""foul language"" then I'll give it a read. Swearing, when called for in a story, doesn't bother me."
813,Landline,1250049377,Rainbow Rowell,Barnes and Noble,3.6,KDH_Reviews,"Based solely on the blurb, I'm not sure I would have picked this book up if it had been written by anyone else. It's safe to say, though, that I'm down to read anything that Rainbow Rowell writes. Keeping up with the current trend, Landline was a wonderful book and I've yet to read anything disappointing by Rainbow.

Like everything else I've read by Rainbow, Landline was nearly impossible to put down. Forget everything else, I just want to sit and read for hours on end. That's pretty much what I did (much to my husband's irritation... hey, he can feed himself! I've seen him do it.) until I finished the book. The story flows effortlessly and before you know it, you're halfway through the book with no signs of stopping.

Not only does Rainbow write realistic characters (I love her dialogue most of all), but she writes an authentic love. Sometimes, in mature/longer relationships, we need to be reminded that we love our significant other. We need to be reminded of why we love them. It's not as if that love has disappeared or is gone forever. It's just that love has been buried by time and by life. Those things, no matter how much you love your significant other, affect your relationship. Landline is Georgie's story of finding her way back to her husband. No, it's not about finding that new passionate love. It's about rekindling that love with her husband. It's about saving her marriage.

I was thoroughly impressed with this book. It was even better than I imagined it to be.

You can read all of my reviews on my blog, KDH Reviews."

814,"Tempted (House of Night, #6)",1905654588,"P.C. Cast, Kristin Cast",Barnes and Noble,4.5,RowanJayne,"I have devoured this series and I waited in anxious anticipation for this book to come out. Sadly, I was very disappointed. This book drags, describing the play by play (not very exciting action) of every one over the course of about two days. Two very unimportant days! The story only began to get interesting in the last 10 pages. Clearly we are seeing commercialism at its best. They know they have us hooked to the series so the authors are stringing us along, stretching out the plot to maximize their book sales and hooking us at the end so that we will want to buy the next book. This is a bridge book, a filler for the real action that SHOULD take place in the next book. If I were you I would wait for the next installment to come out and then read the two books together. Otherwise, you will be just as disappointed as I."
814,"Tempted (House of Night, #6)",1905654588,"P.C. Cast, Kristin Cast",Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"Hey, I love the House of Night. It starts off with a normal popular girl, Zoey, who is ""dating"" the top of the line guy, Heath. But, when Zoey is Marked, she must return to the House of Night where she learns how to become a vampire. Sadly, in order to do that, she must leave her friends, mother, and possesed step-""loser"". (Ok. Let me explain. Zoey's father left them 3 years ago. Now, her mother is remarried to a religious pastor who is really messed up!!! He is totally controling Zoey's mother.) As she enters the House of Night, she soon learns that the reasoning behind her very sudden popularity isn't just because her ""mentor"" is a High Priestiss, but that she, even as a fledging, has even more power than the rest of the fledgings, and possbibly even more than some of the mentors, that have been there for a while. As Zoey becomes familiar with life at the House of Night, she makes some new friends, who now, and later, help her out, emencially. Zoey also might make something more than a friend. She is soon kicking Miss Popular, who is the leader of the Dark Daughters and Sons, out of her spot. Some think it is for her own popularity and some think it is because the leader, Aphroditie, is all wrong for the job, and is secretly evil, and on the side of either the humans, who think that keeping the fledgings locked up in houses so that they can't escape and get into trouble is just wrong, or on the side of... umm... you don't really find out WHAT they are. But, the one peoson that Zoey was supposed to be able to go to, is on the side of the ""new"" kind of vampyre.

815,No Country for Old Men,0375706674,Cormac McCarthy,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"Gory, Intense, Engrossing, and Beautiful. Those are the first words coming to mind when I hear No Country For Old Men by Cormac McCarthy. This novel is near perfect. Cormac&rsquo;s unique writing style suits the book entirely well and does the story itself justice. Aside from the superb writing, the story is entrancing and entertaining. The non-stop action and bizarre protagonists can keep even the smallest attention span intrigued. Lleweyn Moss finds millions of dollars in the desert and decides to keep it for himself. Little does he know that the most brilliant hit man in the entire south is right on his tail. Moss tries to keep his wife and the money safe at the same time, although has trouble juggling the two. We find Moss often times trying to find unique contortions and contraptions to hide the money but this brutal hit man isn&rsquo;t falling for any of it, killing almost everyone he comes in contact with in order to obtain his prize. Alongside This hit man is the entire Mexican drug cartel, striving to conceive this case of money. Moss has a run in with all of these people and continues to survive these intense scuffles but when he realizes he has to leave the sate is when he also realizes that his luck may be running out. Detective Bell, a long time Sherriff in a small county in Texas is on these men&rsquo;s tail also trying to get to the bottom of all the murders and guns fired in his once small, peaceful community. A true tail of cat and mouse that will have you biting your nails to the last flip of the page. Get ready for some late nights because it will be very hard for you to put down this book until you have turned all 350 pages of this seemingly easy read. 5 stars. Fantastic."
815,No Country for Old Men,0375706674,Cormac McCarthy,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,The story was a little odd but really a fun read.  McCarthy has such a unique writing style that challenges the reader but also adds to this short novel.
815,No Country for Old Men,0375706674,Cormac McCarthy,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,Sure this book isn't the typical book we are acustomed to reading. By that I refer to the style it is written and the way it speaks to you. Cormac does an excellent job at throwing you into a unknown world and making you believe it exists. I watched the film adaption of the book first and when i heard there was a book to it I bought it as soon as possible. Because as we all know film adaptions tend to skim on things. To my surprise the book was alot like the film minus the character development and more filling details the film did not provide. Plus the different ending. Interesting story to say the least.
816,"Wolf Hall (Thomas Cromwell, #1)",0007230206,Hilary Mantel,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Eadie,"I agree with the reviewers who say the writing style is difficult. I'll go one further and say its just atrocious. I consider myself a serious reader, but I'm on my second time trying to read it and just can't get into the story. Its difficult to figure out who the various 'he's' are. Half the time I can't figure out who is talking during a conversation. If I wasn't aware of the history and plot line, it would just be impossible. I'm sure there are other books that cover this material that are much better written and much more enjoyable to read. If it was a new plot line, it might be worth the effort. I'm glad I checked it out of the library."
816,"Wolf Hall (Thomas Cromwell, #1)",0007230206,Hilary Mantel,Barnes and Noble,3.7,BillR,"I almost put this book aside after the first chapter.  It was just too confusing.  Then I got my aged mind to accept that ""he"" always refers to Cromwell and it became a page-turner.  It is a fascinating look into the minds of Thomas Cromwell, Henry VIII, and various other players in the life of Henry VIII, the birth of the Anglican Church, the Protestant reformation, and the Renaissance in general.

If you read carefully, Wolf Hall also gives a lot of neat little tidbits about life in the sixteenth century; for instance, the convent washed their bed linens once a year.

I hope there will be a sequel that takes the life of Cromwell to its inevitable conclusion."
816,"Wolf Hall (Thomas Cromwell, #1)",0007230206,Hilary Mantel,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Milhous,"When I began reading this book I was worried some of the other reviews would be true, having already purchased the book, but fourtunately, they could not have been more wrong. They have issues with the writing style which could not be better, it is what makes the book so great and even thrilling, making of you a witness in every coversation. I do not see how a so-called ""serious reader"" would find it difficult; as an english-as-a-second-language-guy trust me, it is not. This is a ""quid pro quo"" kind of book, the more you give of your attention the more you recieve.
For those who question the timeline of the story and the ending I would say it is because it is not a history lesson what the autor is trying to give, but a lesson on human nature, portrayed through Cromwell, about how one can rise to any social status by his own merits, but not without tearing down others&#180; ambition in the process, for as Mantel says ""man is wolf to man"", thus giving a double meaning to what the title, Wolf Hall, stands for. The content, not just words, words, but words to digest."
817,"Howl's Moving Castle (Howl's Moving Castle, #1)",006441034X,Diana Wynne Jones,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,This is the best fantasy book I have ever read.  The characters are extremely likeable and not one-dimensional.  The humor included is great and I love the hilarious situations that Howl creates due to his vanity. The plot is engaging and Howl's Moving Castle is one of those books that you just can't put down. I have read this book over and over again and stil it fails to bore me.  Readers beware: Make sure that you give yourself time for it will most likely be that you finish this book in one sitting!
817,"Howl's Moving Castle (Howl's Moving Castle, #1)",006441034X,Diana Wynne Jones,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Mother-Daughter-Book-Club,"Sophie is sure that her life is meant to come to nothing, because where she lives the eldest child is always ill-fated. So when times get tough for her family she is content to stay home and work in the family hat shop while her two younger sisters go off to bright futures working in a bakery and learning magic. But when the Witch of the Waste comes into her shop one day and casts a spell on Sophie, making her appear old, she decides to set off into the wider world where she knows no one.

When her old bones become tired at the end of her first day of wandering, she finds herself at the edge of the wizard Howl's castle. The castle is enchanted; it moves and blows puffs of smoke constantly. Although Sophie is afraid of Howl because she heard he eats young girls' souls, in the guise of an old woman she thinks she will be safe. With thoughts of finding a warm fireside and a comfy chair, Sophie goes into the castle.

She finds Howl's assistant Michael, and his fire demon, Calcifer, but Howl is not in. As Sophie makes herself useful and becomes a part of the castle life, she begins to learn more and more about Howl, Calcifer and Michael. Gradually, as she gets to know them, they become like a second family to her. But can she keep Howl from being taken by the Witch of the Waste? And can she break a magical spell that binds Calcifer to Howl, so the spell on her can be broken as well?

Howl's Moving Castle brings up issues of creating family for yourself and seeing people for who they truly are, despite the masks they put up to keep others at a distance. It's about finding love and acceptance, and not being afraid to look for the magic in small moments. The castle itself is fascinating, with its door leading to different villages depending on which colored-button is facing down, its ability to move its location and its permanent window looking onto a sunny port town. Our mother-daughter book club members thought the ending felt a bit rushed, but otherwise we all enjoyed reading it and talking about Sophie, Howl and all the characters. I recommend it for book clubs with daughters aged 13 and up."
817,"Howl's Moving Castle (Howl's Moving Castle, #1)",006441034X,Diana Wynne Jones,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"Howl's moving castle is a wonderful book.  It's a quick, fun read, and the writing style of Diana Wynne Jones makes you feel like you're reading an old fairy tale and adds greatly to the charm of the story.  However, I don't suggest purchasing this story for the nook.  The e-book is filled with typos, which are few and far between when you start out, but then become so frequent that they're actually a distraction, and it doesn't help matters that the occasional word is missing.  All in all, the ebook feels as though it were carelessly put together, which I don't remember being the case with the plain old paperback edition.  It was a bit of a disappointment."

One of the few books without a plot that I was able to finish from beginning to end. Loved it."
819,Walden,0691096120,Henry David Thoreau,Barnes and Noble,3.7,jimmaclachlan on LibraryThing,"His whole 'back to nature' & simplistic look at life do have their appeal.  I don't subscribe to transcendentalism, but did find his musings broken up by the seasons to be interesting.  Like most philosophers, his view on life tends to ignore minor details (like reality) that don't fit into his worldview, but he does stay in the real world most of the time.  Luckily, he had some money, good health & people he could borrow from. I don't particularly like the man, though. His comments on marriage being ""a ball & chain"" for the man were absolutely offensive.  It's no wonder he never married or had kids.  His self-centered nature wouldn't allow for such distractions.  Even more offensive was the way he treated the axe he borrowed.  I don't care much for tool borrowers anyway, having had too many people borrow mine over the years & then 'treat them as if they were their own'. That means they beat them up or never return them.  That's exactly what Thoreau did, ruined a fine axe as if it was of no consequence.    An axe in 1845 was a useful & fairly expensive tool.  Generally, handles were handmade by the owner to their pattern.  Often the axe head was handmade by the local smith.  It required folding one piece of softer steel or iron to create the hole for the handle & then welding the ends back together.  Then a higher quality piece of steel was forged on to the blade end.  Different tempering was required for the two pieces.  Thoreau used his borrowed axe to both build his cabin & grub roots out with.  Usually only a very old axe was used for the latter since hitting rocks & dirt dulled it quickly & shortened its life.  After breaking the handle, he BURNED the old handle out of the head, which ruined any temper it had.  His ill-fitting replacement handle required him to soak it in water, which expands the wood to fit, but does so only briefly.  Once dry, the fit is even looser since the expanding wood fibers are crushed by the iron head.  Yuck!Anyway, this is why I was often distracted from his discourse on nature - I wanted to throttle him too often."

In fact, I'm sure that Thoreau would have loved the internet and been an avid blogger.  His rants are sometimes funny (the old have no useful advice for the young and thus should not give any) and sometimes tedious (the endless descriptions of the ice on the pond), but well worth the read.Incidentally, I had a college professor whose research was on good old Henry David.  He insisted that Thoreau was pronounced ""THOR-oh"", not ""thuh-ROE"".  The internet agrees, but I've never heard anyone actually say it that way."

When Mr. Darlington dies, the house is sold to an American gentleman who spends most of his time in America. He suggests to Stevens that he should take a few days off. Stevens decides to travel around England for 6 days. During this journey he spends most of his time to remember the good old days.
As I started reading this book I thought it might be a boring one, instead it turned out to be an emotional and heartbreaking journey for me as well. You will not find a lot of action in this book. I would say it's a sad story of what didn't happened. What really makes this book a great read is how well detailed Steven's personality, emotions and thoughts are described. Every sentence is simply perfect. Definitely must read for those who don't mind a slower pace."
820,The Remains of the Day,0571225381,Kazuo Ishiguro,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"The Remains of the Day by Kazuo   Ishiguro. Highly recommended.    It's difficult to believe how much Kazuo   Ishiguro packed into this short (by today's   standards), highly praised novel -- a   lifetime of work and relationships, the   realization of inescapable regret, and the   hope it is not too late to join the rest of   humanity.    Stevens is a butler for an English house   that is no longer great, nor is it owned by   the family for which it is named. His   postwar employer is, instead, an   American named Farraday; as a stranger   will point out to him later, 'An American?   Well, they're the only ones can afford it   now.' Farraday 'affords' Darlington Hall   by shutting much of the house down and   using a reduced staff, which Stevens can   understand, as the staff that would be   available would not be up to his own high   standards. When he receives a sad,   lonely letter from Darlington's former   housekeeper, Miss Kenton (now Mrs.   Benn), and later is told by Farraday that   he can borrow his employer's car for a   vacation on the road, he weighs the   opportunity and decides to take it for   'professional reasons' -- to see if he can   lure back the highly qualified Miss Kenton   to her former position. During the brief   journey, he spends much of his time   contemplating what 'dignity' in his   profession means -- and whether he lived   up to it. After a plethora of recollections   about the late Lord Darlington during the   prewar years and after his meeting with   Miss Kenton, Stevens comes to two great   understandings: he did not serve a great   man as he thought he had, and, in doing   so, he had missed a chance for love and   fulfillment. His devotion to Lord Darlington   has betrayed him, personally and   professionally. 'I can't even say I made   my own mistakes,' he laments. 'Really --   one has to say -- what dignity is there in   that?'    This revelation does not come quickly or   easily to either Stevens or the reader.   Each anecdote that Stevens recalls to   illustrate a point he wishes to make to   himself -- the definition of dignity, how he   upheld dignity by serving his employer   while his own father lay dying -- subtly   reveals how much he has shut himself   down emotionally in order to serve. With   each story, it becomes clearer that Lord   Darlingon is an easily manipulated man,   out of his league in world politics but   insistent on playing the role of   peacemaker -- even when it is no longer   appropriate or wise. When his friendship   with a woman leads him to firing two   Jewish maids, it foreshadows his   attempts to influence the British   government into appeasing Hitler and the   Nazis at any cost. He goes so far as to   say that the U.K. should perhaps follow   Germany's lead. 'Germany and Italy have   set their houses in order by acting . . . See   what strong leadership can do if it's   allowed to act. None of this universal   suffrage nonsense.' Stevens unwittingly   proves Lord Darlington's point for him --   he trusts Lord Darlington's judgment as   blindly as any German trusted Hitler's,   believing that 'people like him' are too   ignorant to make the decisions that must   be made and following the great man   contentedly -- and thus making a bad   decision.    When it comes to Miss Kenton, here too   his perception is kept in check by his   need for professionalism and dignity. His   repeated emphasis on their   'professional' relationship and his desire   to reconnect with her as a 'professional'   only highlight the extent to which he will   go to suppress his real feelings -- and   the very real possibilities that existed.    In life and love, Stevens realises he has   been avoiding both. In the end, however,   there is hope. After sending Miss Kenton   home, back to her husband, Stevens   turns to 'bantering'; that is, engaging with   people without resorting to   pre-programmed professional phrases   --in short, truly interacting with his fellow   humans.

I thought the beginning part of the book was decent, but really could not get into the personalities of the two main characters

The end of the book was rushed and the end was predictable and cheesy.  When I was reading the book, I thougt there was no way he would end the book like that, and to my disappointment he did.

""The Sense of an Ending"" will be discussed in English Lit 101 classes for years to come.

I am planning to continue with the series and I am interested how Kinsey Millhone will age.  Right now she is in the era of answering services (Google it) and $19.99 hotels. You have to read the book as a period piece if you are young. 
It is a really great mystery that had a lot of red herrings.  I was fooled more than once. There's one suspect telling complete lies, a few not ""telling the whole truth"", and a witness not willing to tell what they saw.  Kinsey has to sift though all that. I'm like a sponge believing all the half-truths and only thinking I knew the murderer by almost halfway through. I was way wrong.

This tends to happen when your English teacher quits at the end of every year. However, I still enjoy reading Oedipus Rex because of the way Sophocles presents the story. Sophocles does not tell the story chronologically, instead, the reader learns about Oedipus¿ past as he himself uncovers it. Plus, the irony throughout the tale, such as ¿none are as sick as I¿ {pg. 31}, makes it all the more enjoyable.However, mucking through the play alone, i.e. without your classmates reading the parts in the mocking and sarcastic voices teenagers are known for, can make it extremely boring and hard to get through.

Our schools don't teach much of Chinese history and Lisa's book educates us in the Chinese experience during the 20th century in Shanghai and also Los Angeles.  My mother grew up in LA and I remember her stories of the LA she remembered and Lisa captures the multi-national flavor of the era very well. Her story is a compelling tale following two sisters and their love and friendship that only sisters can have.  In Snow Flower and the Secret Fan, Lisa explores the relationships of the ""sworn sisters"". In Shanghai Girls, the sisters are modern and breaking away from the customs of old China, experiencing the bonds and rivalries of sisters, and coming to live and learn a new country and it's ideas. Sadly the story ends all too soon and we are left wanting more. I had the opportunity to ask Lisa about that and she also would like to see the story continue.  We are reading Shanghai Girls for our June book club and I am sure that everyone will love this book as much as we have Lisa See's other books. (Her first three mysteries are wonderful, too.  Modern day China and it's changes and challenges are the themes.)"
825,Shanghai Girls (Shanghai Girls #1),1400067111,Lisa See,Barnes and Noble,4,1Katherine1,"Shanghai Girls is a very good read. Sisters Pearl and May are modern and somewhat spoiled girls living in Shanghai in 1937. Working as ""beautiful girls"", they are hired by artists who paint their pictures for calendars and other advertisements. Although their parents don't approve of this work, Pearl and May are modern young women who enjoy the status and relative wealth these modeling jobs provide.
All this changes when the girls discover that their father has not only gambled away the family home and fortune, but their earned money as well. To get himself out of debt, their father has sold the girls as brides for two unknown men in America. In the background of all this, Japan has invaded China and is advancing on the city of Shanghai.
What results is a fascinating story of families torn apart, not just by circumstances but by lies as well. I thought Lisa See did a very good job making the past come to life with this book, just as she did in Snow Flower and the Secret Fan (I haven't read Peony in Love...yet). The conflict between the three generations is something everyone can relate too, as is the ignorance of youth. The culture shock the Chinese immigrants experienced in the novel really makes it clear how difficult it is to fit into a new (and sometimes hostile) society.
The one and only complaint I have about the book is that the story seems to go off the rails a bit at the very end. I almost felt like Ms.See wanted to end the book as abruptly and easily as possible, so she threw that in there. Fortunately, I found the rest of the book so charming and wonderful that the ending did not take away from my enjoyment of the book."

P.S. I Still Love You by Jenny Han
Book Two of the To All the Boys I've Loved Before series
Publisher: Simon &amp; Schuster Books for Young Readers
Publication Date: May 26, 2015
Rating: 4 stars
Source: Copy sent by the publisher




Summary (from Goodreads):




Lara Jean didn&rsquo;t expect to really fall for Peter.




She and Peter were just pretending. Except suddenly they weren&rsquo;t. Now Lara Jean is more confused than ever.




When another boy from her past returns to her life, Lara Jean&rsquo;s feelings for him return too. Can a girl be in love with two boys at once?




In this charming and heartfelt sequel to the New York Times bestseller To All the Boys I've Loved Before, we see first love through the eyes of the unforgettable Lara Jean. Love is never easy, but maybe that&rsquo;s part of what makes it so amazing.




What I Liked:




First, I'd like to express my deepest and most heartfelt thanks to Simon and Schuster, for sending me a hardcover copy of this book weeks before the publication date! I know proof copies exist but I am ever grateful for a copy in general. As with anything I receive from publishers... but especially with this book. I have been dying to read this book (I know I'm not the only one). Just a few more days, people!




Let me tell you, this book did not disappoint me. I saw one other person who had a copy, and she felt slightly disappointed by a certain element or two. I personally didn't feel the same way. Anyway, more on that later.




This book takes place pretty much where To All the Boys I've Loved Before left off. Lara Jean is planning on telling Peter how she really feels. And she does. They decide to really be a couple, and make a new contract with sweet things that honestly made my heart swell. More then half the book is focused on Lara Jean and Peter's relationship. But Lara Jean sees how much Genevieve still leans on Peter, and how Peter still runs to her side, despite them being exes and now friends. When one of the boys from Lara Jean's letters writes back, Lara Jean and him reconnect. Peter is pulling away, and this boy is reappearing. Might Lara Jean be in love with both of them?




Let me start by saying that I will get to the romance in a second. I will say for now, to ease everyone's minds, that it is NOT AS BAD AS IT SOUNDS. I promise. This is coming from me, the hater of love triangles. Everybody take a deep breath.




I'll start with family. I absolutely love the strong sense of family that Han weaves through this duology. Lara Jean is close with her older sister Margot and her younger sister Kitty, and their father. I feel like Lara Jean and Kitty's relationship is really spotlighted in this book, though Margot is definitely a part as well. We can clearly see how the family dynamic works, and how strongly this family is. It's so cute to see Kitty meddle in their father's personal life, pushing him to start dating. Lara Jean wants to see her father happy (not just content), her sister at peace with Josh, and her little sister, well, her little is pretty much happy with messing with everyone's business.




More than half this book is spent focused on Lara Jean and Peter. They are dating for real. They have their ups and downs. A big part of this book is a big part of today's society - someone took a video of Lara Jean and Peter doing certain things in a hot tub in To All the Boys I've Loved Before. It goes viral around the school. I love that Han included this in the book and made it such a big deal, because this is a really important theme of the book. The internet is forever, BUT, you as a girl shouldn't feel bad for kissing a guy. There's a huge double standard that exists, and Han really spearheads this double standard. Everyone tells Lara Jean to be more careful, but no one tells Peter anything. Peter is the one to speak out and people listen, whereas Lara Jean is labeled with certain hurtful terms. This part of the book hurt me to read, but it's so, so important in general.




Lara Jean and Peter have other problems too, like Peter keeps hanging out with Genevieve. He's texting her and talking to her and hanging out with her. But it's clear that he's not dating her or involved with her. But to Lara Jean, just the fact that he's around Genevieve bother her. Do you blame her? Personally, if I were in Lara Jean's shoes, I'd be doing the jealous non-trusting routine too. Genevieve is kind of cruel. I liked that Han had this type of drama in the book - it's real and it's legitimate and every girl feels this way about her man's exes. You can't tell me you didn't/don't. Lara Jean's insecurities are real and called for, in my opinion.




Okay. Let's talk romance. I keep saying that more than half the book is spent on Lara Jean and Peter. They are happy. They are together. They have issues but they talk it out. More than HALF the book, guys. The synopsis implies love triangle but...when I got to around page 150 and saw no hint of Boy #2, I KNEW. I just KNEW that the insinuated love triangle wasn't going to be a real thing. Or it wasn't going to be THAT BAD. Call it faith.




Anyway, Boy #2 is really that - Boy #2. He's one of the five boys that Lara Jean wrote a letter too. I expected this, for Boy #2 to be one of the five boys we haven't already met. Trust me, he wasn't much of a &quot;threat&quot;. He stood no chance. Lara Jean is one of those people that falls easily, and she was at a vulnerable spot at this point in time when he enters. Boy #2 had no chance, in my opinion. There really was no &quot;choosing&quot; in the end because there was no choice.




I hope that eases everyone's consciences without spoiling things. The &quot;choice&quot; really is made at the very end of the book, but it's not really a choice. What I'm saying is, it's not as bad as the synopsis makes it seem. Really, it's not. I think Simon and Schuster (or Han) wanted to drum up anticipation and play readers by shoving a love triangle down our throats via the synopsis. Trust me, it's not that bad. 




I love the progression of Lara Jean and Peter's relationship. They are sweet together, they are fire together, they are ice together. They learn to trust one another while they hurt each other. They learn to be careful around one another while they take care of one another. Lara Jean does a fair deal of growing up throughout this duology, and in the end, she does what's right for her.




I love seeing her life come together! Remember in the To All the Boys I've Loved Before how Margot would always be pushing Lara Jean to do extra school things and classes and test prep and whatnot? Lara Jean starts to do a fun extracurricular type of activity that really makes her grow as a person. It's great to see her have a life outside of her family, school, and Peter.




I also loved seeing how Han portrays the idea of sex. Many YA books feature sex, or characters having sex, etc. Lara Jean isn't ready to have sex. She thinks about it a lot, but she knows that she isn't ready. When that video hits the virtual world and everyone thinks she and Peter had sex, she freaks out. I like the message here about sex here - it's okay to not be ready. It's okay not to be having sex at this age. It's okay to say no to a boy. If he cares, he'll want it, but he'll wait. Good for you, Peter. Good for you, Lara Jean, for knowing what you what and sticking to it. I think it's great that this perspective on sex is shown - it's your choice. A lot of YA books have the female protagonist having sex at some point in the series. In this series, Lara Jean isn't ready, and that is okay. It really is.




Anyway. In the end, I was really, really pleased with this book. I think there was a good amount of drama, romance, family, and general societal themes that made this book highly authentic and highly enjoyable. This book really captures a teenage/young adult relationship, from the jealousy to overthinking text messages to low blow insults/jabs. Han really did a wonderful job with this duology, and while I'm not a contemporary fan, I can safely say that this is one of my favorite YA contemporary series.




What I Did Not Like:




I think the only thing that I didn't like is something that very well may have been out of the author's control (or perhaps she wrote it herself, who knows) - the synopsis. The &quot;love triangle&quot; really is NOT THAT BAD. I even hesitate to call it such. I think it was a media thing, to build the anticipation. I'm not trying to spoil things but... readers will be happy with this book. Promise.




Would I Recommend It:




I would highly recommend this book and To All the Boys I've Loved Before. I can guarantee you I'll be rereading this series over and over, as well as pushing it on everyone. I'm not even a YA contemporary fan! You saw this whole week how I struggled with contemporary. I read five YA contemporary novels in a row and this one is the only one I actually enjoyed enough to say that I would recommend it. So. There's that.




Rating:




4 stars. A solid 4 stars! I didn't love it as much as I loved To All the Boys I've Loved Before, but this book (and series) is definitely worth buying! Even if you're not a fan of YA contemporary (like me), you'll enjoy the series. And this one, this conclusion to the duology, was well worth the wait! Despite the horribly written synopsis. Definitely give this book a chance, guys!"

Anyway, this sequel has been by far one of the most realistic sequels that was ever written. 
I have always shipped the Lara Jean-Peter love team so when I read about the synopsis involving another boy from Lara Jean's past, I was thrilled and excited to see how Peter would react. 

However, as I read the book, I felt a little bored not until I got to the middle part. The love triangle in the first parts of the book was actually on Gen because Boy#2 only appeared only after the half of the book.
I kind of wished that he appeared earlier so there was more jealousy for Peter because it felt really unfair for Lara Jean to always see Peter and Gen hanging out and Gen still being the mean girl that she is. 
There were also so much conflicts that needed resolutions and the ending was kind of abrupt. 

I would be less disappointed if there would be another book just to close and resolve the conflicts the second book offered. 

I would love more moments of Peter-Lara Jean, the Song sisters, Margot's lovelife, their dad's lovelife, Gen and Peter's settlement, Josh's friendship with Lara Jean, Boy#2 and Lara Jean's friendship, and many more. 
I'll always be thankful to Jenny Han for giving us so much swoon-worthy moments and lovable characters where you could relate too. I could say that these two books will always be one of the best YA novels for me. &lt;3 

BOOK # 3 PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!! =)"
828,"Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood (Persepolis, #1)",037571457X,"Marjane Satrapi, Mattias Ripa",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Cougar_H,"I thought the book Persepolis was a pretty good book. Some of the things learned reading this book, is when the bombing sirens would go off the unusual places they would hide. For example, some of the places they hid were in their basements or they would just lay on the ground and cover their heads. For school all the girls were required to wear a veil and a long black robe. The people were not allowed to show any of their hair and had to get rid of their facial hair. I was surprised at their rules,  they couldn't have board games and were not allowed to have curtains on their windows. Also they were not allowed to listen to music or have posters. I sure would not like those rules and neither did they. 
     One thing that was confusing to me was when the chapters would end and a new one would begin, the subject would change to something completely different. It was hard to follow the book sometimes. My favorite part of the book was the ending. When the daughter is at the airport and she is leaving her family she turns around to say one last goodbye and her mom has fainted. She says to herself "" I should have just kept walking"", she said this because this made her sad that her family will miss her and she will miss them. 
     I would recommend this book because it is a book that keeps you interested. It was a very unpredictable book too and there were some twists and turns that makes you want to keep reading. I am looking forward to reading the second book."

Since Persepolis is a graphic text, it encourages multiples literacies (different types of reading and thinking) and inferential thinking by requiring students to read images as well as text.  In a world that is so dominated with images, teaching kids how to read images is growing increasingly important.

Furthermore, given the tensions in the Middle East right now, Satrapi does a beautiful job on humanizing the Iranian people that most Westerners simply know from 20-sec. newsclips.  It also offers historical, yet anecdotal, information on the Iran-Iraq War, politics in the Middle East, gender roles and women's rights.  And to top it all off, Satrapi is funny!!!  This book is just too full of teachable moments to pass up in the classroom."
828,"Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood (Persepolis, #1)",037571457X,"Marjane Satrapi, Mattias Ripa",Barnes and Noble,4.3,sandiek,"In Persepolis, Marjane Satrapi uses the graphic novel format to share her life story with readers.  Satrapi grew up in Iran during the years that the Shah lost power and the Fundamentalist Muslims became the government authority.

Satrapi was raised in a modern family that valued education and modern life.  Her parents were part of the revolution that forced the Shah from power.  They were shocked, however, when the ultra-religous government that took over soon made the freedoms they were used to and expected illegal.  No longer could women dress as they pleased; they were instead forced to wear the veil.  No longer could the Iranian people travel freely; the borders were closed for over three years, and even when reopened, passports were almost impossible to obtain.  No longer could one count on an education; the universities were closed for over two years.

Darker items were to follow.  There were 3000 political prisoners under the Shah, but there were 300,000 political prisoners under the new regime.  Satrapi's family had both relatives and friends that were imprisoned, tortured and some were even executed.  Then the government got involved in a war with Iraqi.  Bombings were common, and over a million people were killed.

Satrapi's use of the graphic format is a perfect match to the story of a young girl whose life changes so dramatically and who tries to make sense of the things happening around her with a child's understanding.  Satrapi ended up being educated outside of Iran in her teen years and later, and chose a graphic artist's career.  This book was a perfect match for her talent, and her memoir is chilling.  To see freedoms taken away gradually is difficult, and when one looks up and sees where the normality markers have moved to, it is eye-opening.  This book is recommended to all readers who care about world events, and those who enjoy memoirs."
829,A Room with a View,1420925431,E.M. Forster,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,"A Room With A View is a novel not only about the journey to find true love, but also about the difficult decisions one is faced with when one must decide to either listen to the expectations of others, or their own heart.  In this novel the main character, Lucy takes a trip to Italy with her cousin, and upon her arrival meets the Emerson¿s.  Lucy belonging to the upper class of society thinks she could never have an attraction to someone of the lower class, like the Emerson¿s. Love was something Lucy was hoping to find in Italy, but as soon as she arrived back to her home in England she promptly became engaged to Cecil, a man of the same social class as her. Lucy soon realizes that she is not truly in love with Cecil, and discovers that she is in love with George Emerson. Everyone Lucy knows expects her to marry someone wealthy and proper, like Cecil, but instead of listening to what others expect of her, Lucy listens to her heart, and allows herself to be in love with George.  Throughout Lucy¿s journey to find true love Forster conveys the message that others expectations cannot guide one to the path of love, only one¿s heart can. I recommend this book to anyone who struggles when faced with making the decision of following others expectations, or following their heart. This novel will teach its readers that what one truly desires is the only escape to genuine happiness."
829,A Room with a View,1420925431,E.M. Forster,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Themomof7,"If you have a difficult time understanding older English, this book will be a challenge. However, stick with it. It has humorous characters who delight and intrigue. Lucy Honeychurch is a force to be reckoned with when she finally throws off the nonsense of society. This is a story that takes a young girl through a self-understanding process and gives the reader food-for-thought. If you can ponder her decisions and understand her choices, you will find a great heroine within the pages of this story. Lucy seems feeble and weak, but by the end, you find her quite the opposite. Watching her transformation is wonderful and well worth the time."
829,A Room with a View,1420925431,E.M. Forster,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Guest,"The union of love between two people cannot be wholly   attained unless each partner first establishes their own,   independent identity. E. M. Forster¿s witty and coming of   age novel articulated this message through the novel   centering on Lucy Honeychurch¿s dilemma of pursuing   love and independence in a confined social and mental   environment. Mr. Emerson is a brave character that   displays Forster¿s thoughts towards new-age liberalism   and ultimately influences Lucy to find her own   independent identity. The message Forster communicated   in the novel created a timeless and beautiful love story for   all generations. Anyone who picks up this novel will find it   to be a great read."
830,The DUFF: Designated Ugly Fat Friend,0316084239,Kody Keplinger,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Tiger_Holland,"Bianca Piper's two best friends are gorgeous, but that's never bothered her. She's brilliant, cynical, and wiser than her buddies and they all support and care for each other, so the prettiness contrast isn't an issue until resident ladies' man Wesley Rush tells her to her face that's she's their DUFF: Designated Ugly Fat Friend. Wesley also has the nerve to tell Bianca that by showing sensitivity and deigning to talk with her, he's upping his chances of seeing some action with her friends. Needless to say, Bianca shuts him down, and rightly so, but as her home situation gets sadder and more complicated she finds herself drowning her sorrow with none other than Wesley ""Womanizer"" Rush. 

I was delighted by the portrayal of Bianca's relationship with her friends. At first, I was of the opinion that Bianca was basically doing them a favor by hanging out with them, since she's intelligent and practical, but in short order I saw that Casey and Jessica weren't at all ditzy. They balance Bianca's snarky view on life, and together they achieve a balanced group dynamic that's very believable and fun to read. I could see myself reading a book with either Casey or Jessica as the protagonist; that's how fleshed-out the characters were. 

I wish Wesley had gotten more development. At first, Wesley came off as a wonderfully calculating and shrewd jerk, and I was ready to see him humbled and looking forward to plenty of battles of wits between him and Bianca. Unfortunately, the terrific tension and verbal sparring in the early chapters seems to wane with time. Wesley seems most like a 3-dimensional character in the first thirty or so pages, then when he and Bianca fall into an enemies-with-benefits arrangement, he loses some vitality. Yes, plenty of attempts are made to give him a more rounded character--his love for his little sister, standing up for Bianca, showing some intellect regarding an essay assignment--but the initial spark was gone. Maybe I just want my YA couples to move more slowly? 

One other thing I had trouble with was the way Bianca kept using Wesley. She loathes him partly because he's an egomaniac, but mainly because he's wildly promiscuous. The trouble is, she thinks that his low moral standards make it perfectly okay for her to use him whenever she happens to need a distraction. Now don't get me wrong, he's totally happy and content with being treated this way, but I couldn't help but be disappointed that Bianca followed the ""he's a total skank, so I can treat him any way I want, and it's fine"" philosophy. 

On the upside, The DUFF explores lots of important ideas about self-respect and self-worth. I love the assertion that basically everyone has felt like the duff of their group before--every girl (and guy) feels like they're lacking at one time or another. It's very empowering and encouraging. 

Bianca's narrative voice is funny, sharp, and smart, and with the exception of the difficulties with Wesley, I really enjoyed the book. I'll definitely be looking forward to future writings from Kody Keplinger."

831,Lock and Key,067001088X,Sarah Dessen,Barnes and Noble,4.4,dedicated_reader,This book was very good. I have read all of Sarah Dessen's books and the way she ties everything together in the end is sensational. You cannot read this book during a busy time- aka finals... That would be a big mistake. This is definitely a must read!!
831,Lock and Key,067001088X,Sarah Dessen,Barnes and Noble,4.4,dholland08,"I loved Lock and Key. Not only is it tied with The Truth About Forever as my favorite Sarah Dessen book, it is now one of my favorite books ever. The story is narrated by Ruby. She's been living in a run-down farmhouse after her mother abandoned her. Although her living conditions are far from easy, Ruby thinks she's doing just fine. Then her living alone as a minor is discovered, and Ruby is shipped off to live with Cora, the older sister she hasn't seen in ten years. Cora's world is perfect, she has a huge house in an exclusive neighborhood, a good career as lawyer, and a nice, wealthy husband. Suddenly Ruby is surrounded by everything she never had and thought she could never have; a private school, new clothes, and a second chance. But for some reason she doesn't want any of it. Sarah Dessen's characters make this book great. There's Jamie, Ruby's optimistic brother-in-law; Nate the popular boy next door and Harriet, a jewelry making workaholic. Then there's Ruby herself. She is so layered, hiding truths about her life even from herself. Is she just a misfit in her new, priveleged life or is she something more? You'll have to read Sarah Dessen's exquisitely crafted novel to find out."
831,Lock and Key,067001088X,Sarah Dessen,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"Ruby is having a hard time adjusting to her new life. She's not used to not having to worry about the bare necessities such as food and clothing. She's not accustomed to all the money. She's not used to living with her family. It wasn't too long ago that Ruby's mother left her for good. No one besides Ruby knew, and she was planning to keep it that way until she turned eighteen and was legally an adult. But someone found out, and now Ruby has to live with her sister and brother-in-law. But Ruby doesn't know how to deal with this new lifestyle, or with her overly friendly neighbor Nate. Ruby doesn't like depending on anyone or letting anyone really get to know her. But Nate might be more like her than she thinks. Sarah Dessen is one of my favorite authors of all time, and she does not disappoint with Lock and Key. I really love how Sarah Dessen can really capture the emotions people like Ruby feel, the stubborn independence and loneliness. She weaves a beautiful story of the healing of a girl and the healing she returns. Like all of Sarah Dessen's novels, Lock and Key is truly amazing. I found myself glued to the pages, not able to turn them fast enough. There is a lot of symbolism in this novel, mostly stemming from the title, and this is what makes the story so brilliant. On one hand, there is Ruby who is reluctant to unlock her past to anyone but ends up letting Nate into her heart. On the other, Nate refuses to let Ruby unlock him. The struggles of both Ruby and Nate are so similar to some of the struggles many teens face today, although in different perspectives, and I really appreciated how realistic it was. I highly recommend Lock and Key along with all of Sarah Dessen's other novels, including The Truth about Forever, This Lullaby, and Just Listen. Fans of Deb Caletti will also enjoy this novel, as well as teens everywhere. Great read..."

833,The Chamber,0385339666,John Grisham,Barnes and Noble,4,carlosmock,"I was a John Grisham fan. My personal favorite is his first book, A Time to Kill, later adapted into a successful film.The Chamber is John Grisham's best-selling book - ever. From beginning to end, it is an engrossing read. The reader flies through the 600+ pages, as Grisham paints a picture of a family wrecked by the sinful racism of the father.The Chamber tells about a fictional character named Sam Cayhall, condemned to the gas chamber because of a crime he committed in the late 1960's against a Jewish lawyer. Cayhall was an accomplice in setting a bomb that destroyed the lawyer's office and unintentionally killed the lawyer's two twin boys. With just a month before his execution date, Cayhall's grandson, a fresh, young lawyer named Adam Hall, arrives on the scene to save the day.The Chamber forces the reader to wrestle with the idea of the death penalty. The crimes are described in horrific detail, and we later discover that Cayhall was guilty of even more egregious sins than the one for which the government wants to execute him.If you skip the book and decide to rent the movie, be aware. The movie isn't half as good as the book. (I know everyone always says this, but trust me on this one.)This is, in my opinion Grisham's last work worth reading.I gradually tired of Grisham's writing. His approach has become overly familiar and formulaic. Many of his books read as if the author was planning for an immediate movie adaptation of the current novel (the Stephen King Movie of the Week syndrome) while he was writing. As a consequence, I simply stopped reading his subsequent books. Grisham can produce page turning prose with the best of them, but after awhile the repetition became monotonous for me. After reading six of his books, I stopped cold.It was not so much a case that Grisham was not entertaining, he was, but as a reader I had the sense of having been there and done that. Some gifted authors have a talent for writing books that always seem to be fresh and new, even when employing the same set of characters, while others seem to fall into a predictable, if profitable rut. Someday, I may check out another Grisham book to see if I was incorrect in my original assessment."""""
833,The Chamber,0385339666,John Grisham,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"The Chamber is by a long shot one of the greatest books in the series of novels written by John Grisham.  It's only match so far is the Street Lawyer, as they both look beyond the court system in an extraordinary plot to problems which occur in our everyday lives.  This is a masterpiece and an enjoyment to read.  Anyone who finds this boring has a low mentality, so don't be swayed by any of the less intelligent 1 or 2 star reviews."
833,The Chamber,0385339666,John Grisham,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"If 'The Chamber' is the first Grisham novel you ever read, you might become suddenly obssessed with law relating fiction.  I know I did.  'The Chamber' is so exciting, you should hook yourself up to a heart moniter and a breathing machine just to be sure you don't die of excitement, and I almost wrote the Surgeon General to carry a warning on the cover.  The six hundred seem like three hundred, and should take you about that long"

Harold Fry is truly a lovable character that you continue to learn more about and become closer to as the story unfolds. The beautiful language used by the author is so easy to read and I found myself going back and re-reading passages that I had to let sink in again. Joyce is truly profound in so much of this book.

I cannot recommend this novel enough - it is a story of love, loss, triumph, perseverance and so much more. It is hard for me to believe that this is a debut novel and I wish Rachel Joyce much success and hope that many readers have the privilege of enjoying this novel as much as I did."

It's not that some of it isn't clearly intriguing, but it gets tiring, and quite frankly, not a lot HAPPENS in this novel to pick it up. When something DOES happen, it can be really quite spectacular--Card crafts these moments extraordinarily well--and just for these moments 'Xenocide' may be worth the read, but be prepared think about alot more in reading this novel."
838,"Xenocide (Ender's Saga, #3)",0312861877,Orson Scott Card,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"This book is a good book. It picks up straight where ""Speaker for the Dead"" left off. I must stress, the book is rather confusing and meaningless if you haven't read the previous books. To be fair, it is a bit slow at times and may be confusing if you don't pay attention to the book and the concepts explained/proposed. Another thing is that you must keep an open mind to that which Card writes. He expresses philosophical concepts that may seem impossible and probably are. But that's okay, it's fiction. If you want science fiction that fits all of the perameters of known science you should give up searching for it. You will never find it. The point of science fiction is to surpass the limits of all known science and to stretch to the farthest corners of your imagination. Who cares if his fiction is unlikely? Was not Columbus's idea that the Earth was rounded rejected by many?                                                       -Demosthenes"
838,"Xenocide (Ender's Saga, #3)",0312861877,Orson Scott Card,Barnes and Noble,4.1,PennameJW,"This book is the third in a series of 4. But it is arguable that there are more and there are but here not the main 4. In the series there is Enders Game, Speaker for the dead (3000 years after the first one), Xenocide, Children of the mind. There ones only going to be three but the last one were too long and he has to split it into two. In no doubt in my mind that he is my favorite author.
 I loved it, although I do like all of the books in this is my favorite. It is my favorite because it has the most in-depth of them all. The reason it does it because it has the main climax of all the stories. So in this they haft to find out how to fix their main problems. How they do this is what makes it so great. How he can think of all this and make it believable is what makes him such an amazing.
	Even thought this book was written many years ago I think that it has such advance technology in it that it could be believable today. Not crap that would be pointless and stupid he puts things in his books that would make seams and would be applicable today. 
But I do haft to argue that people wouldn't like this because it is very confusing and it makes you think a lot and people just like simple books. That's what makes it so great in my opinion because it is a challenge to me and it gets me to use my imagination in ways that I never have before. So to cap it all I loved this book and I hope you will too after you read all the first books otherwise it will make no sense."

It may seem a little confusing to a few people, but it's just a great play! Shakespeare's characters are very entertaining. Shylock's a VERY talkative, vengeful Jew while Portia is an intelligent princess who can easily beat Bassanio with her wit!

The reason I am writing this review, however, is to blast the inept editor and publisher of the eBook version. I purchased this book the very first day I got my Nook, and have been reading it steadily since. I should say that I've been SUFFERING through it. It is replete with misspelled words, some of which are complete gibberish. In some cases, entire sections of text have been moved, thus breaking the narrative completely.

The publisher of this abortion should refund the money of everyone who made the mistake of downloading the eBook, and then either fix the damned thing or else pass it off to someone who will do this great book the simple justice of publishing it CORRECTLY.

Yes, I recognize the irony in my complaining about misspelled words in a post likely containing many of my own, but I'm not asking anyone to pay me to perform a professional service. The blockheads who published SHOGUN without having even read it WERE."

I was pretty bummed, and I was upset that they would release an ebook in such an unreadable state, so I decided to call customer service and give them a piece of my mind!

They told me that they have a proof-reading team, and that every time they get a complaint about one of their ebooks they proof-read it and fix it, so she said that this book is likely fixed by now.  I purchased it, and am now 100 pages in and haven't seen a single typo yet!

I almost let all of these negative reviews scare me off, but I am glad I didn't."
840,"Sh??gun (Asian Saga, #1)",0440178002,James Clavell,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Genghis_Sean,"I'm not exaggerating when I say that this is possibly the best book I've ever read. Not every book Clavell has written is great, but with Shogun and Taipan, he was not far off perfection. The novel first drew my attention when my parents were watching the miniseries back in 1980. Though only a kid myself, I was permitted to watch it along with them and found it fascinating. It took me two months, but I first read the 1200 page book as a sixth grader and have reread it every two years since.

Shogun is the story of an Englishman shipwrecked on the shores of feudal Japan. John Blackthorne lands full of European and Christian prejudices and is bewildered by the alien culture he encounters, where peasants aren't given names and samurai ritually disembowel themselves when they fail their lords. He lands in the province of Yoshi Toronaga Minowara, a general who has warred for 30 years without ever losing a battle. 

It is not long before he is swept up in the politics of the country, a great chess game for power wherein his ship and the guns it bears become a piece in the game. The emperor died a decade earlier leaving his child son behind. Before dying, he appointed a Council of Regents headed by Toronaga to keep the peace following his death until young Yaemon comes of age. However, the council has begun to fracture as many fear Toronaga, who has never known defeat. They believe he intends to undermine the council, seize power for himself, and become Shogun, the sole military ruler of all Japan.

Replete with samurai and courtesans, war and assassination, ninja and espionage, politics and maneuver for power, it's a must-read, particularly for those who love historical fiction. I've never in my life read a better book."

841,"Lover Awakened (Black Dagger Brotherhood, #3)",0451219368,J.R. Ward,Barnes and Noble,4.7,WolfeeTX,"This book is about one of Ms. Ward's Black-Dagger Brotherhood Warriors, Zhadist... The warrior who is considered ""Psycho"", trying to kill as many Lessers as he can, to protect the humans and the Vampires from the Omega and his followers.   The warrior who denies his love for his twin, his fellow warriors and for the lady he thinks deserves a ""Male of Worth""...   I highly recommend this book...but, have a box of tissues handy (just in case).  *****  (5 Stars)!!"
842,"A Court of Thorns and Roses (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #1)",1619634449,Sarah J. Maas,Barnes and Noble,4.7,Book_Sniffers_Anonymous,"I am brand new to Maas&rsquo; work so I went into this with no expectations as to what to expect. I came out a huge fan. The world she crated was spectacular. There were intricate characters that left me rooting for even the questionable ones. Not to mention that storyline&hellip; that storyline was so much more than I was expecting. This isn&rsquo;t just a story of how beauty met the beast. Oh no, this went above and way beyond that.

I finished this book a few hours before writing my review and I was still reeling from it. I don&rsquo;t even know what to say that would portray all the emotions that this book contains without giving away all the surprises within. Because after all, the surprises are what make the book amazing. I honestly was expecting just a love story. A story where Feyre (Fay-rah) is captured and forced to live with Tamlin in the Fae realm. Where Feyre is supposed to fall in love with Tamlin to break his curse and they live happily ever after. But oh no, Maas doesn&rsquo;t just give you that story. She throws so much into the mix that you are left wondering how you will ever be able to read another book after you&rsquo;ve finished.

Okay, let&rsquo;s start with the characters. Feyre is one of those strong-willed heroines. Her family is so pour that if it weren&rsquo;t for Feyre going out into the dangerous woods to hunt, they would all starve to death. However, she isn&rsquo;t revered as their savior. Her sister looks down upon her and her father doesn&rsquo;t even acknowledge her. So when Feyre kills a faerie while on a hunt, she unknowingly signs her fate away to Tamlin. He gives her two choices, die now or go back to his world and live the rest of her life there. Obviously, we know which one she chooses, otherwise this would have been one very shot story. Her courage throughout the entire book was astounding. She never balked at anything. She always held her head high and wasn&rsquo;t afraid to stand up for herself. The book is solely in her point of view. So I&rsquo;m glad that she was as strong of a character as she was.

Tamlin is of course the beast. When he shows up to take Feyre away he shows up in his beast form which is mix between a bear body, feline grace, and a wolf&rsquo;s head. He&rsquo;s a shape-shifter and can change between his animal and human form. However, when in human form his curse shows. His court (the autumn court) are stuck wearing masquerade masks. They were at a ball when they were all cursed and are now unable to take the masks off. They also have very limited magical powers. Long story short, Tamlin needs Feyre to fall in love with him in order to break the curse. Just like with the Beast, Tamlin is unsure of Feyre. He needs coaxing from his right hand man in order to converse with Feyre. And just like Beast, he sometimes says or does something wrong. I love that the author still managed to bring the essence of Beast through to her character.

There&rsquo;s not just Tamlin and Feyre though. There&rsquo;s a bunch of characters in this story that bring it all together. Some that leave you questioning their motives, their loyalty, and sometimes their sanity. I like that the story didn&rsquo;t consist of Feyre and Tamlin in his estate but incorporated the Fae world throughout the entire book.

I think one thing that I absolutely LOVED about this book was all the gruesome parts. Like I said, this is so much more than just a romance story. The romance is only the half of it. There was fighting, and not just throwing punches but the breaking of bones, the tearing out throats with your bare teeth. Oh my goodness there were so many amazingly written horrifying scenes in this book that left me on the edge of my seat with my heart in my throat. My minds reeling just thinking about them all.

Yeah, if you can&rsquo;t tell by now, I loved this book&hellip; and then some. This is one of those stories that will stick with me for a long time. I love that it doesn&rsquo;t end on a cliffhanger. I was really expecting it to since that seems to be a trend lately but the author kind of wrapped up the story for us. I have no idea where she will go with it next but I will definitely be signing up for the rest of the series."

SO CAPTIVATING, I just flew thru it but now I wish I would have spaced it out some bc it ended way to soon. I'll definitely be having withdrawals, ugh, but maybe I'll at least dream about it tonight."
842,"A Court of Thorns and Roses (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #1)",1619634449,Sarah J. Maas,Barnes and Noble,4.7,NestledInABookBlog,"Overwhelmingly beautiful, heartbreaking, and emotional. A Court of Thorns and Roses is nothing short of perfection.

This book is 100% outside of my interests and comfort zone. At the over the top and not so gentle urging of my friends, I took a chance on it. After all, I figured my reading New Year&rsquo;s resolution was to step out of the box and I&rsquo;d yet to even try to do that halfway through the year so&hellip; it was time.

To say that I am completely shocked at how much I loved this book would be a dramatic understatement. I never expected to be so utterly drawn in, so captivated by a story so unique and so far from what I&rsquo;m used to. 

Sarah J. Maas is an artist, with a talent and imagination so blindly dazzling that I will struggle to move on from it. She completely obliterated all of my pre-conceived notions and everything I thought I knew about fantasy.

{&rdquo;I love you. Thorns and all.&rdquo;}

I was on the edge of my seat through most of the book; unable to put it down and heartbroken when I was forced to. Feyre and Tamlin&rsquo;s love story is epic and timeless. They were captivating and I fell in love with their story as they fell in love with each other.

The world and history that Sarah J. Maas creates is awe-inspiring. She writes in a way that you can see, smell, hear, taste, and feel everything as if you were part of the fictional world spun by her wicked imagination. This brilliant take on Beauty and the Beast (which also happens to be my favorite Disney movie!) is one of my favorite books of the year! One of my favorite books ever! I am so blown away.

The one lesson that I learned from this book is that any love story, if told really well, bridges the gap of time, space, and reality. Sarah created a breathtaking masterpiece in this book and I am all but dying for the next book! Please, if you ever take my advice on anything, take it on this. Read this book. Break out of your comfort zone, try something new, buy this book, and read it immediately. I promise your eyes will be opened to a whole new world. And you will love every second of it."

But when I started reading Chicka Chicka Boom Boom to him, he would sit in my lap as long as I read it.  Soon he was getting the book, bringing it to me and climbing in my lap on   his own.  Any book that can get MY son that excited about reading is a winner.      Plus, this is one of the only BABY books that I can have fun reading.

846,Animal Farm / 1984,0151010269,"George Orwell, Christopher Hitchens",Barnes and Noble,4.3,the_empress,"These are good, classic books, and I liked the idea of getting them both at once. Unfortunately, this eBook version contains an unacceptable number of typos. I give it 3 stars for the novels but 0.5 stars for this version."
846,Animal Farm / 1984,0151010269,"George Orwell, Christopher Hitchens",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Alleycat13,"Wow, if anything is closest to a prediction of where the world is headed this is it! Its so cram packed with psychological themes that most people are afraid to even approach that its a Psychologist/Philosopher's dream. Its very good for opening ones eyes to the world around you and seeing where we can end up if we stand idly by. I recommend this to anyone who has the intellect to understand and appreciate good literature ^_^"
846,Animal Farm / 1984,0151010269,"George Orwell, Christopher Hitchens",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"Animal Farm was a lot better of a book then what I expected when I had to read it. While many may think its just about crazy animals or human stupidity they are wrong in the highest sense. The plot of Animal Farm is truly exceptional and is actually drawn from real world happenings, specifically the fall of the Soviet Union. In the beginning of Animal Farm, the animals hold a secret meeting after their drunken owner Mr.Jones goes to bed. This meeting is spearheaded by Old Major, an old boar and leader of the animals, whom is on the brink of death. Old Major tells the other animals of a vision he has had, where animals roam free to do whatever the want with out the influence of human beings. The morning right after Old Majors speech he dies, which is a wake up call to the animals, especially two young boars, Snowball and Napoleon. Together along with the other animals they work to make Old Majors dream in to a reality. Compared to many of the other books I have read this one stands out by far. One reason for this is the integration of real life events and happenings, which in this case is the fall of Soviet Russia, by combining it into a more easily understandable story that still conveys the message of the events. Also George Orwell's ability to take real people such as Joseph Stalin and Adolf Hitler and real events like world war two and the fall of the Soviet Union and transform them in to an animal and an event in the story. This book can grasp your interest very quickly and keep it until the end, by the events that unfold and the unexpected twists and turns that are an essential part of the book. This is a quality in a book that I have not seen in a long time. If a book isn't interesting then most people will quickly put it down and not bother to read on, but Animal Farm steals your attention right away and holds on to it right through the end of the novel. So if your looking for an interesting read, that combines some of the most notable events in history into a more understandable form then Animal Farm is the book for you. Read it and I promise you will be more than glad you did. This book is a ten on my chart!"
847,"The Deep End of the Ocean (Cappadora Family, #1)",0140286276,Jacquelyn Mitchard,Barnes and Noble,3.9,SuperMomof4,"""The Deep End of the Ocean"" is a moving account of a family coming to grips with the nightmare of losing a child.  The writing is strong and the plot, although somewhat predictable, keeps moving so that the pages keep turning.  The book is thought-provoking and quite emotional.  The book contains some sexual content and profanity.  I enjoyed the book although it was a difficult subject.  It is not a light read, but certainly worthwhile and I would recommend it to others."
847,"The Deep End of the Ocean (Cappadora Family, #1)",0140286276,Jacquelyn Mitchard,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"I cannot even bring myself to take it to the used book store.

847,"The Deep End of the Ocean (Cappadora Family, #1)",0140286276,Jacquelyn Mitchard,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"Book Review    I give Deep End of The Ocean by Jaclyn Mitchard three stars.  Two negative aspects that I saw in this book where, how Mitchard portrayed the mother Beth.  Also at certain parts of the novel it drags on and on and it bores you after while.  One of the positive aspects I saw in this book is that it was realistic because any mother could loose their child in an instant as Beth did. Also even though the book dragged on at times it still was easy to follow.  I recommend this book to all mothers, so they can try to understand the pain that Beth went through losing her child for many years.  All mothers could relate to Beth¿s pain."
848,The Bonesetter's Daughter,0345457374,Amy Tan,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"Not her best book but overall pretty good. My one star is because the book is $18.99, and the paperback is $7.99. I have to pay an extra $11 to basically rent a book and never completely own it or be able to let someone else read my copy? That is ridiculous. If the paperback is $7.99, the ebook should be no more than that, and probably less."
848,The Bonesetter's Daughter,0345457374,Amy Tan,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"It's a somewhat slow start (the first 2-3 chapters) but once it gets going it really swept me away. I thought it was even better than The Joy Luck Club, even though I liked that too. 

This story is divided into three parts, the first and third told in present day (for the book, in the 90s) from American-born Ruth's perspective. The middle part is told from her mother's perspective as a child, teen, and then young adult in China. It portrays the complexities of familial relationships, particularly mother-daughter, and the trials of love, loss, etc. I was transported through the characters' many sorrows. Tan is able to make the characters come fully to life and the plot was both believable and surprising. I highly recommend this book."
848,The Bonesetter's Daughter,0345457374,Amy Tan,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Mavis1129,"I listened to this on audio and really liked it.  The Joy Luck Club is more popular than this book and I don't know why.  This one was way better. 

Overview:
Ruth has always had a complex relationship with her mother.  Through her childhood, she struggled to understand her mother's previous life in China and the marriage she had before her mother married her father.  When her mother starts showing signs that she's losing her memory and even starts fabricating the truth, Ruth becomes really concerned.  She looks to the pages her mother wrote in Chinese and had given her years ago.  Ruth had set them aside meaning to translate them but never got around to it.  Now, she realizes it is her mother's life story and the importance it plays now that her mother doesn't know what is truth anymore.  What she finds out, once it's translated, is the heartbreaking tale of the family secret that haunts her mother and the family curse she believes to exist.  After reading the translated pages, Ruth looks back to the past and is able to see her mother with new eyes.  Growing up she was annoyed and embarrassed by her mother's strange ways but is now able to see that her mother was just tormented by the ghost of her own mother.

What's really sad is when it says that Ruth shoves her mother's pages in a drawer after failing at translating it herself.  Every year her mother would ask if she finished translating it until she eventually stopped asking, saying that Ruth was too busy for her.  When you realize the importance of the papers, it's that much more heartbreaking to know how her mother must have felt.  Later, in her mother's story, you see the same thing happening when she refuses to read papers given to her, resulting in tragic consequences."
849,"Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging (Confessions of Georgia Nicolson, #1)",0060288140,Louise Rennison,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"Angus, Thongs, and Full Frontal Snogging is the diary of 14 year old Georgia Nicolson and her adventures throughout a full year. You are introduced to her younger sister Libby, wild cat Angus, best friend Jes, first boyfriend the professional snogger, and her one true love Robbie. Before school starts Georgia begins experimenting with makeup and decides that her eyebrows are the problem. She shaves her eyebrows off. These are the kind of problems deals with all year. Life is hard enough without eyebrows but after they grow back the boy problems start.     When I started reading this book I noticed that I would be flipping page after page and not even thinking about it. Before I knew it the book was over. I made the mistake of starting the book during 3rd period English which would have been fine but I couldn't put it down until lunch. I guess I will never know what happened during History and French on that day. Not only was Angus, Thongs, and Full Frontal Snogging  easy to read it was extemely enjoyable. I would be reading during class or during rehersal and literally laugh out loud. Angus was one of those character that made me laugh. Can you imagine a wild cat that is bigger than a poodle and who loves to frighten the neighbor's dog?    The writing style of Louise Rennison is witty and conversational. When I was reading this book I would actually be reading it in my head in a british accent. I think everyone can relate to Georgia. This book isn't a fairy tale made up of unbelieveable plots and happily ever after. Georgia is real, she often says how much she hates her life and I don't know a teenager who doesn't think that every other week. When reading this book I would think to myself I know how that feels. I truely believe that most teenage girls can find a new favorite book in Angus, Thongs, and Full Frontal Snogging."
849,"Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging (Confessions of Georgia Nicolson, #1)",0060288140,Louise Rennison,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,"I never believe when somone says that a book is a laugh out loud book, but this one really was. I had to make sure I read it only in certain places because I was laughing out loud. I'm in my early 20's and I can't put it down. I remember all those awkward situations. this book is one of the funniest things I have ever read."
849,"Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging (Confessions of Georgia Nicolson, #1)",0060288140,Louise Rennison,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Dani_Burrage,"Angus, Thongs and Full Frontal Snogging, Louise Rennison's laugh out loud novel, follows the ups and downs of a British teen's experience growing up through her every day journal entries. Like most of us, Georgia has a goal. And that goal is to meet the man of her dreams and live to be fabbity fab fab. Too bad nothing can be fabulous in Georgia's life. 

To start off, she is missing her eyebrows thanks to a shaving accident. And that only accentuates her much too large nose. And she cannot manage to have a large nose because she has to impress her crush The Sex God and steal him away from his wet girlfriend. And to top things off she has to live with a cat the size of a Labrador, the Olds (A.K.A her parents) and her little sister who is far from the average kindergartener. Georgia's life is not hard. It's pure entertainment. 

Teenage girls will die laughing over Georiga's tell all diary, whether it be she is whining about her miserable love life or the fact that her best friend thinks she looks like an alien. No matter what something is happening to Georgia. Ninety percent of the time it is not pleasant. 

Unlike most teen books, which center on friendship and all the great things about growing up, Louise Rennison writes to make readers laugh. And the miserably embarrassing parts of high school are always the funniest; at least to other people. That's why Rennision decided to write Georgia's life based off her own teen experiences. In fact, most of the bizarre characters and happenings in the novel aren't one hundred percent fictional. 

Though Rennison does a great job depicting teenage woes, actual plot and morals get lost in the humor and randomness. The only thing the reader learns by the end of the book that there was really no story to tell besides the fact that Georgia is hilariously funny.  

That's what makes this novel the perfect relaxed read for girls. There aren't any big or fancy words and the closest thing to thinking required is deciphering some of the British slang terms that come up here and there. And best of all, Rennison was sure to leave out any adult sounding preaching. 

Rennison's writing is true to life, the good parts and the bad ones. She never condones teen girls making out or smoking cigarettes. Rather, she finds the humor in it and gives the reader a glimpse of how silly teenage worries and ""struggles"" really can be. 

All in all, Angus, Thongs and Full Frontal Snogging is a fun read for teen girls over the age of fourteen. Sexual themes are present in the book and its best if younger readers ages 12-14 wait to read this novel.

I just gotta know what happens to them. This is a must read!

Once you start reading, you are constantly worrying about these characters.  V.C. Andrews took a risk with this book because it talks about things most people avoid.  She did an excellent job! Interesting read."
851,"Flowers in the Attic (Dollanganger, #1)",0743496310,V.C. Andrews,Barnes and Noble,4.5,XXXOOOBookwormOOOXXX,"The story revolves around the Dollanganger family. One evening Christopher Dollanganger dies in a car crash and his family, consisting of his wife and four children, must go back and live with their family in Foxworth Hall. Both Christopher and his wife, Corrine, grew up in this mansion. It is because of their incestuous marriage that they were both banished from their home and their family.
Wanting to recapture her father's adoration and love, Corrine comes home and hides her children, so that she may inherit his vast fortune. She asks her mother to watch over the children, who are confined to the North wing of the house. They are not allowed to leave this area and can only go up into the attic. Soon their mother pretty much abandons them and leaves them to rot in the attic while she lives her life without them. Their evil grandmother does everything in her power to make them feel as bad, horrible, and dirty as possible, wanting to punish them for what their parents had done nearly 20 years prior. Soon the children discover that they are slowly being poisoned and why they are trying to be killed.
This book is an excellent tale of deceit, love, hate, pain, and triumph.  The melodramatic prose might turn some people off, but Andrews has a real skill for creating mood and an engrossing read and that is as much of a legitimate talent as the high-brow literary giants I also love. I'm 29 but I'll never remember when I first picked up this book at 12 and couldn't stop reading and felt like someone connected with all my confusion. V.C. Andrews is like Judy Blume if she was crazy, perverted, and obsessed with sexual deviancy! God I miss that woman.  Some of the details are hard for an adult reader to accept as credible, but why do you think we loved this books as teenagers? Because many teenage girls-and I stress girls, because I most of what Andrews' covers doesn't apply to boys-go through all the things Cathy goes through-testing sexual attractiveness for the first time, looking at our changing bodies in the mirror, first period, challenging parental authority,the trauma of first sexual experiences, etc. All those changes are scary and weird. Of course the added elements are demented and perverse but that just adds to the fun. Every emotion I have ever felt was presented to me at the turn of each page. While reading and feeling so disgusted and angry with the grandmother, i was beyond ANGRY with the mother. She is one of the most selfish and self-centered characters EVER....a despicable human being. I hate her with a passion. Definitely going to be reading more from this author and series!"

It discusses tough issues, so I suggest an adult near by to ask questions.  Be prepared for racism and people acting in ways that you don't agree with.  In the end all people in this book learn something from each other which helps them grow - which I think will happen to the reader who thinks and asks questions while he or she reads this book."

I know I have read this book in the past, but I did not remember much about it; I read it after Stargirl and found Maniac Magee less compelling.I liked it a lot more this time. Maniac is an orphan with superhero-like athletic abilities. He settles in with an aunt and uncle but soon wanders away to find a new home with a black family. At the time of this story, a white boy living with a black family is a difficult situation. Maniac becomes the target of both blacks and whites who find the situation intolerable. Finally, Maniac gives into pressure and wanders away from the black family to live with an old black man. Maniac teaches the old man to read and the man helps Maniac hone his baseball skills.

The need to be something, anything, other than what they are."

855,Twelfth Night,0743482778,William Shakespeare,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"I used this copy of Twelfth Night for my Shakespeare class, and it was far superior to the edition the professor had chosen. The text is printed on the right page and notes appear on the left. The trade paperback provides room for a decent sized font and room for notes in the margins. The notes themselves are invaluable to understanding the play, and the extended notes and commentary in the back (illustrations of the stage, notes on modernization of text...) are interesting as well as informative. This rivals texts that are twice the price."
855,Twelfth Night,0743482778,William Shakespeare,Barnes and Noble,3.9,ArneyT,"Every B&N Shakespeare has been awesome and this is no exception. Nice, clear text, helpful notations, and interesting articles. Highly recommended."

understand Shakespeare's language. This book is absolutely wonderful. I most definitely recommend 
this for students in high school through college. Maybe middle school though it's a very small chance they
will understand the concept and comedy. As always, Twelfth Night is underrated by critics. A true classic!!"
856,"Gathering Blue (The Giver, #2)",0385732562,Lois Lowry,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Amy-la,"Pain. Thats all Kira feels. Pain from her crippled leg, pain from her mother's death, and pain from being deemed useless in a community where physical prowess means everything. Lois Lowry brings us yet another riveting tale about the future. But this time it is different. Where as The Giver shows a future where there is no color and no difference, Gathering Blue is a world full of color. It is about dealing with trying to find a place in a society that does not want you, that can't use you. This village appears to bring out the worst of human nature. The villages are full of greed and jealousy and hate, and they have no place, not in the village and not in their hearts, for the newly orphaned Kira, who can't do the hard labor in a village that demands for it. As Lois Lowry weaves the story of Kira, our young heroine, we are swept along on a journey of self-discovery. And it is one that will lead us to find the dark secretes that lurk in human nature. Gathering Blue is an unforgettable story, one that will leave you breathless and wanting for more."
856,"Gathering Blue (The Giver, #2)",0385732562,Lois Lowry,Barnes and Noble,4.2,booksatruestory,"Gathering Blue is about an orphan girl, Kira, with a gift of dyeing and weaving threads. The community and the characters are completely different from The Giver. The story feels nothing like The Giver until you get to the end, where Lois Lowry ties the two books together in a beautiful way.  And yes, you get to find out at the end what happens to Jonas. I liked contrasting this society with that of Jonas&rsquo;s from The Giver. In some ways this community is worse off because there is poverty, hunger and no education. But in some ways this community is better than Jonas&rsquo;s because there is color, personality, deep family love, and some freedom. Not a lot of freedom, but some.

I loved the naming system in this world. I found it very creative. How many syllables your name has is a status of how old they are. I loved how beautiful the writing was. Lois Lowry is a master and making you turn the pages. With every page you get a sense of something else being not quite right (as she said at her signing) and that&rsquo;s what kept me glued to the story. She goes into a lot of depth of what the main character is thinking and feeling which I loved. The story sucked me in all the way until the ambiguous ending. I have a feeling she likes those&hellip;  She said at her signing that she likes leaving things up to the imagination.  If the ending is done right, I say that I have to agree.  And Lois knows how to end it just right. I found this book to be another powerful story from her about family and love."

This book is NOT like Hunger Games, nor like Ender's Game. When a book is written within a specific genre, often times the concepts are similar. Doesn't neccesarily make the books similar. This book was great! I highly enioyed it, and I'm 50. The characters were sympathetic, most likeable. Concept was original and engrossing. Mr. Brown, keep up the good work, and thanks for sharing.

858,"Red Rising (Red Rising, #1)",0345539788,Pierce Brown,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Anonymous,"If you cannot read about rape, gore, teens murdering, feces  this is not for you. Minimal roamance, much world building (both of Mars and of the game). Plot twists were mostly not predictable, but some cliche. A lot of action, survival, and adventure."
858,"Red Rising (Red Rising, #1)",0345539788,Pierce Brown,Barnes and Noble,4.4,tpolen,"This was unlike any dystopian novel I've ever read - even the setting was unique - Mars.  As with most dystopians, a lot is at stake and in the case of Red Rising, it's freedom of people in a social system categorized by colors - and I don't mean race.  Gold is at the top of the food chain and red, the color of soil on Mars, is at the bottom.

Darrow pulled me in from page one.  He begins as a hard-working guy who loves his wife and family and just wants to provide for them, but by the end of the book, his naive view of the world has changed and he's undergone tremendous growth.  I can't wait to see what he does in the sequel.

I have to admit, somewhere around the early middle of the book I began to lose interest and felt like the plot strayed a little, but before long, I couldn't put it down.  The last half was completely testosterone-filled, which isn't a bad thing for someone who doesn't read chick-lit, and I was totally captivated.  The cast of characters also included some strong women who could hold their own in physical challenges against men.  With the actions and level of intelligence of some characters in this book, at times I found it difficult to believe they were teenagers, but they are a product of their environment and did what they needed to survive.

I would recommend this book to any dystopian lovers and it would be a great read for age 15+ teenage boys (girls too, but we all know it's harder to get a book in front of the guys).

This review is based on a digital copy from the publisher through NetGalley."
859,"The Way of Shadows (Night Angel, #1)",0316033677,Brent Weeks,Barnes and Noble,4.5,BluHawk,"""Way of Shadows"" has to be one of the most well written fantasy books I have ever read. It transports you into a 'shadowed' world with some extremely dynamic and interesting characters. Although a good portion of this book was difficult for me to stomach, I feel that Weeks was trying to emphasize that you can't fully appreciate the light unless you have experienced darkeness. I was extremely impressed by this novel, and I can't wait to read what Weeks comes out with next.

I think fans of Salvatore's Artemis Entreri will enjoy the characters, and fans of Stephen King will enjoy the writing style."
859,"The Way of Shadows (Night Angel, #1)",0316033677,Brent Weeks,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Enma,"This series is one of the few sets of books I can read over and over again and not get tired of it. It lacks the usual five paragraphs explaining some random lady's coat nor does it linger on a single detail. Its fast paced and it almost feels as if you're there, watching it like a movie rather than simply reading it. It introduced different ideas, wraps up nicely, and leaves space for future stories. Some of it was predictable and it included some cliches' but not necessarily in an irritating way. It was more believable than the norm. All and all these are the best books I have read in a while and compared to what I usually read the change in pace is a relief. It is not a story for the light of heart."
859,"The Way of Shadows (Night Angel, #1)",0316033677,Brent Weeks,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Wade-Black,"Way of Shadows is heartfelt without being corny, and philosophical without being preachy.  The way Brent Weeks switches plot streams keeps the reader constantly engaged and on edge.  The book reads like a gritty and modern R- rated superhero legend.  The devil is in the way Weeks details the arts of war and assassination.  Way of Shadows does not lack for action or an intelligent story that forces the reader to rock back on his/her heels with each new twist.  Totally addicting and satisfying."
860,"The Bean Trees (Greer Family, #1)",0812474945,Barbara Kingsolver,Barnes and Noble,4.1,GeorgeEllington,"I admit, I am no great fan of modern American literature. Apart from Ernest Hemingway, Philip Roth, and Raymond Carver, I hardly touch the stuff. I prefer a foreign setting, not to mention a different genre. And with that bias, I approached Barbara Kingsolver at long last, and found The Bean Trees to be remarkably compelling. The story of Taylor Greer, on a journey across the country, heading nowhere in particular, simply seeking to escape her dreary life. Only to be handed a life she could not have expected when a baby is thrust into her car and left in her care. Kingsolver has created characters who seem quite far from me, lives and experiences distinct from my own. Yet somehow she manages to make me care about these people. She can weave a tale around a superficially simplistic setting, a deceptively banal event - and inject it with such meaning, such feeling. Cheers to you, Ms. Kingsolver. I look forward to reading more of your works."
860,"The Bean Trees (Greer Family, #1)",0812474945,Barbara Kingsolver,Barnes and Noble,4.1,chloesmomst,"I was not hooked from the begining. But in a few brief turns of the pages the characters came to life. Bean Trees is a bit quirky. The characters are strange and the locations even stranger but the reader begins to care about the characters. Taylor seems to be floating thru life accepting whatever comes to her but as the story progresses she finds herself and her voice. The relation with LouAnn deepens and LouAnn deepens as a person. The caring of Mattie for the people you know and those you don't is unique. And the relation between Esteven and Esperanza to each other and Mattie and Taylor and Turtle is beautiful and deep.
This is not the best book I have ever read but it is worth reading from beginning to end."

861,"Walking Disaster (Beautiful, #2)",1476712980,Jamie McGuire,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"I cannot say I don't like this book because I really loved Beautiful Disaster. Unfortunately, I make the mistake of re-reading BD the day before this book's release, and it is as if the author simply went through her manuscript and changed the expository writing from Abby's view to Travis' and all of the dialogue is the exact same, with the exception of a few new scenes involving Travis in which Abby was not a part. This being said, the book is as good as the first...because it is the same story, but it will be far more entertaining if you don't refresh yourself on the original..."
861,"Walking Disaster (Beautiful, #2)",1476712980,Jamie McGuire,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Laurab68,"Walking Disaster is Jamie McGuire's follow up to her wildly successful self-published novel Beautiful Disaster. Only this time we get into Travis &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Maddox's head. This book is so anticipated that we who got early copies were lip-locked. Embargoed if you will.




I think Jamie had a good idea, but the I feel the construction failed. We know the story. We know what happens and seeing it from Travis' point of view doesn't give us insight into him at all. Yeah, we get a few bit of his interaction with his mom, but really how many three year old's remember vividly what happened? Losing a mom is momentous, but when you're three you don't quite understand the significance of it all. So I found the prologue, first chapter a bit weird.




I wanted more Travis-centric scenes with people other than Abby. I know what happens, I know they fall in love, fight, break up, are a beautiful disaster of a couple. But I wanted to see more of what was making Travis tick. There were a few scenes with him and Shepley that were nice. One scene with his dad that I wish there were more of. I really would've liked to have seen more interaction with his dad and brothers.




The saving grace of this book for me was the last chapter and the epilogue. Jamie could've written a book on that alone and I would've been extremely happy because she went into uncharted territories that is brought up in BD, but skimmed over. It was a very interesting twist and I thoroughly enjoyed that. Makes me wonder if she'll continue on with that story line? I think it would work.




For me, 3/4 of the book didn't work. I was bored, wondering when I was going to learn something new. But alas, it never came.




People will gobble it up and love it. I know that I'll be in the minority on this. I just wish there was more fresh material."
862,"Words of Radiance (The Stormlight Archive, #2)",0765326361,Brandon Sanderson,Barnes and Noble,4.8,Anonymous,"I like to think myself a well rounded reader. That said, this book absolutely blew me away. First, I like George R R Martin much as the next person but there's something droll about reading a series that portrays ""real"" human nature. I like to think not everyone is an incestous, gluttonous, traitorous, etceterous individual who lives specifically in the moral gray area. If you are considering reading this before the first novel in this series (I have no idea why you do that) STOP and read it. This installment is like a shardbearer fighting a bridgeman or a rhysadium racing a horse. I really loved this book. If you were afraid that Words of Radiance wouldn't measure up have no fear.

The story continues in the shattered plains and beyond as the book picks up precisely where WOK left off. Like the previous novel, there is a flashback sequence which involves the manipulative, sometimes infuriating Shallan. It is difficult to even skim a summary because there is just so much information in this book, not to mention pages. 

I will say that I feared that there would be too many questions, not enough answers, too many new characters, etc... the typical concerns that stem from a series, particularly epic fantasy. However, there is a stunning ending along with more suspense and adventure and answers than you can shake a log at. However, however, however, you will still be begging for more more more. Please Mr. Sanderson may I have another? Seriously though, I'm not exaggerating when I say this is one of my favorite books. If the quality of the novels stays in pace this will be a monumental series. Real heroes in a world obsessed with darkness. Damn refreshing. But don't take my word for it, go to your local libra.... bookstore and get yourself a copy. 

PS. The hardcover is cool. The drawings are amazing. It's also cool on the nook because you can zoom in on said illustrations. Yeah I bought both versions, wanna fight about it?

It feels so complete and well rounded. There is clearly direction to the arc, and every moment is compelling. I've read nearly all on Brandons novels, and love his style, but this series is a statement for him. Clear as day, he has come in to his own and this series is the culmination of that."

Some whinge and whine that it drags on but personally I think it is superb - especially since I enjoy the historical element of these books not just the emotionally charged scenes.When I read a Gabaldon book I want to see, hear, taste and smell everything Claire, Jamie, Bree and Roger do. I want to feel like I am sitting on their shoulder, becoming part of their Clan so to speak. And in the Fiery Cross, that is exactly what I got.Take your time, read it at your own pace, and whatever you do DONT RUSH IT. The characters that become apparent in this one impact on A Breath of Snow and Ashes, so if you fly through this, you'll get lost in the next one.As always I cant praise this series enough, but at the end of the day, your opinion will be the only one that matters to you, however I hope what I say helps you make the plunge and embark on this amazing story with the same gusto you got reading Outlander aka. Cross Stitch. Brilliant read."
864,"The Fiery Cross (Outlander, #5)",0440221668,Diana Gabaldon,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"Having been hooked by Outlander, I anxiously awaited the sequels, and despite my vow not to purchase The Fiery Cross when it came out after waiting 2(?) years and suffering through Diana's Outlandish Cookbook (read: money-making scheme!), I broke down and purchased the new novel.     I should have trusted my first instincts and waited for paperback! I finished the book in three days and not because it was a page-turner...I was just waiting for SOMETHING to happen! This book is about 700 pages too long and the reader is forced to suffer through the menses of each character, more breast-feeding passages than a baby-rearing text, and countless (and I DO mean COUNTLESS) descriptions of Jamie's 'flowing molten tresses.' Although the central theme of the novels is the love story between Jamie and Claire, it seems as though the first 300 pages of this book was simply there to re-establish just HOW MUCH they STILL love one another. Ditto Roger & Brianna. By page 250, the author had established that Claire & Jamie and Roger & Bree would STILL sleep together...and that's IT!    There's a vague plot about the Revolutionary War coming on, also some other kind of plot involving Stephen Bonnet...but mostly the author resorts to flogging the reader with vignettes of Jamie & Claire and Roger & Bree's homelife. I have a home life with the every day banalities of kids and dishes and laundry and menses, etc. -- I don't want to spend my time reading about it too! This novel made me wonder if Diana is being paid per written word.     So -- if you're a rabid fan of the series, invest the $28 for the book. Or if (like me) you're tired of the author trying to turn spoiled Brianna and dull Roger into the exciting Jamie & Claire of Outlander, wait for the paperback. Overall, a disappointing entry in an otherwise good series."

They are tedious and heavy books that take awhile to read.  But, I still thoroughly enjoyed this one. I do wonder about some of the details.  It's almost like the editors were afraid to tell Gabaldon that she needed to take some things out.  And, it also feel like not a lot happens.  At the end, I came to conclude that it's a setup book.  It's preparing to you for things to come.  While the overall content of the book is basically day to day living on the ridge, there are events that happen that are important to the future.  I was completely dumbfounded with what happens to Roger.  There are some tense moments with the local wild life (including a snake and a buffalo).  I wish we could have gotten so more closure with Stephen Bonnet, but have come to accept that it isn't time yet.  I loved the interactions between the characters.  I loved what happens with Ian at the end.  But, most of all, this particular book just made me think.  I began to wonder if it's truly possible for a time traveler to change what happens?

865,Night Shift,0450042685,"Stephen King, John D. MacDonald",Barnes and Noble,4.3,Guest,"This is my favorite Stephen King work (and I¿ve read a lot   of them).  Night Shift is a collection of short stories from   early on in Mr. King¿s career.  There are 20 stories   contained within ¿ each quite short.

They may not be the deepest or most profound   things ever written, but they¿re fun to read and that¿s   what matters.  Another plus to this book is that the tale of   `Salem¿s Lot continues in two stories contained within.    ¿Jerusalem¿s Lot' is a prequel, while ¿One for the Road¿ is   an epilogue of sorts.  So you might want to check it out if   you were a fan of that novel.  If you¿re in the mood for   something fun to read to help pass a dull moment, Night   Shift is for you.

866,Jaws,1400064562,Peter Benchley,Barnes and Noble,4.1,JP_A7X,"If you are a reader that enjoys adventure stories this is the book for you. Jaws is a great story about how the little town of Amity deals with a bloodthirsty great white shark. One thing the author did exceptionally well was that he was very descriptive with the scenarios occurring throughout the novel. My favorite example of the description used is the first couple lines of the novel. Benchley writes, ""The great fish moved silently through the night water, propelled by short sweeps of its crescent tail. The mouth was open just enough to permit a rush of water over the gills. There was little other motion: an occasional correction of the apparently aimless course by the slight raising or lowering of a pectoral fin- as a bird changes direction by dipping one wing and lifting the other. The eyes were sightless in the black, and the other senses transmitted nothing extraordinary to a small, primitive brain."". This quote is shows one of the many ways Benchley uses description to paint a picture for the reader. Another thing the author did well was that he was able to make me as the reader feel what the characters were feeling. One way he particularly did this was through his excessive cursing, which really let the reader know how Officer Brody was feeling! I felt that the author did a great job writing the book, and to me he did nothing that detracted from the content of the book. Having also seen the movie, I enjoyed reading the book much better. The movie leaves out many parts mentioned in the book along with a HUGE side story having to do with Hooper that the movie completely ignores which I felt were a great addition to the story. As a whole and overall I really enjoyed the book as it was an adventure story full of action, terror, and left me wanting more. This book is appropriate for ages 16 and up as it has a lot of foul language and there are a few adult scenes that younger children should not be reading about. My advice to the reader is to sit down in a comfortable chair and start reading this fast-paced novel as you will become completely engulfed in the story of one Amity-summer-filled with terror."
866,Jaws,1400064562,Peter Benchley,Barnes and Noble,4.1,PainFrame,"A classic!

I think this book (like the movie) will be around forever, it's still terrifying.

What's interesting to me, being a fan of the movie, is the differences between the two. I won't ruin anything for you, but there is a huge part of the book which never made it into the film (probably for the best). Most fascinating was the difference in the end, including which characters live and the demise of the shark. I assume since Benchley worked on the movie that he approves of both versions. And for what it's worth, so do I. Great book!

I really look forward to reading this to my children someday... I remember that the hijinks this girl got up to inspired me when I was younger, although not necessarily to be badly behaved. Just to be more curious, like a ""thing-finder"" as Pippi and her friends become. Or to explore woods or look at things in a different way. A unique children's classic, to be sure."
869,The Elegance of the Hedgehog,1933372605,"Muriel Barbery, Alison Anderson",Barnes and Noble,3.8,ManUpWearATeeShirt,"I was weary of ""Hedgehog"" when my friends came to me in class on the day we picked what we would read for our book groups. We were all avid readers and didn't want to have to deal with students that would just use sparknotes in order to pass. This book looked interesting enough, and also had the sort of difficultly that would scare off anybody we wanted to avoid.

I am only fifteen, and even though I like to read, I don't consider myself to be very intelligent. That being said, the book was very daunting at first. The language was complicated, and I always had a dictionary by my side and a pen in my hand so I could write in definitions. Reading was occasionally tedious. My group decided to create a blog with a vocabulary list, predictions, and chapter summaries. There were times where we poured ourselves over only a couple of pages until we finally found meaning. It was a bit like one large riddle, and we were determined to find meaning. After a while, the book either became a bit easier to read or we became accustomed to the language. It went from taking me an hour to read ten pages to zipping right through it.

Even though it was an effort to complete, every single one of us agreed that it was one of the best books we've ever read. This book will make you laugh, cry, contemplate, and take notice of things you may have never seen before."
869,The Elegance of the Hedgehog,1933372605,"Muriel Barbery, Alison Anderson",Barnes and Noble,3.8,Carbentley,"This was just a delightful book. The two main characters are totally unique and quirky and become unlikely friends. There are many good movie and book references in it, which I always love, and there are some interweaving plots which bring a hodge-podge of personalities together. It is about who is really your family. And it treats the issue of how silly the rigid class boundaries are, and how they can keep you from discovering great treasures in one another."
869,The Elegance of the Hedgehog,1933372605,"Muriel Barbery, Alison Anderson",Barnes and Noble,3.8,FlashSR,"This book has been added to my list of all time favorite books. I was drawn to it initially by the title, without having read any reviews nor heard from anyone who had read it. The author quickly takes the reader to the luxurious apartment in Paris where the characters share their thoughts and minds. The combination of the intellectual, emotional and spiritual is what makes this story so powerful. Beneath the daily musings of the characters and their observations of their world lies the framework of our existence; the importance of beauty and art; ""the moments of always within never."" This book made me laugh, cry, and reach for my dictionary. It is a book that I will read again from cover to cover but right now, I find myself opening it to any random page and reveling in the powerful and beautiful writing. The combination of the descriptions of daily life among the wealthy, the discourse on such lifestyles and the ""profound thoughts"" shared by the 12 year old child offer an entertaining and thoughtful romp that will resonant with anyone who has questioned what its all about. And most importantly, remind us to look beyond the surface. ( and...Bravo to the translator!)"
870,Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,0743270754,"Doris Kearns Goodwin, Suzanne Toren",Barnes and Noble,4.4,IrishmanSpeaks,"The book's premise is that Abraham Lincoln was not just a great President but one who also had the motivational ability to create a highly effective team comprised of many of his rivals. These were men who had hoped to become President. Instead, they took a subservient role to a President whom Goodwin writes about in hagiographic terms. The team of rivals consisted of one time Republican presidential candidates William H. Seward, Secretary of State, Salmon P. Chase, Treasury Secretary, and Edward Bates Attorney General. The other major player in this detailed work is Edwin M. Stanton, War Secretary. This is a good read although the author is stretched at times to continually bring the overall premise together. The opening section of the book paints individual pictures of the major players, which I did not find particularly interesting. This I think is partly because some of the characters - Chase and Bates, at least to this reader are just not compelling in their own right. Thus it takes quite some time for the book to grasp this reader's attention. Although peripheral to the main story, the hardships of life during the first half of the 19th century become very obvious. Chase lost three wives and two daughters before he was forty four, while Stanton between 1841 and 1846 lost his wife, a daughter and his only brother. Another fascinating and heart rending aspect portrayed is how the Civil War tore families apart. Four of Mary Lincoln's siblings and three brothers-in-law fought on behalf of the Confederacy, while Bate's son also took up arms for the seceding states. Team of Rivals is basically a biography of Lincoln with a different twist. It is not as detailed as other works - especially in relation to some Civil War episodes, because the author tries to paint pictures of so many characters. Her portrait of Lincoln to some extent lacks objectivity. Every Lincoln weakness or vacillation has a logic or rationale. Lincoln undoubtedly was underestimated by rivals and media. One Democratic newspaper referred to him as ""a third rate Western lawyer ... a fourth rate lecturer, who cannot speak good grammar."" As a lawyer and in his early presidential years, the term ""inspirational"" does not come to mind. To some extent, his behavior did warrant this lack of respect. His lack of authority over his generals in the early stages of the war must have been disturbing for his cabinet. General McClellan treated him with a disdain and discourtesy that was mind boggling. Had Lincoln been more forceful with Generals Meade and McClellan, it is entirely conceivable the war would have ended much earlier. Kearns (and other writers) has tried to paint Lincoln as an accommodating, understanding head of state. It is probably more accurate to suggest as Martin Luther King did that he was at some stages a ""vacillating"" president. Much has been written about Lincoln's leadership, but I think, the student of leadership can learn as much from what Lincoln did poorly as he did well. Lincoln ""grew"" into the Presidency, winning over doubters and opponents slowly but surely with his down to earth, homely style. He most definitely has won over the author who paints Lincoln in very favorable terms no matter what the occasion. There is a tendency for the reader to become seduced by the portrait. Lincoln becomes more and more likeable, more and more presidential as the book develops. Ultimately, the rea"
870,Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,0743270754,"Doris Kearns Goodwin, Suzanne Toren",Barnes and Noble,4.4,MelissaP-bookworm,"I've ready many biographies of Lincoln, but never from this perspective -it is so well written and you see Lincoln thru the eyes of his contemporaries - how they first view him and how their view of him changes into respect, love and even an almost worshipful appreciation that no other man could have been sent by God to lead the country through such a perious time.  I had never appreciated the politician Lincoln was.  Crafty as a fox, he engaged in political practices we now use, that no one at that time thought of.  He was a deep thinker who thought way ahead of anyone else.Everything has come from the personal writings, journal, letters, and speeches made by his contemporaries and their family members who were eye witnesses to his life and time in office.  All his opponents thought he was a dumb, hick, rail-spliter with no education.  When he beat them all (democrats & republics) and then put the best of them in his cabinet. They all planned to control him like puppet masters. Yet, one by one (depending on their own wisdom and discernmen) they soon came to learn that Lincoln truly was the Best Man for the job and they all came to give him their heart's work in his behalf.  True there is back scene manuvering to get around Lincoln by a few malcontents but it ALWAYS backfires due to the ingenious handling of the situation by Lincoln.  He never treated an enemy unkindly, he showed warmth of heart to all, he was a man of the people and the first and probably the only true humanitarian elected president that stayed that way to the day of his death.This book is full of history that we never learned elsewhere.  It was certainly relevent today - apparently the current president-elect has skimmed some ideas from the book.  I hope everyone takes the time to read it carefully.  I'm certainly going to read it again."
870,Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,0743270754,"Doris Kearns Goodwin, Suzanne Toren",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"I read the first chapter online.  Bought the book the next day.  I thought $23.95 was a bit steep for a paperback.  But the book is extremely well bound, and the cover surprisingly resistant to damage.  But the content!  The content of the book is unsurpassed.  It is a superlative achievment in the field of biographies.    Having recently finished another of many Lincoln biographies 'With Malice Toward None', by Stephen B. Oates, I was fairly certain that I had read the most comprehensive account of the life an times of Abraham Lincoln.  I was wrong, dead wrong.  I highly recommend 'With Malice Toward None', it was a good read, but it was nothing compared to 'A Team Of Rivals'.    Few biographies are found that are actually hard to put down, but this is definitely one of them.  Save for 'Let The Trumpet Sound', also by Stephen B. Oates, 'A Team Of Rivals' is by far, the most facinating, educational, and skillfully written biography I have ever read.    Ms. Goodwin digs much deeper than one would have imagined possible in uncovering a myriad of little known facts and events, encompacing and surrounding the legacy of Mr. Lincoln.  Most biographers focus like lasers on the central subject.  Ms. Goodwin does this with literary ease.      What elevates her work to heights well above all others, is the fact that she skillfully weaves a wealth of relatively unknown information into her work.  Unknown information about the supporting cast of characters, in so far as it relates to the main.    With this book, Goodwin has succeeded in delivering an almost enthralling account of one of the most historic periods in American history.  She does a masterful job in calling both Lincoln, and his cabinet members back from the grave.      In this book, we see an animated re-enactment of one of 'the most' turbulent times in American history, all based history, lost letters, and documented facts.    With the opening of the first chapter, we begin to feel that we know the characters, and the very natures of each major player,  in much greater detail than history books are capable of portraying.    Goodwin literally brings her subjects to life. She brings us into an intimate realtionship with the people we are reading about, as if we'd actually met them during the times in which they lived.    This book is literally pregnant with little known facts. Facts that make the events of times immanently more understandable.  More understandable as to the catalysts that set those events into motion, and greater understanding of the historical results of those events. Having read several Lincoln biographies, I can now safely say, with considerable confidence: 'A Team of Rivals' stands alone in its class.  It has no equal.      It is a masterfully painted portrait, of the legend that is Lincoln.  Unsurpassed in historical facts, vivid detail, and narrative delivery.  A remarkable work of non-ficition.  The Pulitzer prize was never more rightly bestowed, and never more richly deserved."
871,"Dead in the Family (Sookie Stackhouse, #10)",0441018645,Charlaine Harris,Barnes and Noble,4.1,tana928,Isn't there a way for B&N to set up the review system to not accept reviews until the book is actually released?  Every review up until this point is worthless.  Some people give low ratings because they can't download it yet or the book isn't available yet.  That just skews the whole rating system and makes it of no use whatsoever :(
871,"Dead in the Family (Sookie Stackhouse, #10)",0441018645,Charlaine Harris,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,"Normally I do not respond to this kind of a thread, but I was getting frustrated reading some of the other posts. So here goes: Barnes and Noble allows early reviews because there is a number of readers out there with ARCs, or Advance Reader Copies of the books. This is mostly for the purpose of creating a buzz about a book before it is released to the mass market. I wish I could get hold of more of them myself, but that is beside the point. 

Instead of putting the blame on BN, politely ask the readers not to post any reviews of books they haven't read. That way, those of us more curious about the books can get accurate information from someone who actually have an early copy of it. There are plenty of other places and forums online where readers can vent and discuss books to their heart's content. This may not be the best place to do so. At least, that is not what I'm looking for on this website. Give me a good review that is not too opinionated (or speculative) or with an agenda."

This book disappointed me. 

SPOILER ALERT*********************** 
1.The story has no arc,no clear build up of anticipation. It was like cruising in a car enjoying the sites. 
2.The beginning of the book leads you to believe that it is about having a showdown with Victor. That story is barely touched upon and we see Sookie wanting to plot on how to kill him but is impotent to do anything about it. 
3. The chemistry between Sookie and Eric is gone. They use to burn up the pages but now they barely simmer. 
4. Eric, who always came across as the uber male bad a*# is weak and ambiguous in this book. A flimsy excuse for it is because his maker is in town and he is conflicted on how to handle him. Sookie wants him dead of course. 
5. Sookie's character development is disturbing. She has definitely changed. She has lost her innocence but not the faith she has in herself. She was raped and tortured in the last book and that would change anyone. Her attitude is reminiscent of Beatrice Kiddo in ""Kill Bill"". She wants revenge and death on anyone who has harmed her or her loved ones. Her personality is becoming closer to that of a vampire and I hope she will not choose to loose her humanity in subsequent books. 
6. I feel this book was for the fans because alot of little story lines from the past got wrapped up,(Bill gets reacquainted with his family). The story would be confusing to newcomers and I don't think they would appreciate obscure references. 

On a positive note I liked the subplot with the werewolves and I wish that would have been more developed. Sookie acted as a shaman to Alcide's pack and that was a very cool scene. 
I hope this book was just a bump in the road for Mrs Harris because she still remains my favorite author."
872,The Plague,0679720219,"Albert Camus, Stuart Gilbert",Barnes and Noble,3.9,rmishou,"Camus' classic is a must read.  As much great literature does, this book works on several levels.  It is a clear allegory about the dangers of fascism.  The plague begins to appear with the dramatic increase in dead rats.  The dangers are largely ignored until things have worsened and it is too late to stop the calamity.  Couple this allegory with astute insight into the psychology of human nature and Camus' work borders on amazing.  The town seems to resign themselves to their fate, barely fighting, as if already defeated. This book does not fall back to a typical medical thriller where the source must be found and millions are saved at the last minute.  Instead, Camus has people die and react to the indiscriminate nature of the disease, killing young and old, rich and poor.  As expected there are those who profit from disaster and those you have the money to buy the slowly disappearing food, but Camus resists the urge to cheapen his book with tricks and fabricated action scenes.  This books is an intense, existential  study of the human psyche in the face of a natural disaster or, allegorically, a dangerous, oppressive government bent on killing individuality and imagination.  Camus leaves the reader with the chilling reminder that the plague can lie dormant for years and return at any time."
872,The Plague,0679720219,"Albert Camus, Stuart Gilbert",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"Camus', The Plague, is a gripping novel that is definitely worth reading. Camus focuses on the human experience by illustrating the power that fear of an undiscriminating plague with terrible suffering has over an impersonal community  the power to bring them together. At the time, the people in the city of Oran, in Africa were distant, lifeless, and cold until forced into cooperation in a fight for their lives to stop the spreading plague and counteract the terrible human suffering.  With vivid imagery, Camus pulls the reader into the story and challenges what their mind can take. Visions of the Holocaust are seen through the way the people of Oran deal with the countless deaths caused by the plague. The narrator describes, 'The corpses were tipped pell-mell into the pits and had hardly settled into place when spadefuls of quicklime began to sear their faces and the earth covered them indistinctively, in holes dug steadily steeper as time went on.' The large amounts of deaths in Oran made the people and city loose all formality and personality in the deaths of their loved ones. Soon those people were just another body to bury among many.  With the constant idea of death looming over the heads of people in the city of Oran  they still found reason to push on, to beat the plague. The plague was soon taking no prisoners, it didn't matter if you were the wealthy or the poor of Oran  your life was up for the taking. Camus writes, 'But once the town gates were shut, every one of us realized that all, the narrator included, were, so to speak, in the same boat, and each would have to adapt himself to the new conditions of life.' Read The Plague and experience the struggle for yourself!"
872,The Plague,0679720219,"Albert Camus, Stuart Gilbert",Barnes and Noble,3.9,DeDeFlowers,"I am a huge fan of Camus. The Stranger and A Happy Death are two of my very favorite books. That being said, I had a very hard time with The Plague. The storyline is really great and I went into it with a good attitude, but I just could not for the life of me get into it. I thought it was really boring and strange to read. I could only read about half of it before putting back on the shelf. I probably will try again later.
All this being said, it is obviously loved by most of the reviewers, so it must be good. And if you like Camus' other stuff you probably will also enjoy this. I just didn't."

874,Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness,145162137X,Susannah Cahalan,Barnes and Noble,4.4,NJ-Nina,"This is a profoundly moving, true story of a young woman who, over the course of a few weeks, spirals into almost total madness.  Her loved ones stay by her side throughout her month long hospitalization watching doctor after doctor doing test after test handing down diagnosis after diagnosis.  When a doctor mentions a rare disease that may be the cause of the young woman&rsquo;s illness, her parents are left to decide whether or not to allow a test that may cause permanent brain damage.  
Susannah Cahalan&rsquo;s account of her life before, during and after her battle with mental illness is very well written and surprisingly readable.  As she delves into the working of the human brain the reading becomes a little dry but by the next paragraph, the reader is once again swept up into a story that is consuming and compelling.
I was extremely moved by this book and strongly recommend it."
874,Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness,145162137X,Susannah Cahalan,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Colleen33,"This is a remarkable book.  Author Susannah Cahalan is courageous as she shares her personal experience of &ldquo;madness&rdquo;.  She brilliantly writes about her bizarre and confounding illness that stumped many neurologists and takes us through her and her family&rsquo;s journey as they searched for answers to restore her health.  This book is inspiring for people/families who have ever experienced a loved one who has been misdiagnosed or has experienced loss in brain functionality.   I feel more informed and empowered by reading Cahalan&rsquo;s true story. 
 
As a person who has had a loved one experience rapid loss of brain function, I highly recommend reading this book.  I also recommend any books written by Ariel and Shya Kane.  I found great comfort reading their book &ldquo;Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment&rdquo; when my father had a stroke.  I found answers how to best support him and my family during this period of our lives.  I highly recommend reading Cahalan&rsquo;s book and seeking out the Kanes to support well-being in your life."
874,Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness,145162137X,Susannah Cahalan,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Read-by-Glowlight,"Susannah Cahalan, a bright young reporter for the New York Post, a talented writer with a career  full of promise, suddenly began losing her mind. One day she was doing brilliant research, and the next day she was too obsessive-compulsive about bed bugs to complete her assignment. Then she couldn&rsquo;t concentrate, couldn&rsquo;t track conversations, couldn&rsquo;t compose a simple paragraph. All for no apparent reason.

Day by day, hour by hour, reality slipped away as terror took over. Susannah doesn&rsquo;t remember the trip to the hospital or being admitted, but what she knew for sure was that she didn&rsquo;t belong there. The morning after a failed attempt to escape, she told the attending neurologist:

&ldquo;You need to let me out of here. I don&rsquo;t belong here. They&rsquo;re all saying bad things about me.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s talking to you?&rdquo;

&ldquo;The people on the TV.&rdquo;

She also heard people&rsquo;s thoughts, frightening thoughts about herself.

Then she discerned that her parents set up the whole scene: the doctors, the nurses, all of it, in order to trick her into being forced into the medical center. It was all one giant conspiracy.

In this candid and brave memoir, Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness, Susannah Cahalan reveals how it feels to be trapped inside a mind that&rsquo;s playing tricks and in a body that won&rsquo;t cooperate. It&rsquo;s all here: the madness, the details about the team of medical experts who tried every possibility to help her, her family&rsquo;s and boyfriend&rsquo;s responses, and the reaction of lifelong friends and strangers.

Her story is fascinating, horrifying, and most importantly, educational. We learn about the medical tests, the logic of the diagnostic hypotheses, and how the human brain works. We learn the questions the doctors struggled over, including the bet between two doctors as to what the correct diagnosis might be. It even includes original notes and drawings from her hospital stay.

What was destroying Susannah&rsquo;s mind? Was it bipolar disorder? Schizophrenia? Alcohol poisoning? Allergic reactions? Epilepsy? Demonic possession? No one knew and nothing they tried was working. In the meantime, she lost the ability to read and most of her speech. 

The one thing everyone agreed on is that something needed to be done fast in order to save Susannah&rsquo;s life.

This is more than a medical memoir; it is also a story of true and enduring love. Her mother and father, divorced and estranged, put aside their personal feelings to stay by their daughter&rsquo;s side through it all. Her boyfriend, the one her father thought of as a &ldquo;temporary place holder&rdquo; showed his true heart and strength by his actions. This part of the story is also important, because it shows the tenacity of love and loyalty.

My favorite part of the book is when her father gets down on his knees and prays for his daughter; and her mother, a Jewish skeptic, meets with a Baptist co-worker to join hands in prayer. Right after this, the family is led to a gifted specialist from Pennsylvania. A corner is turned, and in the end, Susannah Cahalan writes this amazing book. Near the conclusion, she writes that she makes a list of people to thank. I have to say, I hope God is on that list.

Fantastic book. Highly recommended."
875,"Wicked Lovely (Wicked Lovely, #1)",0061214655,Melissa Marr,Barnes and Noble,4,ThatWhichWeCallaRose,"I like to read fantasy for fun on the side and, after reading the description of this book, I thought it seemed right up my ally. After reading the first chapter I decided I would buy it at my next trip to the bookstore and I even found myself intrigued, thinking about how the story would play out for Aislinn in the time before I got to purchase it.
When I finally got the book I started reading right away. I wasn't finding myself getting really into the book or attatched to the characters. I decided to read on, figuring maybe I just wasn't used to this series, and as sometimes happens, I just needed to warm up and get used to the book.
Unfortunately, that never really happened. The story itself has potential, some of the characters are interesting (though they could definitely be developed more)...so I guess I have to chalk it up to Marr's style of writing, or lackthereof? It never pulled me in.
I was definitely curious as to what would happen and I read the book in practically no time, waiting for myself to become submerged in Marr's faery world...but then I finished the book, and it never happened.
The basic story outline isn't bad, and I think that Marr did an okay job of creating a basic world, it just needs major polishing and better writing technique...it's really just that Marr apparantly doesn't yet posess the magic it takes to pull you in, which really is what every story teller needs. That's the feeling people are truly seeking when they pick up a book, to be able to lose themselves in another world. 
Wicked Lovely wasn't capable of doing that, at least not for me."

I read the summary and simply had to send it to my friend so I forwarded the link. I read the first chapter and fell inlove with it. The next day I was at the mall and dragged my Dad into a bookstore at 9:00 at night. I learnt an important lesson...If your dad really wants to get home he'll buy you any book you want so long as he gets to leave.

The story is sweet and the illustrations are delightful. I would not, however, recommend reading it all in one sitting to a toddler. I broke the story into two readings and that seemed to work out pretty well. Also, even though this is not a chapter book, it seemed like a good way to introduce the concept of them.
My book is in paperback, which is fine since I'll probably be reading the book to my son. It is a good idea to reinforce the spine of paperbacks with clear packing tape. It will help them last much longer."

The rest of the book is still an adventure, that is deeply imaginative - creatively funny - and captivatingly ingenious.I hate a book or movie that is predictable, and this book was far from it.  And yet it tied most of the loose ends with a little bow.  The other loose ends are another story, and will be talked about another time =)"
877,The Neverending Story,0525457585,"Michael Ende, Ralph Manheim, Roswitha Quadflieg",Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"I first read this book as a teenager, and it should be required reading for anyone with an imagination.  I was so glad to see an edition with the original two-color text incorporated.  I'd contemplated buying the book for a long time, but could never find a copy with the red and green text.  I'm very pleased to add it to my collection now."

Yet I was pleasantly shocked to find that, unlike the movie, it is a psychological adventure with deep, mature themes.  Excellent fantasy."
878,A Beautiful Mind,0571212921,Sylvia Nasar,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"As a person interested in biography, history and psychology, I found this book to be well-written and frequently poignant. Some biographies degrade into a stiff, lifeless recitation of history, but this story is at turns interesting, insightful and compelling. It's been a long time since I have enjoyed a biography this much."
878,A Beautiful Mind,0571212921,Sylvia Nasar,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"Thank God someone has the courage to write a hopeful and honest portrayal of someone who is a survivor of a severe mental illness. It is a rare thing indeed to read something at all positive about the mentally ill. Bravo to the courageous and skillful writer of this book and her subject of study, Mr. Nash. Another wonderful new book to read which also gives hope to the mentally ill and the survivors of mental illness is the beautifully written new autobiography by Tracy Harris entitled 'The Music of Madness'. I highly reccomend both books if you want to be inspired and enlightened."
878,A Beautiful Mind,0571212921,Sylvia Nasar,Barnes and Noble,4.4,Guest,"The journey we call life is often filled with tensions and emotions which are a result of those tensions.  These things are the spices of life unless they loom so large in relation to our logical mind that they become bitter waters.  A trial it is, then, to have tensions so great or emotions so compelling that one is unable to live a 'normal' life.  It is interesting to see inside that space to which the logical mind is relegated when all other spaces are filled with the darkness of mental illness.  Peering out of the logical into the surrounding unfathomable darkness we readers can almost get a sense of what life with an  unrelenting mental illness is like.  The inspiration for us all is in the character's finding of the light and the regaining of the control of that dark side of the mind.  Another such journey from darkness into light is told by Tracy Harris in her book, 'The Music of Madness'.  In Ms. Harris' case the journey is of a brilliant Musician whose life deconstructs because of Mental illness and its tormentors.  It is at once chilling, fascinating, frightening, and like Nash she triumphs through sheer strength of will.  Both stories are inspirational, and both end up letting the reader feel that he or she just might have hope after all, no matter how high the mountain, or how deep the sea."

880,"The Summoning (Darkest Powers, #1)",0061662690,Kelley Armstrong,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Anonymous,"Chloe Saunders's life is flipped upside down the first time she see a ghost and it sees her. She's sent to Lyle House, a place for troubled teens. There she meets Liz, Rae, Tori, Simon, and Derek, five seemingly normal teenagers - well, as normal as teenagers with psychotically problems can get, that is.
But things aren't what they seems like in Lyle House. A place where its secrets could end up killing you. Incidents begin happening, raising suspicions on what's really going here.
With the help her unstable powers and a couple of ghosts, Chloe starts to uncover secrets about herself, the other residents, and Lyle House itself. She finds out enough to know that she has to escape.
At first, I kept saying, ""I'm not going to review this. I'm not going to review this."" What do you know, I'm reviewing this. After a few hours, I realized this was the only thing I kept thinking about.
The first few chapters were a bore. I was about to give up on this book, but instead, I skipped them - which should have really annoyed me, but with this book it didn't for some reason - and kept reading.
Things got interesting when Chloe arrived at Lyle house. At that point, the story never seemed to drop and it just kept going and going. Situations between the characters really draw you in and keep you in up until the end."
880,"The Summoning (Darkest Powers, #1)",0061662690,Kelley Armstrong,Barnes and Noble,4.5,Guest,This book was so much better that the Twilight Saga! It was full of action and suspense the whole time! I can't wait for the Awakening!
880,"The Summoning (Darkest Powers, #1)",0061662690,Kelley Armstrong,Barnes and Noble,4.5,katiesbookblog,"I absolutely loved this book!  I couldn't put it down.  I read it in one day, almost in one sitting but sadly I had to go to school.  I think my favorite thing about this book is how Chloe is just like a normal teenager except that she can see and talk to dead people.  Her mom died when she was young and her dad is always away on business so she is normally alone, except for a few friends and her aunt Lauren who tries to fill in for Chloe's mom.  She usually keeps to herself so when things start to get weird she can't really tell anyone.     So, at the beginning Chloe is in a school for the arts and she is just like all the other people in her school, except a little bit of a late bloomer.  On the same day that she gets her first period she also sees her first dead person or at least the first person that she knows is dead.  After being chased through the school by a dead janitor, Chloe is sedated and sent to the hospital and told that she must spend at least two weeks in Lyle House, a group home for unstable teens. Once in Lyle House, Chloe meets some interesting people such as Liz, Rae, Simon, and Derek.  Derek is a little scary at first, always sneaking up on Chloe and accidentally throwing her across a room.  Once she gets to know him, though, she realizes that he is just like her and can't control his powers.  At first, Simon seems like he is just in the group home to stay with his brother, Derek, but once she starts talking to him she realizes that he is a supernatural also but his powers aren't as obvious as Chloe's and Derek's.  Liz also seems to have some powers but she never realizes that she is controlling them.  She is transferred shortly after Chloe arrives because instead of getting better she seemed to be getting worse. Rae also may have powers but it was really hard to tell.  She was placed in the group home shortly after giving her mom first degree burns when she never had a lighter or anything else that could have caused them. There are others in the group home, such as Tori and Peter, but Peter gets sent home after Chloe arrives and Tori is the group's resident witch and not in the supernatural way.  Tori believes that because her mom is on the board of Lyle House she can do and get whatever she wants but Chloe interferes with her plans as soon as she arrives.  Tori manages to get Chloe in many terrible situations, some potentially deadly, but it's only because she doesn't want her mom to be disappointed in her.  Tori doesn't play a really big role in the story, all she really does is get everyone in trouble.Chloe, Derek, Simon, and Rae discover Lyle Houses' secrets and realize that, maybe they aren't there because they are crazy but because of their powers.  They realize that they need to escape and that they need to do it soon.  Once out, though, things don't go exactly as planned.  They are hunted down by the nurses and owners of Lyle House and chased through warehouses by guys with tranquilizer guns.  Once the girls escape and find a safe place they think things are going to get better but none of them realized that someone close to them betrayed their trust.  Of course, I'm not gonna say who.  That would give everything away.  I truly loved this book and if you really want to know how it ends you will just have to find a copy to read.  This book is first in a new series by Kelley Armstrong.  The next book, The Awakening, will be out on April 28."

I'm so glad that I bought this book. The author is a neurologist who describes some of his most fascinating patients.  I feel like these characters will stick with me for the rest of my life. Among the characters you'll meet in this book are a music teacher(the title character) who can no longer recognize faces, twins diagnosed retarded who can generate six-digit primes, and a murderer who forgets his crime. There's also a sailor who is convinced that it is still 1965. The cases themselves are amazing but Sacks treats their stories with a beautiful kind of dignity. Sacks never loses sight of the person, of the soul, that he treats. This book left me with a deep sense of gratitude and a fresh hope in humanity."

881,The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and Other Clinical Tales,0684853949,Oliver Sacks,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Guest,"The book was very fascinating and really showed how people in the clinical cases and people with the same brain disorders or  brain malfunctions lived. The book attempted to explain how, but more importantly, what was lost or gained because of the person's trauma or neurological disorder. It achieved its goal and showed a view from both the patient and the doctor. Even though the human mind may not be functioning properly, when closely looked at, the person has gained more than lost without them knowing it. This is the beauty of the brain and all of nature."
882,Eye of the Needle,006074815X,Ken Follett,Barnes and Noble,4.1,gailannsoebbing,"I was watching a documentary about thriller movies and it mentioned the 1981 movie ""Eye of the Needle"" which is based on the book.  I found the description fasinating and then the next time I was at B&N I found the book (I wasn't even looking for it).
It is an exciting novel with plot twists and suprises that could almost be plausible.  Mix a little bit of history with fiction and you have yourself a roller coster ride.  Reading the novel you keep thinking ""How is he going to get out of this?"" or ""Will they get to him in time?""  It is a very enjoyable book that I would recommend to anyone.  All I have to do now is find the film. :-)"
882,Eye of the Needle,006074815X,Ken Follett,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Anonymous,Very good book.  I was reading Spy Counter-Spy at the saME TIME AND IT WAS INTERESTING HOW ONE BOOK TALKED ABOUT AN INCIDENT AND THE OTHER BOOK CONFIRMED IT (EVEN THOUGH EYE OF THE NEEDLE WAS FICTION AND SPY COUNTER-SPY WAS NOT.
882,Eye of the Needle,006074815X,Ken Follett,Barnes and Noble,4.1,jimmyc776,Eye of the Needle was a great book. It was always hard to put down. The Eye of the Needle takes place in world war II. The book plays with your mind a little because it goes into the mind of two main characters. One of the main characters is a professor hired by the British government the other is a Nazi spy. The Nazi spy's codename is the needle named after his stiletto he uses to kill his victims.Faber goes undercover as British civilians and gives out British secrets to Germany through radio. His real name is Faber and even though he kills innocent people and fights for the Nazis he has a conscious. Then there is professor Percival Godliman he is hired by the British government to track down Faber. In the book Percival is always one step behind Faber. Faber finds out crucial information that could effect the outcome of the war. He has to give this to Germany in person and after a series of events he ends up at a woman's house on a island with her husband who is a paralyzed British veteran. They end up falling in love. I give this book a 9 out of 10.
883,The Blind Assassin,1860498809,Margaret Atwood,Barnes and Noble,4.1,Molinarolo,"This book sat on my shelf for several months before I had the courage to read Atwood's best work. Blind Assassin is for the serious or the literary reader. And, very quickly we are thrown into a novel w/in the novel. The name? Blind Assassin written by Laura chase and published posthumously after her death in 1945 by her sister, Iris. 

Iris discovers: ""Nothing is more difficult than to understand the dead, I've found; but nothing is more dangerous than to ignore them."" 

Did Laura purposely drive off that bridge? Do Iris' relationships to her father, much older husband, Alex, and even to Laura die in that car as well. Which sister is Laura writing about in her novel? And whom is the male lover in Blind Assassin that tells fantastical Sci Fi stories. Are they actually parables lifted from Laura and Iris' life to explain or justify each girl's choices? Or they something else, still yet defining Laura and Iris? 

Atwood never yields to cynicism, or contempt for her characters. The result; a rich world of layered truths and lies of Laura and Iris. Atwood uses Iris to tell their story, define their relationships-all of them-to understand the dead and finally lay them to Rest in Peace. Thus Iris is revealed, and finally at peace with her life-warts and all, in the Autumn of her own life. 
This book deserves more stars than this rating and the time it takes to read this wonderful story. I was very dissapointed that I had come to the last word. This marvelous book is a gem of an addition to my book collection and hopefully to yours."
883,The Blind Assassin,1860498809,Margaret Atwood,Barnes and Noble,4.1,osaka,"This book is so very different. It's got 3 stories going on all at once. It kept me wanting to find out what happens next. My first read by Margaret Atwood. This was excellent, I'll have to check out her other books."
883,The Blind Assassin,1860498809,Margaret Atwood,Barnes and Noble,4.1,swift__cat,"One of my favorite books of all time. The mystery of the plot is revealed in the unraveling of the past as the main character transforms from a young girl floating through life to a strong woman in firm possession of her identity. This novel is about the heartache and culpability of our inaction when the things we are not strong enough to see or realize are suddenly as stark as the death of a loved one. The heroine is anything but perfect. She makes mistakes that ultimately lead to unhappiness but in owning up to them and fighting, the reader both forgives and admires her. This story is unique, fast paced and well-written. Even if the plot doesn't strike you as something you would be interested in, I recommend it for sheer literary value."

885,House of Sand and Fog,0375727345,Andre Dubus III,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Peanut-Butter,"In a nutshell, House of Sand and Fog is a struggle over a house. While this doesn¿t may not sound like a very compelling tale, hidden within these pages is a struggle well worth putting some time into cracking open. In this novel, Andre Dubus III presents the stark differences between two nationalities and two lifestyles. Through the struggle over ownership of a house, Colonel Behrani, Kathy Nicolo, and Lester Burton experience their own personal struggles with the American dream, redemption, and what one wants versus what is right.	Kathy Nicolo is a recovering drug addict who was recently left by her husband and thinks that her family considers her a failure. Her life is falling apart and she is possibly suicidal. Through a mistake by the government, her house is wrongfully taken from her and sold in an auction to Colonel Behrani. Behrani was rich and well respected in his homeland of Iran. However, when revolution broke out, he and his family were forced to flee to America where he is unable to find work. He lost his money and his status as a result and sees Kathy¿s house as an opportunity to regain this. Lester Burton fits into the story on Kathy¿s side. A married police officer who was present when Kathy was forced from her home, Lester sympathizes with Kathy and finds himself pulled into the conflict as he falls in love with her.	The book is presented so that each side can argue its points. Each chapter flips from Kathy¿s point of view and Behrani¿s. In this way, there is no clear hero or villain in the story. You actually over time can choose which character is in the wrong and will find yourself rooting for either Kathy or Behrani to get the house. The problem here is that none of the characters are very likeable. Kathy¿s a miserable slob who let her life slip from her fingers because of her apparent lack of good choices. Lester isn¿t half-bad, but would go against everything he vowed not to do and walk out on his wife and kids just like his father. Behrani is an egotistical and power-hungry old man who would risk everything just to get his status back while claiming its all for his family.	Yet that¿s life. People are not perfect and Dubus has created characters with many flaws who hardly even try to do the right thing and likeable or not, this makes them all the more real. House of Sand and Fog is the story of ordinary battles fought by ordinary people. This is its brilliance, because it is easy to relate to these characters. Dubus puts you in the character¿s mind and allows you to sift through the character¿s perspective on the world. The intimate connection Dubus creates between the reader and his characters makes it almost impossible not to sympathize with them.	The book starts slow and about as interesting as a quarrel over a house sounds. Soon after, though, the character¿s struggles grab you. Even as the plot appeared unmoving, I found that I didn¿t want to put the book down. The characters personal struggles made me keep coming back to find out what would happen to them. And the book only gets better as it goes along. I wasn¿t ready for the twist near the end, and once I got there, Kathy, Behrani, and Lester consumed my every thought. House of Sand and Fog is a book that everyone can enjoy. I highly recommend it."
885,House of Sand and Fog,0375727345,Andre Dubus III,Barnes and Noble,3.7,Anonymous,"This book was very well written, and each character was able to provoke a response (although I did want to strangle one of the characters). This book really illustrates the struggle people have in trying to achieve the American Dream, and the way that love influences our decisions."

886,The Girl with All the Gifts,0356500152,M.R. Carey,Barnes and Noble,4.3,tpolen,"I admit I read a couple of reviews of this book before I began reading it myself.  The reviews were fabulous and hinted there was a big secret that shouldn't be spoiled by reviews that might give it away, so I immediately stopped, anticipating a mind-blowing twist in this novel.  About ten pages in, I figured it out and assumed since it was that easy, there must be something else.  But there wasn't.

Without giving anything away, this book is about a topic that's pretty popular right now, but is explained in scientific terms that made complete sense and I liked that.  Although the story was told in varying POV's, I especially enjoyed learning how Melanie perceived her world and had to make decisions far beyond her years.  I also found it fascinating being in loathsome Dr. Caldwell's head to understand how she justified her actions.  The relationship between Melanie and Sergent Parks was fascinating, and even touching at times as it evolved, although the primary focus was meant to be on the interaction between Miss Justineau and Melanie.  I thought Parks was more of a realist, while Miss Justineau occasionally refused to see logic, although I really admired her spunk.

While this book had several 'rush of adrenaline' moments, adequate pacing, and kept my interest, I thought the title, and even the cover were misleading and probably missing this novel's target audience.  On the other hand, those who were misled but stick with it may be surprised at how much they enjoy this book.

I would recommend The Girl With All the Gifts to sci-fi, horror, and dystopian readers - it was a different take on a subject that's been around for quite some time and was an engaging read.

This review is based on a digital ARC from the publisher through NetGalley."
886,The Girl with All the Gifts,0356500152,M.R. Carey,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"I received this book free from Net Galley and Orbit in exchange for an honest review. Thank you both for the opportunity!!

This book was nothing like I thought it was going to be and after a little ways into, I realized it was another Zombie book. 
Ugh, love watching  The Walking Dead, but don't like reading Zombie books. 

However, this one had a much different take on the genre and I found myself really getting into it. I really felt for the main 
character, Melanie, and enjoyed rallying her on. And, of course, there was the villain who everyone loves to hate. 

The book was an easy read and I did so in two sittings, only because I had to stop for an engagement. 
It was very well written and I would recommend it to anyone that likes the dystopian genre."
886,The Girl with All the Gifts,0356500152,M.R. Carey,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Anonymous,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The beginning really pulled me in and I found the whole story satisfying.

887,As I Lay Dying,067973225X,William Faulkner,Barnes and Noble,4,Guest,"Faulkner's As I Lay Dying is an outstanding book, however, it is extremely confusing. My English teacher, who required that we read the book our freshmen year in high school, told us that it's usually a book meant for grad students to read. The book is confusing, but Faulkner's style is unique and will definitely influence your own. His novel requires readers to stop and judge characters, it is necessary to constantly analyze. This is an excellent read for budding writers such as myself, because his style has had so much of an impact on my own. Read it not for enjoyment, because it is boring, but for the improvement of your own writing! It'll improve it so much, you'll notice it yourself."
887,As I Lay Dying,067973225X,William Faulkner,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"When reading Faulkner, you always wonder whether the book doesn't make sense or if you are just not as intellectual as is he. I like to think I'm not as intelluctual so my brain is stiumlated by the endless meaning and layers within his books. As I Lay Dying is not a happy story, but that is kind of evident within the title. The syntax and diction used is spectatcular. You find meaning in the way the text is written and the format of the words. In order to understand the novel, you have to read with a pencil in hand, underlining anything that seems important or significant because it most likely is signifcant. The characters are all narrators to the book. I believe, 17 total different point of views. The tricky part is figuring out whose story it is and what is the main theme. I always look at the book and try to figure out what is the meaning. As I Lay Dying gave me endless meanings and i loved being challenged to find them. Although it is simple with language and style, it is close to impossible to decipher the deeper meanings. You constantly second guess yourself because it is hard to know what is ""the right answer."" But after reading I felt accomplished, and dare i say, smart. There are so many meanings and none that probably come close to Faulkner's original message but it is worth discovering your own meaning to the story. I believe not only this book but all of his books give readers the opportunity to gain their own message within the text. Faulkner is brilliant and I recommend all his books. They are challenging and I believe are best with discussion groups just so you can hear what other meanings are found. I really enjoyed this book it is short, easy to read just hard to decipher bigger meaning. I find it challenging yet enjoyable. I hope you enjoy as much as I did :)"
887,As I Lay Dying,067973225X,William Faulkner,Barnes and Noble,4,BunnyFace,"So, I just finished reading ""As I Lay Dying"" this morning on my way to work. Let me start off saying that this is the second novel that I have read by William Faulkner. I became intrigued by Faulkner's works when a co-worker told me that ""The Sound and The Fury"" is frequently called one of the toughest novels to read, and he would be impressed if I finished it. So of course I read and somewhat followed it, and feel comfortable in saying that I enjoyed it. That said, starting with ""The Sound and The Fury"" made reading ""As I Lay Dying"" feel like a cake walk. I completely and totally enjoyed this novel, and would read it again as well as recommend it to friends. Now I feel prepared to take on more of his novels..next on my list is ""Sanctuary""."

889,"Lover Eternal (Black Dagger Brotherhood, #2)",0451218043,J.R. Ward,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Debbie-J-1970,"I really liked ""Dark Lover"" and I was looking forward to Zsadist's story in book 3, so I figured I rush on through this one to get to his story. I was completely swept into this book! I didn't care for Rhage/Hollywood too much in the first book so I certainly wasn't expecting to find him one of the best, most fun male characters I have read about in a long time! The first date scene where Rhage has dinner with Mary was so cute and endearing...for both of them. I loved Mary and I could see how Rhage feel for her so quickly. Though not conventionally beautiful, and scarred from her battles with cancer, Mary was a friendly, compassionate and accepting person. She learns he is vampire and wants to help. She learns about the 'beast' and wants to help. She sees the beast...and I wont' spoil that by saying how that goes...but this is obviously a caring and compassionate human being. I read some of the reviews here where readers didn't feel she was deserving of Rhage because she was whiny. She had battled cancer before, and now it was back worse than ever. She had battles of chemo treatments to look forward to..losing her hair... I have had some experience with people close to me having cancer. This woman had every right to be whiny and it wasn't even like it was over the top. I didn't think she was really even whiny as I read the book. She wanted to protect Rhage from watching her become sicker until she died. Like she had watched her mother. For the first time in a long time, I could really understand the attraction between two people that leads them to fall in love in the span of a book. Kudos to J.R. Ward for making me believe in this romance. Also, the other portions of the book were likewise amazing. The story of Z's fascination with Bella...the warrior to be being taken in by Wellsie and Tor..the lessers getting crazier by the minute. This book was chock full of good stuff. Put me on the side of the Black Dagger Brotherhood. Even though I may have to hide the titles when I am out in public, I am hooked!"
889,"Lover Eternal (Black Dagger Brotherhood, #2)",0451218043,J.R. Ward,Barnes and Noble,4.6,Anonymous,I thought the duality of Rhage was wonderful. Sooo beautiful on the outside but what was hidden beneath the surface was so ugly. Hollywood's longing for a special person was touching. He was not thrilled with the lifestyle he was forced to endure to keep civilians and the people he loved safe. Mary was pretty cool too. SHe had health issues but her spirit was strong. The depth of love Rhage demonstrated to Mary was just plain awesome.
889,"Lover Eternal (Black Dagger Brotherhood, #2)",0451218043,J.R. Ward,Barnes and Noble,4.6,supejunkie,"This book is the second in the Black Dagger Brotherhood Series.  Rhage is a gorgeous, ego-maniacal vampire warrior within The Brotherhood.  He's almost too beautiful too look at and has appetites that are almost insatiable.

Mary is a human counselor who has battled leukemia that was in remission.  She is about to have her life utterly turned up-side down and inside-out. She meets Rhage and finds out she is out of remission.

Because you are not certain which rules this author will follow (i.e. feeding from humans, no sunlight, reflections in mirrors) you don't know exactly what to hope for as an outcome with Mary and Rhage.

Every emotion that can be felt will be felt at one point or the other while reading this book.  If you are a true romantic you will probably openly weep.

There is lots of Mary and Rhage in Lover Eternal but you aren't left wanting for the other guys, either. Wrath, V, Phury, Butch, Tohr and Z are all on hand to keep us entertained.

These Brothers are Grey Goose drinking, Escalade driving, designer clothes wearing warriors that listen to rap music and know how to keep us captivated."

The Harry Dresden character is witty, sarcatic and oh-so-human.  How can you not like a guy who combines the grit of Philp Marlowe with the helpless charm of an Eagle scout?  Dresden is bull-headed, reckless yet clever and resourceful.  I plan on reading many more of these books.  Too bad Sci-Fi channel didn't renew the series."

After working with wizard Harry Dresden on a previous case, Special Investigative Officer Karrin Murphy accepts that the supernatural is real.  She believes a werewolf committed the killings.  She turns to Harry as America¿s only wizard to come out of the closet to help her on the Chicago werewolf killings.      However, Internal Affairs and the local FBI want Murphy and Dresden kept out of the investigation.  The honorable Harry would love to walk away and allow the humans to make a mess of things, but in good conscience knows an 'I told you so,¿ means nothing.  Harry and Karrin track the werewolf to environmentalist Harley MacFinn, but just because he is one doesn¿t necessarily mean he is the killer.  Perhaps his shapechanging girlfriend or a teen group receiving special tutoring on the finer points of lycanthropy 101 is the culprits.  As a dark side of a bruised Harry surfaces, he struggles to survive a war not of his making.      Harry Dresden is a unique character in the urban fantasy sub-genre.  Harry is a maverick whose mouth seems to get him in as much trouble as his actions.  He is a smart know-it-all, but cannot stop himself from saving humanity in spite of mankind¿s ridicule.  FOOL MOON is a fast-paced fascinating noir thriller that keeps readers interest so that the new fan will seek out the previous novel, STOP IN FRONT and the old reader will re-peruse their copy.

891,"Fool Moon (The Dresden Files, #2)",0451458125,Jim Butcher,Barnes and Noble,4.3,Chipperkeet,"I held off for a long time, reading these books, because, frankly, fantasy series are usually over the top, impossible to follow with a spreadsheet, and have no bearing on reality.

These books are the diametric opposite.  Yes, fantasy, but grounded pretty firmly in actual reality, monsters and magic notwithstanding.  The characters are well developed, and the plots are exciting.  When the magic stuff comes up, it's not delved into with typical fanboi excessiveness.  There's maybe a brief line of explanation into the magical workings, but in laymen's terms that aren't annoying. 

Five books in, love every one so far.  But make sure you read them in order.  The individual stories stand on their own, but there's a LOT of over-arching plotlines that continue, book to book."
892,"David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants",0316204366,Malcolm Gladwell,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"Does having a disadvantage make you stronger in the long run? Malcolm Gladwell explores this and similar questions in his latest book. Like his previous works, Gladwell delves into the stories of many people (some famous, some not) to determine why some become wildly successful whereas others crash and burn. Are there key elements in their upbringing that push people to excel?

Two interesting observations revolve around dyslexia and the loss of a parent. Some of the most prominent people in the world are, surprisingly, dyslexic. Richard Branson, Charles Schwab, and Brian Glazer are three. A shocking 12 of the 44 U.S. Presidents, including George Washington and Barack Obama, lost their fathers when they were young. Gladwell explores the possibility that people who are faced with a major disadvantage can use it to propel them to heights they otherwise would not have achieved.

While this book is very thought-provoking, I must admit that I can't completely agree with all of it. I found some conclusions to be over-simplified. Even so, this an entertaining and worthwhile read. Gladwell fans will definitely appreciate it.

Readers of this book should also consider two others with similar themes. Gladwell's stories reminded me of my favorite recent memoir, Dr. Anthony Youn's &quot;In Stitches&quot; which explores how a young underdog overcame his insecurities to eventually become a successful physician. 

 The second book I recommend is Gladwell's &quot;Outliers: The Story of Success&quot; which examines what factors make some people succeed and others fail. A similar theme as &quot;David and Goliath,&quot; this one looks at what intangibles contribute to one's success. It's a thought-provoking and fun read."
892,"David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants",0316204366,Malcolm Gladwell,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"Malcolm Gladwell has such a clean, lyrical, just downright fun to read style, that it is only by degrees, 
over a series of his publications, I have slowly developed the opinion that his surgically clean, 
brick-by-brick arguments are often fairly thin, sometimes blatantly card-stacked and may lead to 
highly questionable conclusions.

His latest publication David And Goliath, is, in my opinion, the most egregious in this regard.

Just today, I read of a study in the journal Pediatrics that found children without fixed bedtimes
were much more likely to develop behavioral problems by the age of seven. 
The conclusion pointed to restlessness, irritability and other issues related to the lack of sleep.
 Yet It occurred to me that was quite a leap. Isn&rsquo;t  it possible that parents who don&rsquo;t enforce 
regular bedtimes don&rsquo;t enforce a lot of things?  Isn&rsquo;t it possible that the children in the study developed
behavioral problems due to a lack of discipline and not a lack of sleep?  
I don&rsquo;t know which is the right conclusion, but would not publish the former as science. 

This is my sense of Malcom Gladwell&rsquo;s work; certainly in his latest work under discussion here.

A good example of what I&rsquo;m talking about can be found in the opening chapter, where he attempts to
provide a partial explanation for Goliath&rsquo;s behavior by suggesting that 
( according to &ldquo;many medical experts&rdquo; ) he suffered from the medical condition acromegaly. 

Sorry, but Really? 

How is anyone, Doctor or not, to diagnose a complex medical condition from a few paragraphs 
reported by a third party in an arcane religious text that, for all it&rsquo;s beauty, is not always known 
for its&rsquo; literal bent? It is like finding an ancient skull with a neatly bored hole in it and concluding 
the civilization was competent at brain surgery. Maybe an interesting thought.
Maybe worth a bit more research. But not a fact to be employed in support of an argument.

David and Goliath also lacks a focus. Though most chapters do pertain to an underdog them of
some sort, some do not. In fact, the underdog theme seems designed to roll out the 
Inverted-U-shaped curve theory, which then dominates the rest of the book. The book is more about 
the idea that you CAN have too much of a good thing ( be too rich, have too small a class size&hellip;) 
than it is about the little-guy winning.

Gladwell just doesn&rsquo;t put two and two together in this book. He features a lengthy chapter about
California's three-strikes law as yet another example of the inverted-U-shaped curve,
 yet his statistics in support of the failure of the three-strikes-law are anything but conclusive. 

In fact, he as much states that nobody really agrees as to whether &ldquo;three-strikes&rdquo; works. 
He indicates the law was eventually significantly watered down and leaves you to deduce 
that his proposed cause and effect was the reasoning behind it.

Lastly, and perhaps this is a bit shallow of me, but the subject matter of the book is often disturbing. 
There is a chapter that describes children suffering terribly from Leukemia. 
Another where a young girl is bound and tortured.  

It&rsquo;s selfish, I know. But I don&rsquo;t want to read that. I don&rsquo;t want to pay to read that.

As Woody Allen&rsquo;s fictional author in Manhattan once intoned while searching for an opening chapter,
 &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s face it, I want to sell a few books here&rdquo;.  That is how I feel about David And Goliath. 
Gladwell was on the hook for a new Bestseller but lacked the inspiration that led to the more
concise and &ldquo;tighter&rdquo; Outliers.

What we got was a collection of often disturbing essays that he struggles to stuff 
beneath a single umbrella."
892,"David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants",0316204366,Malcolm Gladwell,Barnes and Noble,4,MarketingGuy,"The biblical story of David and Goliath is a story of courage but also of overestimating strengths and misunderstanding the power of playing a different game to make the person who seems weakest be victorious.

In the face improbable odds, finding themselves inferior in scale, ability or resources is what pushes certain people to try things out of the ordinary, re-think the rules and play a different strategy &ndash; which is a formula for winning. This book makes the point in the story of Bedouins, David and Goliath and the underdog basketball team that goes undefeated.

Malcolm invites us to challenge the assumption that bigger is better. One of his key points is that when you are too big , too good, too strong &ndash; you advantage starts becoming a disadvantage. He challenges us to re-think our assumptions of what is good, what is bad, what is a strength, and what is an advantage. He points out that disadvantages can be advantages and that difficulties can produce resiliency and courage.

The central line is about the power of being different, becoming the big fish in a small pond that you create rather than being a small fish in a large pond &ndash; like the impressionists, who created their own pond, went against the current, and converted their weakness into strength.

Adversity has the potential to make us much stronger, more resilient and courageous &ndash; when it does not crush us. People who have gone through difficult times tend to think different, challenge the status quo, and take the bold chances that people who have had it easy have not had the need or the guts to do. Those who re-think the rules and take a new road are the people who change the world.

The second part of the book is about the idea that if you are Goliath, if you are in a position of strength, trying to dominate the Davids by force can be counterproductive. Authority requires legitimacy. The book talks about stories from MLK to religious clashes in Ireland to make the point. 


As you expect from Malcom, the stories are very interesting, enjoyable and even captivating.  Yet, at the end of the day the book does not leave you with a set of powerful ideas that you have not heard before. The story of David and Goliath is thousands of years old and has been told many times.

I did not find this book as intellectually stimulating as some of his previous books that have left me with a new way of thinking and have provided a foundation for more ideas to be built upon, like the Tipping Point or Blink. I can recommend this as an enjoyable read but not a breakthrough."
893,"Fullmetal Alchemist, Vol. 1 (Fullmetal Alchemist, #1)",1591169208,"Hiromu Arakawa, Akira Watanabe",Barnes and Noble,4.7,BATTOSAI,"Hey, it's BATTOSAI with another review, FullMetal Alchemist is a great manga but it's not for everyone, see why in my review of,
FullMetal Alchemist volume 1
Personal score 9.7 out of 10
Age rating 14+
Genre shonen(boy/men), action/adventure, drama.
The story to FMA is probably one of the greatest to grace the pages of manga history' two young brothers learned the ways of alchemy, and attempted a ""human transmutation""
(Taboo in alchemical law), to try and revive there dead mother, they ultimately fail resulting in Edward Elric (the older brother) to lose his right arm and left leg, and his younger brother Alphonse to become a soul in a suit of armor.
There's not much to the story in this volume, just a collection of mini stories, and it starts off in an odd spot but you'll get it fairly soon.
The extra stuff in the back is a classic staple for manga, and FMA has some good ones back there.  
The characters are really interesting, each with his or her own crosses to bear, and deep personalities.    
Now remember when I said ""it isn't for everyone"", well this is why, it deals a little in religion and politics, some might even go as far to say that alchemy is a form of witchcraft, well the thing is it's fictional, nothing but a work of the imagination, if you really want to make a stink about it go ahead, but remember people, it's a book, nothing more, nothing less, so if your sensitive to that stuff this manga isn't for you. 
The artwork is good and makes leaps and bounds in later volumes; it's an interesting combination of thick lines and sharp edges that make for a gritty, dramatic experience.
Manga to anime, read the manga, the anime is so far off the original story it will confuse you when reading the manga.   
I hope this review was helpful, and I plan on reviewing more FMA, so until then, good reading."

Having no one to take care of them and for the love of thier mother, they try to bring her back to life using alchemy. But failure wasnt the only bad thing that could happen, the younger brother Alphonse loses his entire body, he is only a soul now controlling a suit of armor. and Edward the older brother loses his left leg and then trades his right arm for his brother's soul that he transmutes to armor.

894,"Guards! Guards! (Discworld, #8)",0061020648,Terry Pratchett,Barnes and Noble,4.5,RichardSutton,"I was introduced to Pratchett's words only recently -- late in my reading career -- by author Henry Gee, who then stood back to watch the mental explosion. He was on to something, alright. Long aware of Mr. Pratchett's name, legions of fans and occasional witty quote, I had no idea how all-encompassing his writing could be. Guards! Guards! is my introduction to the author's beloved Discworld and my key to future submersions as well. It is a perfect tonic for our times and our silly culture offering big, heaping helpings of wry humor, cynicism and sarcasm. In my case, particularly, it came at a perfect time for a fan of George R.R. Martin's work suffering withdrawl until his next volume is released and in desperate need of comedic relief. Pratchett's novel takes place on the fetid, dysfunctional streets of a major city where a benevolent (?) dictator is about to be replaced by something much worse. Not even human, but sadly, in so many ways, completely expected. Dragons, it turns out are people, too. Misunderstood, subject to soul-numbing stereotyping and completely consumed by gastric issues. This book will keep you in stitches throughout and give you plenty of occasions to reflect on where our priorities lie. Don't wait. Hie thee to a bookseller and purchase this book. You sanity may well depend upon it."

895,The Year of Magical Thinking,1400078431,Joan Didion,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Cherie-Renfrow-Starry,"For clients who have lost a spouse, a child, a beloved family member, or a close friend, I recommend this book as a starting point in investigating the disbelief and numbness that accompanies a sudden death. However, I also recognize that this is not an easy book to read because it exposes raw emotions and forces the reader to consider his/her own views about death and dying as well as grief and grieving.  

Joan Didion is an award-winning writer. However, Didion did not become a well-known name outside of Manhattan publishing circles until 2005 when her 13th novel, The Year of Magical Thinking, was published. It subsequently won the National Book award for nonfiction. With the publication of this work, Didion found a new following of readers, namely, widows and widowers who had lost a spouse or partner unexpectedly. Her public pain, lack of focus, and search for direction at the sudden loss of her husband of 40 years, John Gregory Dunne, was complicated by the serious illness of their only daughter, 39-year-old Quintana Roo, who died just a few months before the publication of her mother's ground-breaking novel.

Didion had just turned 69 years old on December 5, 2003. On December 30th, John Gregory Dunne, her husband and co-writer, died instantly from a heart attack.  They had just returned to their apartment after visiting their gravely-ill daughter, Quintana, at Beth Israel North (hospital) in New York City where she had fallen into a coma after being diagnosed on December 25th with pneumonia and septic shock. Ms. Didion's rendition of what happened in the apartment is sparse, terse, impassive, and detached depicting what most literature describe as ""the moment of stunned disbelief that the impossible has become real"" ( p. 113).

Losing a spouse after 40 years of marriage is beyond traumatic. The fact that Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne were collaborators on numerous screenplays and articles as well as collaborators in a longstanding marriage marks the loss as inconceivable, as if one person was not only an extension, but the embodiment of the other. In an interview, Didion confessed that she had difficulty in finishing this book because it was the first writing she had done which John had not read. 

The popularity of Didion's memoir revolves around her candidness about the process of grieving the loss of a loved one and the process of rebuilding some semblance of life after that loss. Her loss is made more salient due to its suddenness and the concurrent stress of her daughter's illness. Moreover, Didion was the person to tell her daughter about her father's sudden death, only to subsequently witness her daughter's death as Quintana was rushed to the hospital with a brain hematoma while returning from her father's funeral. Because the book was in publication at the time of her daughter's death, Didion does not broach the subject of her daughter's death in this book. Rather, she focuses on her own grieving and mourning processes or lack thereof and outlines one of the most difficult developmental tasks of aging: rebuilding a meaningful life after the loss of a spouse.

895,The Year of Magical Thinking,1400078431,Joan Didion,Barnes and Noble,3.9,AKABookSnob,"Joan Didion's pain and suffering are profound and her loss overwhelming. I found this piece comforting from the point of view of having lost both my parents in the last year. It is intelligent, crisp and compelling. I am impressed with her bravery to write so intimately. Taking this journey with Joan is not easy. I think this book has to come into your life at the right time for you to love it or even appreciate it. Unfortunately, I think that requires having suffered the loss of a loved one yourself.   
This was my first exposure to Didion's work but I have already picked up two other books I hope are just as smart."
896,We Need to Talk About Kevin,006112429X,Lionel Shriver,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"I just finshed this excellent novel and I am overwhelmed.  The writing is outstanding, and I have not been able to stop thinking about these characters.  Kevin is a sociopath AND he is evil. Mostly, I am struck by Eva's love for Kevin, which is apparent throughout, but especially at the end of the story.  This novel is thought- provoking, disturbing and frightening.  I highly recommend this novel to readers who love to figure out the endings (I did, with the help of wonderfully placed clues) of incredibly well written books.  Truly the best novel I've read in a long while!"
896,We Need to Talk About Kevin,006112429X,Lionel Shriver,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"I picked up 'We Need to Talk About Kevin' because of the subject matter. Not because it was about a killing spree at a high school, but because it was told from the viewpoint of the mother of the boy who killed his classmates and a teacher. It puts a twist on the 'common' Columbine-like story.     The novel begins after the melee, as the mother, Eva, traces the history of her son Kevin back through his days as an infant, through all his apathy and wicked stunts growing up. She tells Kevin's story in long letters written every other week or so to her estranged husband. At first, this seemed like the actions of a crazy woman trying to re-establish her marriage. But who on Earth would ever want to reconcile with a nagging, pretentious woman who uses long diatribes with $10 words to fault you throughout your marriage?     Not until halfway through the novel was my interest fully grabbed and I didn't tire of reading another whiny letter from Eva. Up until that point, Eva comes off as a pompous woman with whom I really couldn't relate...and really didn't want to. You later realize, though, that this perspective is probably the way Kevin viewed her and why he held such resentment for his mother.     The story itself is a good example of the old Nature vs. Nurture debate. Are people inherently born evil? Or is it based on the way they're raised? Although this novel doesn't answer the question, it gives credence to both arguments and can make for an interesting discussion.     The ending of the novel is very dramatic and offers an interesting manipulation in events, which I appreciated. At that point, I was absorbed into the characters' lives and actually wanted more. I felt like a part of their 'dysfunctional' family. The characters felt real, with the exception of Franklin, Kevin's father, who resembled the 'golly gee' Mike Brady from The Brady Bunch (the movie version, not the TV one). It's hard to believe that Eva would ever marry such a naïve man. After finishing the novel, my only disappointment (and boredom) with the actual writing was that the author used an overload of detail to tell what turns out to be an excellent story. (My Creative Writing teacher would have scratched red lines through numerous sentences and paragraphs, as they seemed extraneous). Less is more!     If I learned anything from reading this book, it can be summed up in this one sentence: 'You can call it innocence or you can call it gullibility, but [she] made the most common mistake of the good-hearted: she assumed that everyone else was just like her.' On that note...don't watch your back, watch what's in front of you."
896,We Need to Talk About Kevin,006112429X,Lionel Shriver,Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,One of the most brutally honest books I have ever read. Taking such a different slant on such a tragedy was thought provoking. An unforgettable look at our culture and getting right to the core.

Otherwise you will have no clue what's really going on, and you will definitely not be able to appreciate this book as much. Trust me on this, my friend made that mistake.  Far and away the best work in the entire Vampire Chronicles, Queen of the Damned left me hanging on the edge of my seat from cover to cover. Unlike the other books in the series, it picks up exactly where the previous book, The Vampire Lestat left off. Anne Rice has long been one of my favorite authors and this one does not disappoint.  As in The Vampire Lestat, Queen of the Damned is narrated by Lestat. But unlike 'Lestat, Queen of the Damned includes side views and stories by others observers, and after all the events were over, told Lestat the story.  The action is spread out over six thousand years from one end of the world to the other, with a lot of mythology and pondering taking the place of the thrilling, energetic action of the earlier novels.  It is here that we come face to face with the origins of the vampires, with thousands of years of mystery and blood. We see our intrepid anti-hero, Lestat, both enraptured by and at odds with the most powerful vampiress yet.  My all time favorite character of her's is in this book Khayman a vampire so old he has forgotten who he is. This is such a rich and beautiful book that I would recommend it to everybody. It explains how her vampires came into being and answers so many of the questions that Louie had in Interview with the Vampire her first novel in this series."

It is written in a simple, accessible style, yet deeply portrays human emotions and interactions in late 19th century New York City. This novel represents an account of high society life of the 1870s. The events of this novel are wrapped around a prevailing lifestyle of jealousy, shame, and excessive pride which colors the main characters. Not unlike many other segments of the society, then and now, the characters of this novel attempt to disguise these feelings through hypocrisy and deception.
In a time where keeping appearances is everything, the protagonist, Newland Archer, is at conflict with himself. He is engaged to May Welland, who represents stability and the traditional high society life. He begins to fall in love, however, with May's cousin, Countess Ellen Olenska. After seeing Ellen and her freedom and spontaneity, he begins to question his life and why he feels the need to conform. He realizes how dull his life is and how materialistic and fake the high society aristocrats are. He loves May, but cannot stand the idea of living such a predictable life with no deeper meaning. In the end, he must choose between living the life he is expected to live with May, or being happy with Ellen, yet ruining the family name."
899,The Age of Innocence,159308143X,"Edith Wharton, Maureen Howard",Barnes and Noble,3.9,Guest,"So, I have to admit:  this was not my favorite classic novel.  However, I understand why it is a classic and I do feel it is well worth reading.  I have a few issues with some of the characters and I wasn't as moved with the love story as many others were.  To me, Newland did not have to marry May...he knew before he married her that he really wanted Ellen.  So, I guess I don't pity him too much and I really don't know what he expected to happen other than the fact that he would never be happy with May.  I'm really glad Ellen didn't allow him to cheat on May with her either.  At least she showed some class.  Overall, I loved seeing what old New York was like--wow, has it ever changed.  Also, I loved the themes and dialogue of the novel.  Follow your heart and don't live for others."
899,The Age of Innocence,159308143X,"Edith Wharton, Maureen Howard",Barnes and Noble,3.9,TulaneGirl,Loved this book. It gives an incredible view into New York society circa 1890's - all it's rules and duties. Newland Archer's conflict between what he wants to do and what he should do is engaging. It's heartbreaking to see him try to flap his wings only to have them clipped each time. One could say he should have had more character - the character to shun his duty and follow his heart. But it's hard to fault him for being an honorable man.
900,The Selfish Gene,0199291152,Richard Dawkins,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"I thought this necessary to balance out the religious fundamentalist who 'reviewed' this book before me. I'd like to point out that I've actually read this book, as well as creationist and intelligent design books.    In 1976, Richard Dawkins revolutionized biology not only by providing a compelling argument for gene-centered evolution (evolution being the only other choice other than us being magically made of dust a few thousand years ago) but by introducing the concept of memes.    Whether you agree with him or not, Dawkins' book is well written and deserves to at least be read in its entirety before being baselessly based by Bible-thumping, fundamentalist, reason and logic lacking creationists."
900,The Selfish Gene,0199291152,Richard Dawkins,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Guest,"I must acknowledge that this is perhaps one of the finest books I have encountered and read. The structure was very well thought out and written in terms that even an average individual without prior exposure to these studies can understand.   As for the poor reviews that 'Christians' are always giving Dawkins and other like minded authors and theorist. Stop wasting everyones time with your babbling reviews of repentence and redemtion and persecution. No one has asked for you to agree with our opinions/theorizations on the evolution of life and frankly we do not waste our time in attempting to persuade you to accept our opinions. A word to the Christian. PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH. Stop being selective in your Biblical scriptures and finding ways to twist what your Bible says. If you are going to defend your beliefs, stick with your guidelines in your   Bible, NOT what you misconstrue."

901,Year of Wonders,0142001430,Geraldine Brooks,Barnes and Noble,4,regina77004,"I went into this read really wanting to love it since I've heard such great reviews.  While there were aspects I greatly appreciated, I was sorely disappointed.  The main reason lies in the plausibility of a multitude of circumstances.  Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the concept of suspension of disbelief.  However, for me, I tolerate it less in historical fiction than other genres.

Inspired by actual events that occured when residents of Eyam Derbyshire voluntarily quarantined themselves in response to an outbreak of The Plague, Brooks allows the full range of human responses to play out.  Some residents see the outbreak as a punishment from God and commit to extreme penitence such as self flagellation, others turn on their neighbors, others collapse under their own greed, and some focus on service.  

There are some things with which Brooks does an excellent job. Within a fairly short novel, Brooks aptly develops rich characters that truly reflects human nature.  Her protagonists have flaws.  That was refreshing, particularly when contrasted with their extreme heroic actions.  The story itself is well developed, and she is able to portray the emotions of the characters in a vivid manner.

Where she lost me was in the intuitive knowledge that Anna is imbued with. It just really irritated me.  I couldn't figure out why Anna had not discovered a cure for The Plague. Further, the historical context for some of the medical knowledge seems a bit stretched by about 100 years."
901,Year of Wonders,0142001430,Geraldine Brooks,Barnes and Noble,4,Kaco2000,"I just this moment finished reading Year of Wonder. Anytime I find myself talking to the pages as if they would me in reply I know it¿s a great read. I was elated to get to the end as the ending was not at all what I expected.  As a matter of fact I scarcely imagined Anna & Michael¿s rendezvous, though I hoped for it once Elinor was gone. The story is fluid & engaging & it drew me in like a friend confessing a her truth to me in confidence. I am glad that I generally choose what I read based on the way the cover looks. Year of Wonder like the painting on the cover is a sensual, full-bodied tale chocked full of historical references & language (including idioms that I had to research)that made the story most believable. I was swept into the story & enjoyed it immensely. I plan to add this to my own library so that I may read it again.I highly recommend the book to anyone  - man or woman, who has a taste for brilliant literary storytelling."
901,Year of Wonders,0142001430,Geraldine Brooks,Barnes and Noble,4,review4U,I am innately suspicious of any historical novel with a woman on the cover. If you are looking for the sort of escapism found in a bodice ripper you are in for a disappointment. It is a well researched literary novel that only sags into sappy sentimentality a few times towards the end. Women are the majority of literary fiction readers. Yet 'Year of Wonders' escapes being a classic 'woman's' novel despite the fact that the main protagonist is a strong woman. Because of its interesting historical detail and plot it may even be of interest to some very enlightened men. It reminded me of Arthur Miller's play 'The Crucible' and some of the other fiction about the Salem witch hunt. It seems like a very good choice for book clubs as it raises some good questions. Enjoy.
902,"The Black Echo (Harry Bosch, #1; Harry Bosch Universe, #1)",0446612731,Michael Connelly,Barnes and Noble,3.8,ashoubre,"This is the first book of the thrilling Harry Bosch Series. Although this book isn't my favorite of the series, it really sets you up and helps you get to know Harry and how he operates. Michael Connely is a fantastic writer who gets better and better with each book he writes! This series gets your heart pounding as Harry Bosch gets closer and closer to the killer. When the book is over, only then will you realize you were holding your breath the whole time, and you won't be able to wait to pick up the next in the series. 

If you are planning to read this series I suggest that you go to Michael Connelly's web site and get a list of all his books. He also has the Terry McCaleb, Jack McEvoy, Rachel Walling and Mickey Haller series that all intertwine with the Harry Bosch series. I recommend that you read the books in the order they were written because it lets you get to know and understand these characters as they will all come into contact and have relations with Harry Bocsh in the following books. Enjoy!"

   While it is true this book contains many of the common cliches of crime novels,as other reviewers have stated,they don't take away from the readers enjoyment of this book.The story and characters still come off as believable.The occasional element of humor throughout the book makes it all the more enjoyable.The scene when Harry handcuffs the two internal affairs officers to the tree had me laughing out loud.All in all a good page turner."

I enjoyed the read, especially after reading a dreary cheap Nook book. I have already bought the second Harry Bosch book, Black Ice, and look forward to getting into that!"
903,Anthem,0452281253,Ayn Rand,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"ANTHEM is a moving novel that makes you think about everything around you. Ayn Rand shows the reader a completely different world. That doesn't know the word I they only know we and they always think of the greater good. It especially makes you think about your freedoms and rights. Equality 7-2521 is an example of a person without rights or freedom in a world where everyone is equal and a few select people are allowed to think and use their creativity. 
The setting in the novel is in a world where there is no technology. Equality is a street sweeper who isn't allowed to you his intellectual abilities. When cleaning one day Equality finds a tunnel and in this tunnel are a light bulb and a circuit breaker which have electricity. Equality then feels like he has discovered something that the world has never known about. Ayn Rand uses this because it is the privilege in which we take most advantage of and she shows use a world without electricity. Can you imagine a world without electricity? No computer, television, air conditioning, and most importantly no lights. Just like in the novel where they have no lights instead they use candles because in their society lights are banned. 
Another event that changes the story is when Equality and the Golden One (the girl he falls in love with) find the vacant house in the Forbidden Forest. This house is special to the story because it is filled with modern day amenities such as lights, beds, bathrooms, and other things that we take for granted. The largest impact of this house is that she points out the flaws of society and how we have so much that we don't need or even waste. But in the house Equality finds things that are left from the society that we have today and he learns to be able to think and try things and even have ideas of his own.
 When Equality is reading a book in the house he finds a word that he had never heard or seen before and it's the word I. Which to us doesn't seem like much but in a world where there is no ""I"" and everything is ""we"" it is a big deal. 
After learning this word he starts to realize its power and how it helps people and life grow, so he decides to start a new life with the Golden One and in this new society everyone will know the power of the word I."
903,Anthem,0452281253,Ayn Rand,Barnes and Noble,4,Susie_Derkins,"Some people find the society Ayn Rand creates in Anthem to be extreme.  That being said, one must consider the perspective of a teenage girl in Soviet Russia whose father's pharmacy was taken by the communist government.  The notion that everything belongs to the collective ""We"" and that one exists solely for the good of the state would surely lead to intense feelings of helplessness, anger, and frustration.  Hence, Anthem.  Told through the eyes of Equality 7-2521 in a society where there literally is no I in Team, the hero attempts to break from the herd and discover what once was, fueled by the mystery of the Unspeakable Word.  An interesting choice for book groups!"

904,"Gabriel's Inferno (Gabriel's Inferno, #1)",1936305623,Sylvain Reynard,Barnes and Noble,4.2,skyla11377,"OMG, this book was beyond AMAZING. When I was told how fantastic this book was I was skeptical because you just never know. I read the blurb and I was interested. When I started reading it I so know what my friend meant. I had such a hard time putting it down. I was so desperate to keep reading it that when I was at my 3 year old niece's birthday party I pulled out my iPod so I could keep reading it. THAT is how HOOKED I was....LOL. Gabriel's Inferno is so hard to put into words because I am having a hard time trying to make you all understand just how much this book is A MUST READ. My friend described it as EPIC and I can't tell you how much I agree with her. Gabriel is such a complex character that, at first, you want to write him off as a BIG TIME jerk but upon further inspection you realize he is just an extremely self-tortured soul. I say self-tortured because Gabriel doesn't allow himself any room for forgiveness, therefore, he is always consumed by what he perceives to be a nonredeemable soul. Julianne, is just a young girl at heart, with a crush that never went away but she is also a woman with, what she believes, to be a shameful secret. Julia has loved Gabriel since the first time she ever saw him, but circumstances beyond either of their control has kept them apart for 6 years. When Julia comes face to face with her secret crush she is devastated to realize he doesn't even remember who she is, let alone what she means to his family. Gabriel, for his part, is almost blind to what is right in front of him. To him, miss Mitchell is, nothing more than a bothersome grad student who happens to be in his Dante Seminar class. BUT, the more time he spends around her the more he starts to feel things he never thought possible.  When he learns that Julia is his long lost ""Beatrice"", Gabriel pulls out all the stops to make Julianne see how much they belong together. Even though both character's are struggling with their own inner turmoil they are determined to not let the other one see for fear that it will ruin their fragile serenity. Julia's innocence and Gabriel's jaded past is what makes these two such captivating characters. This book is PHENOMENAL, I  can't stress that enough. To me, this series (yes, there is going to be a book 2) is right up there with The Twilight Saga and The Harry Potter Series (in my humble opinion). On a scale from 1-10 I give Gabriel's Inferno a 20. Yes, it is off the scale because this book is just that incredible. I can't think up enough creative words to say how amazing this book is. Everyone needs to pick up a copy of this book."
904,"Gabriel's Inferno (Gabriel's Inferno, #1)",1936305623,Sylvain Reynard,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Elletee,"Sylvain Reynard's writing is like no other I have ever experienced.  A sense of hope, together with his wisdom and kindness shine through each chapter as this beautiful romantic love story unfolds. This is a journey where I have learned to appreciate poetry, art, music and literature.  The characters have become loved friends who I care about deeply and want good things to happen to.  Thank you SR. Just thank you."
904,"Gabriel's Inferno (Gabriel's Inferno, #1)",1936305623,Sylvain Reynard,Barnes and Noble,4.2,Cecita,"If you are looking for a follow-up book, this one it is not. It started strong; seemed like there would be a lot of content. But then...fell flat. The hero changes his personality overnight. There were some good moments, definitely, but not enought to sit through the whole book. You will be particularly disappointed if you are looking for hot sex scenes. Let me tell you, you wait a VERY long time for it and it is so uncomfortable to read! May I also add, the whole virgin storyline got old quick. Yes, the heroine is a virgin. I don't want to hear about it for 200 pages! And how he will be her first...ugh! To sum up, it had potential, not awful but it didn't deliver."

	This story starts off with a grandfather who tells his grandchildren about a town called Chewandswollow. This looks like any other town at first glance, but there are no grocery stores and restaurants have no kitchen. This town has crazy weather 3 times a day at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It rains eggs and bacon or hamburgers every kind of food one can think of.  Life in this town was wonderful for the  people until one day it took turn for the worse. During one of the meals the food started to get bigger and bigger. It started to crush cars and buildings. A giant pancake fell on the school so children could not attend. Food that didn't go together stared to fall. They were in the middle of a huge food storm. The town's people didn't know what to do should they stay or should they evacuate their beloved town. And how should the leave their town of Chewandswollow. Read this book and see what happens to this town you won't be sorry.
	This is a great fun story for children of any age.  It has great and colorful illustrations that all children will enjoy. This book could be used for in class activities from kindergarten to 5th grade. This book would be a great to do a whole unit plan on. One suggestion is a lesson on food groups students can learn about the different food groups and see how many of those food groups were represented in the story. Another lesson can be done on. Another good lesson would be on weather.  Students can learn about the different types of weather factors associated with the types of weather and they can predict the weather for the next week. These are just a few suggestions of lessons for this book but the possibilities are endless."
906,Major Pettigrew's Last Stand,1400068932,Helen Simonson,Barnes and Noble,4,Frisbeesage,"What a fabulous book! I fell in love with Major Pettigrew from the start. He is so gentle and dryly humorous, willing to own his faults, humble and yet completely fallible and human. When he falls in love with Mrs. Ali, the Pakistani shopkeeper in their small English village, he does it wholeheartedly. Yet their relatives and neighbors disapprove and they have to fight racism, ignorance, and censure to stay together. The author, Helen Simonson, does a great job of addressing nasty issues with a light and gentle hand. The Major struggles with what his beliefs confronting religion, environmentalism, and racism with his wisdom and humor. The plot is fast-paced and interesting making this a real page turner with a surprising twist at the end. A fun, heartwarming book that nevertheless examines some serious social issues."
906,Major Pettigrew's Last Stand,1400068932,Helen Simonson,Barnes and Noble,4,1louise1,"An older, distinguished gentlemen expanding his friendship with a mature lady friend in the English countrywide, is a beautiful unconventional love story, wry and witty, frequently hilarious. GREAT HUMAN SPIRIT AND FEEL GOOD READ! I loved it!"
906,Major Pettigrew's Last Stand,1400068932,Helen Simonson,Barnes and Noble,4,Anonymous,"Helen Simonson's 'Major Pettigrew's Last Stand' is a novel of love and grief and family and relationships. And while the fact that the major characters are fifty plus may be beside the point, it is nevertheless refreshing to see that the aged and aging may have real lives.

Widower Major Ernest Pettigrew, veteran of Her Majesty's Service and stanch upholder of all things British, is attracted to Jasmina Ali, the Pakistani matron who runs the village shop. No reader will be surprised that the members of the Major's golf club aren't impressed by his choice nor is Jasmina's family pleased that she has a British suitor. Ernest is expected to marry the local spinster (after a little not too genteel nudging by the ladies circle) and Jasmina's in-laws are expecting her to relinquish her shop to her nephew and 'retire' to the safety and servitude of family obligation. 

However, this is less a story of plot than character. And Simonson does an excellent job of rendering each of her characters - from the upright and moral major and his sometimes greedy and consistently unsure son Roger with his flip yet sympathetic American girlfriend to the lovely and wise Jasmina and her serious, scholarly, and equally greedy and unsure nephew Abdul - with great depth and flair.

Five Stars: Recommended for all readers who want to be reminded of the cost and power of love and who want to smile as they close the book at the end."

908,The Tenth Circle,074349671X,Jodi Picoult,Barnes and Noble,3.8,Guest,"Jodi Picoult's THE TENTH CIRCLE verges on genius for a new literary style to add to her tight rope walking ideas that she always presents in her books.  Her new book is 10% cartoon book which covers all the intricacies of Dante's Inferno with the wonderful style of the adult superhero cartoonest. Once again she presents a book that is a must do for all reading groups.  What would we be willing to do for our child? Do we have any control over our darker, vengeful sides?  Can we learn from mistakes and become better people? Are human being redeemable?  Parental angst for the life styles of our teenagers is played out extremely well in this very compelling story line.  I would recommend that anyone who has not not found Jodi Picoult should go right out and pick up all thirteen of her easy reading, thought provoking, timely issues books.  A superhero winner, Jodi Pidoult!!"

It’s Best Picture. Period. 

The last person I’d expect to be scared was Steven Spielberg. 

Stay with the times, bro. 

What Alfonso Cuaron did with ROMA was quite an achievement. Same for MUDBOUND."

2486,The Buried Giant,030727103X,Kazuo Ishiguro,Twitter,"The snobery does go both ways, doesn't it? Ishiguro got it in the neck for making some quite reasonable observations re The Buried Giant.

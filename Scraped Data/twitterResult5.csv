An earlier version misstated Mr. Wolfe’s age and birth date. He was 88, not 87, and he was born on March 2, 1930, not 1931. The earlier version misstated the title of a novel he published in 2004. It is “I Am Charlotte Simmons,” not “I Am Charlotte Curtis.”"

4081,I am Charlotte Simmons,312424442,Tom Wolfe,Twitter,When Tom Wolfe’s “I Am Charlotte Simmons” came out in 2004 it was pilloried by elite college grad reviewers as heavy handed and unrealistic.

Every time u talk about Love,
I feel, u r about 2 set a #trap ,

I respect ur emotion,
But this is my mental condition,

I don't know,
How long I will pay the price,

I m unsure, 
Can love happen twice?

5035,Shadow Divers,965925072,Robert Kurson,Twitter,"I think my favorite type of book is non-fiction told with a sometimes fictional, storytelling style. Some favs:

- Moneyball
- River of Doubt
- Shadow Divers
- The Fish That Ate the Whale
- The Last Days of Night

Any recs?"
5035,Shadow Divers,965925072,Robert Kurson,Twitter,"Just read Shadow Divers. Great book! Takeaways:

1) Much of history is wrong. Reminds me of @AmuseChimp’s line: “if the news is fake, imagine history.”

2) Be the best in the world at something and luck finds you.

3) Shipwreck diving is freakin intense. Respect to the committed."

1. The reason to come to Eleuthera is beach hunting. As in hunting for beaches. And they are spectacular.

2. The book “Shadow Divers” is as good as @patrick_oshag said. So, so enjoyable. Hope you’re feeling better dude."

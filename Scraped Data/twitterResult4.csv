3264,"Noble House (Asian Saga, #5)",440164842,James Clavell,Twitter,"1905 would be able to bring in and update the Japanese and Russian stories mentioned in Gaijin and Noble House, plus changing the tone of the Asian Saga with Japan as a major power exerting political, economic & military pressure in the Asia-Pacific.

It could involve a Marlowe."
3264,"Noble House (Asian Saga, #5)",440164842,James Clavell,Twitter,"That would be absolutely incredible.

One major missed opportunity of the Asian Saga? Bartlett from Noble House and Corporal King from King Rat should have been the same person, and Marlowe reuniting with him in 1960s Hong Kong should have been a HUGE deal."
3264,"Noble House (Asian Saga, #5)",440164842,James Clavell,Twitter,"I'm not anywhere near his level, but it was a daydream of mine once to be given permission to write more in his Asian Saga. Some of the stories mentioned in Noble House about Hag Straun during the Gilded Age are just crying out for a proper novel. Ah, well."
3264,"Noble House (Asian Saga, #5)",440164842,James Clavell,Twitter,Tai Pan was also awesome especially with Gildart Jackson's Scottish accents.

3966,"Teacher Man (Frank McCourt, #3)",743243781,Frank McCourt,Twitter,It has been suggested (by those I respect) that it would be great to write my memoir around my life so far as a teacher. I think of Frank McCourt's teacher man but I wonder: how does one tell all the tales without poking the hornet's nest that is education politics. Advice sought
3966,"Teacher Man (Frank McCourt, #3)",743243781,Frank McCourt,Twitter,"Two literary genres that I wish more people would read:
1. Plays (especially Pirandello, Albee, O'Neill, Shange, & Hansberry)
2. Memoirs (from Frank McCourt's Angela's Ashes, 'Tis, & Teacher Man, to Trevor Noah's Born a Crime)

Sadly, these genres are often skipped in college."
3966,"Teacher Man (Frank McCourt, #3)",743243781,Frank McCourt,Twitter,I recommend “Teacher Man” because the reader experiences the development of Frank McCourt as an educator. “Teacher Man” has an array of students over his 30 years of teaching. The complex life events of fatherhood & love highlighted in the book showcase his reality. @TJAPEnglish
3966,"Teacher Man (Frank McCourt, #3)",743243781,Frank McCourt,Twitter,“A young substitute teacher sat beside me in the teacher’s cafeteria.

3966,"Teacher Man (Frank McCourt, #3)",743243781,Frank McCourt,Twitter,A1: Teacher Man by Frank McCourt inspired me when I first started teaching. It's about his journey through his first year teaching. It always stuck with me & helped shape me into the teacher I am today. I am me! Not what others think I should be. #redtechguy

This hits me the very week that I’m finally reading @robsheff’s lovely Love Is a Mix Tape, after years of intending to do so."
3985,Love Is a Mix Tape,1400083028,Rob Sheffield,Twitter,I started reading @robsheff “Love is a Mix Tape ...” based on a recommendation from @Harry_Styles - i can’t put it down.

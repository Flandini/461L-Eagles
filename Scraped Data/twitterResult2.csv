1460,In a Sunburned Country,767903862,Bill Bryson,Twitter,"Which one was that? I personally recommend both ""True Girt"" by David Hunt and ""In A Sunburned Country"" (I think over there it was published as ""Down Under"") by Bill Bryson. Seriously, I learned a lot but they are two of the FUNNIEST informative books I've ever read."
